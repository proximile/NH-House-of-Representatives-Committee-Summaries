apparently you don't
 
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 align:start position:0%

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.590 align:start position:0%

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
begins the hearing we begin the hearing
 
00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1481 repealing the statute
 
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
relative to medical freedom in
 
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.590 align:start position:0%
relative to medical freedom in
immunization

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes the prime
 
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill representative
 
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you much mr chair i'm um
 
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
i'm uh the prime sponsor hb 1481 an act
 
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
repealing the statute relative to
 
00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
medical freedom and immunizations
 
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
which from what i've seen is probably
 
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
doing something somewhat different than
 
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
what the other bills you're hearing
 
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
today will be doing in fact
 
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
start out by so i'm represented timothy
 
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 align:start position:0%
horrigan from stratfor county district
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
six the towns of durham and madbury and
 
00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh durham is the
 
00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 align:start position:0%
home of the university of new hampshire
 
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.870 align:start position:0%
which is
uh

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
somewhat related to the reason why i
 
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill but this
 
00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
so there is no first one i'm going to
 
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
say there is no natural legal or
 
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional right
 
00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 align:start position:0%
to spread any communicable disease
 
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 align:start position:0%
especially not a respiratory virus like
 
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
covet 19 which has killed over 900 000
 
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.190 align:start position:0%
covet 19 which has killed over 900 000
americans

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
americans
 
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 align:start position:0%
when the within a few weeks this death
 
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
toll is
 
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
will surpass uh a million
 
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
so this that makes it the worst
 
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophe in the u.s history in terms
 
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
of uh loss of life since uh in fact i
 
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
think it's the worst catastrophe even
 
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
worse than the civil war
 
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
the worldwide death toll of 5.8 million
 
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
and counting and it probably won't be
 
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
so the uh can you hear me okay
 
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay good so i can leave my leave my
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
mask on um
 
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a hundred percent the covet the
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
covet vaccines may not be 100 effective
 
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.830 align:start position:0%
covet vaccines may not be 100 effective
100

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
safe but they're very good there's a lot
 
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
we don't know about the virus
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
yet but we do know for sure that it's
 
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily dangerous and there
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
still is no cure for it
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
and of course also because it's a
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
respiratory virus um you know it's being
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
spread through the air you know we're
 
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
all breathing the same air regardless of
 
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
what letter we have after our name or
 
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
whether we're wearing a mask or whether
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're vaccinated or not
 
00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.030 align:start position:0%
we're vaccinated or not
so

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.910 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know so it's extraordinarily
 
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
dangerous and pervasive you know it's
 
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the planet
 
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
so i represent durham the home of unh
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
like other colleges and university
 
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
universities unh has taken a very
 
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
aggressive approach
 
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
to fighting the pandemic
 
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
really even before the state of
 
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
emergency beginning with masking up and
 
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
social distancing continuing with
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
testing for the virus
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
and they're still doing both those
 
00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.070 align:start position:0%
and they're still doing both those
things

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
and then since and when the covet
 
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines became available which was
 
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
almost exactly a year ago unh has done
 
00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
everything its power to make sure that
 
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.429 align:start position:0%
everything its power to make sure that
uh

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
everyone in his close-knit student body
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
as well as the faculty of uh and staff
 
00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
gets gets immunized
 
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
at least as many of them as possible
 
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
if unh was a private school it could
 
00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
have necessarily simply enact a rule
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
requiring everyone on campus who can be
 
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.909 align:start position:0%
requiring everyone on campus who can be
vaccinated

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
to get vaccinated um i know dartmouth
 
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
has instituted a similar role
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
however since unh is a public
 
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
institution is forbidden by rsa 141 c1a
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
from taking that step and this makes no
 
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
from taking that step and this makes no
sense

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
so our other
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
our public college university has the
 
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
same responsibilities as any other
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
institution when it comes to protecting
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
their students and employees from covet
 
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.629 align:start position:0%
their students and employees from covet
19

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
19
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
they should have the right to require
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinations if that is what's needed
 
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
and that um the same
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
the same also goes for um
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
non-educational government institutions
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
as well you know this uh this doesn't
 
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
as well you know this uh this doesn't
just

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know this rsa that i'm trying to
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
take off the books
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't just cover educational
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
institutions it covers like all all
 
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.310 align:start position:0%
institutions it covers like all all
government

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
government agencies and i think all of
 
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
them have the responsibility the rights
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
to do what they can to protect
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
the people their employees their staff
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
and the people who use their services
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
from covet 19 and i i don't think the
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
current law does that so that's uh
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's uh so that that's what that's
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
what my bill does the effective date
 
00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.469 align:start position:0%
what my bill does the effective date
um

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
effective date is not to january 1st
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
2024 but you're certainly if you like
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
the bill i think that's too far in the
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
future you're welcome to move up the
 
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
effective date if you'd like so
 
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
with that i'd be happy to take any
 
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.029 align:start position:0%
with that i'd be happy to take any
questions

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative gay sheriff
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware of the
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
other rule the alternate that unh offers
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
its students
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
that they must be tested frequently if
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
they don't and also are you aware that
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
i mean i not sure the second part of the
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
question i'm not sure exactly what you
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
mean by natural immunity um i mean they
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
they encourage
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
they have a very extensive testing
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
program they've had it i'm going on its
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
third year now that's uh
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
still going on i think they're
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
encouraging even people who have been
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and boosted to continue to
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
get tested continue to mask up to
 
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 align:start position:0%
continue you know
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
continue to deserve other precautions in
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
as i said there's a lot we don't know
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
about it but i think it takes you know
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
there have been cases of people who've
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
caught the disease which i guess you
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
mean the people who've caught the
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
disease and uh survived it um and
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
so they have obviously
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
it's obviously they get immunity from
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
that for a while but the vex i think the
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
vax the vaccines uh provide uh
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
additional additional immunity so um
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know is that what you mean by
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
not quote unquote not respecting natural
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
immunity so
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
like what do you maybe want to clarify
 
00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.390 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
yes natural immunity is the immunity one
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
acquires when when one is
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
is sick and are you aware that the cdc
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
has said they are not aware of anyone
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
who has caught it from someone who
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
i would be i'd be very surprised i guess
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of the cdc saying that i
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
would be very surprised because i think
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
i've heard
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
i've i think i've heard stories of uh
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
exact opposite happening and people
 
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.790 align:start position:0%
exact opposite happening and people
catching

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
catching
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
people uh
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
people can catching covet and then
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
catching it another time in spite of
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
their natural immunity so i know there's
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
definitely been cases of that so i'm
 
00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:45.909 align:start position:0%
definitely been cases of that so i'm
basically

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
but that's true i'm not if they've said
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
it i'm not aware of it and i think i've
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
heard him say the exact opposite but
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
repealing the whole
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
um rsa 141c1 which is the medical
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
freedom immunization
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
thoughts on adding this to
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
the latter part of it which says it
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to nursing homes new
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire state hospital or the medical
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
facility would it be simpler to just add
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
a line in there that says that's
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
unapplied to a state university well in
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
terms of accomplishing that particular
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
goal yes and in fact
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
i was also a co-sponsor of a similar
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill the prime sponsor was
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative of
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
jefferson shapiro who's sitting next to
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
you and um that
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
that one was sent to house education
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
rather than this committee so um and so
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
yes it would be
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
that would have been uh that would have
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
been simpler so that was the first idea
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
that several of us had including
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro had it first and
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
um but i also figured it was worth uh
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
worth doing the same thing for for
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
all government institutions all of which
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
all of which have a responsibility to
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know protect themselves from uh from
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
the virus and i don't think they can do
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
so effectively with the law the way it
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
is but yes it would be simpler um
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not you'd want to amend it
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
that way if there's already an identical
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
bill in education that's a question
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
you'd have to ask the clerk but and
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
yourselves but representative merchant
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
may absolutely be simpler yes thank you
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman also thank you
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
by inserting it here it does not
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
preclude a university for men requiring
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
it just means it's not required by the
 
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:34.710 align:start position:0%
it just means it's not required by the
law

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
so therefore it still allows the
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
flexibility for them like other private
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
institutions or private and
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
business people to
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
apply it if they want to it's just that
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're not required
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
well if you had that other bill and um
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
which is in in education had a hearing i
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
think last week so um
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
yes that would that'd be another way to
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
approach the problem and in fact that's
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
already been considered by a different
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.150 align:start position:0%
committee and
probably

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.190 align:start position:0%
probably
um

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know why the deputy speaker
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
sent that bill to education instead of
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
here but that was what happened so
 
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.829 align:start position:0%
here but that was what happened so
thanks

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
chairman careful
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
um i'm prepping for wednesday
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
i hope you're not here
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'm all set uh so the question is
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh i'm reading uh rsa141-c1a
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and it starts out every person has
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
the natural essential and an inherent
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
right to bodily integrity
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
what's your opinion of bodily integrity
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
well that's uh that's the phrase we
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
interpreted in lots of ways it was even
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh used in a
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
pro reproductive choice constitutional
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
amendment last year which i'm which was
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
probably uh
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
which is probably not the intent of uh
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
of this spill but certainly
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know the virus the virus is also a
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
threat to our body is a threat to my
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
bodily integrities i've certainly felt
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
like my bodily integrity has been
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
threatened every day for you know the
 
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
threatened every day for you know the
past

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
two plus years so um
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think yeah we there is a
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
inherent right to bodily integrity i'm
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
not not sure uh not sure whether
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
immunizations threaten that bodily
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
integrity seems to me the
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
seems to me a respiratory global
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
respiratory pandemic is is a pretty
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
great threat to all of our bodily
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
integrity even though
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
some some some people not necessarily
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
those in the room but some people
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
outside room seem to be in a pretty
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
i guess he wants
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer a follow-up if
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
you want to give him one mr chair
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
would you like a follow-up you may have
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.829 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
would you also agree that there's
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
protecting our
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
our bodily integrity that immunization
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
is one way of doing that
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
oh well i suppose i guess i wouldn't
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
disagree with that the way you stated no
 
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.590 align:start position:0%
disagree with that the way you stated no
so

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
taking my question if um if this bill
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
would any
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
would this require any
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
body to be vaccinated or would it
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
would it allow
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
institutions like
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
like the public universities you're
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.790 align:start position:0%
talking about
um

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
to require it in the future should it be
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
necessary uh well wouldn't
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't directly require anyone to
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated there may be cases where
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
that becomes difficult for someone to go
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and certainly um
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
like i've um the you know i know i i
 
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.069 align:start position:0%
like i've um the you know i know i i
checked

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
checked
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
like i checked just for example
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
dartmouth's policy and they do allow you
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
to apply for an exemption and uh so that
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
would probably that would probably be
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
what the educational institutions would
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh would would implement um
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
and of course a lot of cases you're not
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
you're free to leave that institution or
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
not deal with it or certainly in terms
 
00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:37.509 align:start position:0%
not deal with it or certainly in terms
of

00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
public-facing government institutions
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
they usually have alternate ways of
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
accessing their services um
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
including something simple as you know
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
masking up when you go there or
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
accessing the services remotely so i
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't think um you know
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think any i don't think uh i
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't think any government institution
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
education otherwise is going to be able
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
to totally shut out people who you know
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
chosen not to get vaccinated or
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
 
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.389 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
you

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes lisa
 
00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:25.750 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes lisa
lipkin

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
who wants three minutes she has written
 
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.189 align:start position:0%
who wants three minutes she has written
testimony

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
and she opposes the bill if you would
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
pass out your written testimony
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
okay then you can give the copy to the
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
clerk afterwards
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:43.189 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for offering
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for public comment um
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i didn't come
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
armed with many many facts of figures
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
and data so i wasn't planning to speak
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
about that but i will say that the claim
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
that covet 19 is the worst health crisis
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
of our time or any time it has very very
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
questionable data underpinning that and
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to offer that i could
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
do some research and provide the data
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
that to back up that statement um after
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
today uh what i did come to speak about
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
was in um opposition of bill 1481
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
um i'd also like to quote from the
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
statute which it's seeking to repeal hb
 
00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:25.990 align:start position:0%
statute which it's seeking to repeal hb
220.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
220.
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
that every person has the natural
 
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:29.829 align:start position:0%
that every person has the natural
essential

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
essential
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
and inherent right to bodily integrity
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
which i think is not hard to question to
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
understand what bodily integrity is
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
free from any threat or compulsion
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
any threat or compulsion by government
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
i will note
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
that every single elected representative
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
including each one of you took an oath
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
when you assumed your role as
 
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.829 align:start position:0%
when you assumed your role as
representative

00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
for the people
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
you said i do solemnly swear i will bear
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
faith and true allegiance to the united
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:14.710 align:start position:0%
know you probably know these words by
heart

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
heart
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
that means each of you has personally
 
00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:17.990 align:start position:0%
that means each of you has personally
sworn

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
so help you god
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
to uphold the constitution of this state
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution states in
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
its very first article all men
 
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.829 align:start position:0%
its very first article all men
people

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
are born equal
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
equally free and independent
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
therefore all government of right
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
originates from the people is founded in
 
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.749 align:start position:0%
originates from the people is founded in
consent

00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
and instituted for general good
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
a person who is coerced
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
into taking an injection or a medical
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
procedure of any kind especially this
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
one which has very questionable positive
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
benefits and a lot of science to support
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
that it is very harmful
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
but a person who is coerced into taking
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
any injection
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
against their will is by definition not
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
in consent
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
and those in government who would do
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
that coercion are acting in direct
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
violation of their oath of office the
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
right to bodily autonomy is an
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
inalienable right it should be an
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
embarrassment forgive me please it
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
should be an embarrassment to this body
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
to have this bill put before the public
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
there is nothing more fundamental to a
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
free people than the freedom to choose
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
what goes into their bodies
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
attempting to remove that rightful
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
freedom is inhumane
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
immoral and definitely unconstitutional
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
in upholding your oath of office i will
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
look forward to seeing each of you
 
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.350 align:start position:0%
look forward to seeing each of you
reject

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
reject
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%

00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%

00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
for um taking my question i
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts about um
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
other state governments um instituting
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
mandates and coercing people have you
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
been aware of of that occurring anywhere
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
else sure i mean i'm aware of the
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
attempts to do it i think it's been shot
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
down quite a bit
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
um i just i mean it follows the same i
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
can't even believe that in our time that
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
we are actually questioning whether a
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
person has the right to decide what goes
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
in their bodies period i don't even
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
think i can't believe anywhere in this
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
country we could even be debating that
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
especially when there is actual science
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
and there are there are people who have
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
been greatly harmed by this vaccine that
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
are desperately trying to speak out and
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
get notice and be uh respected for the
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
true harms that have been done to them
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know crazy to me
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of focus on rights which i
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
totally support
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
at the same time this also comes with
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
rights as responsibilities
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
so can you speak to help me understand
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
the issue about responsibilities if
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
someone likes not to take the vaccine
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
which is their right
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
sure however they're also responsibility
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
to protect those around them
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
by either wearing a mask or mitigating
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
the transmission of that disease can you
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
speak to the responsibility side of that
 
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.110 align:start position:0%
speak to the responsibility side of that
equation

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
equation
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
sure and i think representative king
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
kind of touched on that when he said
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
what are the ways that a person may be
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
able to protect themselves so certainly
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
anyone that feels comfortable and feels
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
better about
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
being vaccinated should have the right
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
and freedom to do that so
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
the premise of a vaccine is that it
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
protects the person who's vaccinated so
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
to me that would be the primary
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
protection if somebody was of that
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
mindset and wanted to do that i'm
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
certainly again a mask you know again a
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
lot of there's a lot of questionable
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
science behind a lot of what is going on
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
but um people are free to wear masks
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
people are free to
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
stay away from each other there's all
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that one can do to
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
protect oneself if one is feeling
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
threatened but but it's almost like you
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
know there's that expression um
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh your
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
rights don't end at the beginning of my
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
fear or something like that you know
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's that like just because you're
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
afraid doesn't mean you can infringe on
 
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
afraid doesn't mean you can infringe on
my

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
right to breathe freely to trust in my
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
immune system there's so much there are
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
actually a very large amount of natural
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
remedies that people can take to
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
strengthen their immune system to stay
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
well and then should anybody
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
get sick there are um excellent remedies
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
that do not involve hospitals or
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
injections where they can be healthy so
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
there's it's a much bigger story i think
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
than just the the narrow cast that this
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
is dangerous and we need to protect
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves at all costs no matter what
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
the danger might be in the protection
 
00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:11.270 align:start position:0%
the danger might be in the protection
in

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
speaking to the question about
 
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.430 align:start position:0%
speaking to the question about
rights

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh and responsibilities
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
your answer was mostly about your rights
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
i was looking in my bag to see if i had
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
a copy of the new hampshire constitution
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
i with me i don't
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
but early on it talks about how in
 
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.110 align:start position:0%
but early on it talks about how in
society

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
society
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
in order to gain some rights
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
which we get when we live in society we
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
have to give up some rights
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
so that is where the rights of other
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
people besides ourselves start to kick
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
in well again i don't think anybody
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
would want to infringe on anyone else's
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
right to protect themselves you know i'm
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
not saying uh nobody should be masked
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
and nobody should be vaccinated and i
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
have the right to impose that on anyone
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'm saying everyone has the right to
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
their own sense their own bodily sense
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
and even when it's based in science
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
supporting their
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
sense and their common sense um to
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
handle their health however they feel
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
so you know it gets very uh murky there
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
when you start putting other people as
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for your responsibility for
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
your own health i'm taking
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility for my health you have a
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
right to take responsibility for your
 
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.870 align:start position:0%
right to take responsibility for your
health

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative canuck
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh given the fact that one of those very
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
important parts of vaccination is not
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
just protection of the person who's
 
00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:35.750 align:start position:0%
just protection of the person who's
vaccinated

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
but protection of others around them
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that some people are
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
vulnerable uh may
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
not have a good immune system that
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
allows that gives them a good response
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
when they are vaccinated or may be
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
medically unable to be vaccinated or
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
to remember actually none of our
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines are 100 effective that one of
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
the most important parts of high levels
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
of vaccination are protection of others
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
in society not just protection of the
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
person who's vaccinated
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
and i have i just happen to have that
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
what our chair was looking for
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
you quoted the constitution a lot but
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
part one article three says when men
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
enter into a state of society they
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
surrender up some of their natural
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
rights to that society in order to
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
ensure the protection of others so given
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
that a high vaccination rate is
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
protective and we have that in the
 
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.950 align:start position:0%
protective and we have that in the
constitution

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
why is this not acceptable to
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
enforce vaccine mandates if necessary to
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
protect others
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
well again i think there are a few
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
issues in what you said um
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
it the cdc itself has told us that the
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine is does not stop spread and does
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
not stop
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
actually getting sick so so again there
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
we could be having a whole conversation
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
about the actual science of this
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
particular vaccine but i didn't come
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak about that um so you
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
know does one give up rights in order to
 
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.830 align:start position:0%
know does one give up rights in order to
be

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
um you know a citizen that works in in
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
beneficial ways with others
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
um that again would be something i'd
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
have to look at i mean what is you know
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
a right
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know you're talking about the the
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
right for someone to impose a medical
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
invention intervention on someone else
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
without their full without their consent
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
with other true consent i mean that gets
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
into nuremberg issues so i don't think
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
we can talk we can sort of make it sound
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
like yeah well i don't you know i don't
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
have the right to throw my garbage on
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
the street because that isn't polite and
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
it makes a dirty street and it's not
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
good for others but you're saying you
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
know when there are when it is possible
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
for one to protect oneself as i said
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
before have remedies there's all kinds
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
of ways to not be at risk
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
by my actions you personally do not have
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be in any risk based on my
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
health choices that's just a fact so so
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
we you know
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
then it goes all the way into this again
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
about bodily bodily autonomy integrity
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
there's a risk if there is a risk and it
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
is known that there are risks and it's
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
been proven that there are risks because
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
people have been greatly harmed by this
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine if there's a risk there must be
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
genuine full sovereign consent
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.350 align:start position:0%
taking my question
so

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
of the mind that
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
our bodies and what we put in them and
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
all of the things that we're dealing
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
with right now for rights are natural
 
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.149 align:start position:0%
with right now for rights are natural
rights

00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
um in here in article four
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
among the natural rights some are in
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
their very nature unalienable do you
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
those rights are unalienable i
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely do right because no
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
equivalent can be given or received for
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
them of this kind are the rights of
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
conscience so
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
i hear you saying
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
that you're thinking that that our
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
rights are rights of conscience am i
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
correct in my assumptions yes and bodily
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
integrity yes and the right to research
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
and study and discover for ourselves and
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
use critical thinking and and talk to
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
these 25 doctors and put their testimony
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
next to these 25 doctors and decide for
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves so yes conscience for our own
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
very lives
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
my question have you found it extremely
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
difficult in the regular media to find
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
contradictory information or has it been
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much one-sided and leaving those
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
of us who disagree pretty much out in
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
the cold i could have said that verbatim
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely extraordinarily one-sided
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
and not only one-sided but doctors
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
doctors with
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
nobel prize backgrounds and triple board
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
certified and highly regarded and
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
respected prior to 2020
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
are censored
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
being censored
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
and trying to speak out so yes very
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
one-sided and and
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
frightening rather actually for those of
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
us that have other that are are studying
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
this in a more objective way
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony appreciate
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
your coming very much chair recognizes
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
i am a vaccine injured individual not
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
from the coven 19 vaccine however
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
i did suffer a vaccine injury so i'm
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
here to tell you that they happen
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
first of all second of all the bottom
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
line is what is happening right now is a
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
division and an isolation
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
so the unvaccinated are being identified
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
as dangerous the vaccinated are being
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
identified as fearful
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
and that's being perpetrated on us by
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
our government and our mainstream mostly
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
our main street meter but i think it's
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
all really connected if we go back five
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
years ago who in this room could
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
honestly say that they believe that big
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies really had our
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
best interests at heart
 
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.230 align:start position:0%
best interests at heart
anyone

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
if we go back five years ago
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
would we believe
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
that when someone knocked on the door
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
and said i'm here from the government
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to help would we have
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
believed you
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
would anyone in this room have believed
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
what we're being told
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
we believed in our doctors
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
over time we've lost that trust and i
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
think it's been perpetrated on the
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
american people by
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
some of our doctors who either have
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
bought into the propaganda of only one
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
side and i'm not saying that both sides
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
aren't full of propaganda i don't know
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
because i'm not being
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to use my critical thinking
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
skills and really identify
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
what is the truth
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years we've been
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about it's my truth
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
just because you my truth doesn't mean
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's truth
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
and that's something that we all have to
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
take into account now i just wanted to
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
say like i have
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
um excerpts from a confidential briefing
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
to congress of 7 29 22
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
that talks about the vaccine and
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
of 469 cases in one county in
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where 79 percent were
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
symptomatic and breakthrough cases from
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
the vaccine to me that doesn't sound
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
like something that is
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's questionable um
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
the cdc estimates if i can't say it um
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
maybe 75 to 85 effective 75 to 85
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
percent against a new variant rather
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
than 94
 
00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:16.950 align:start position:0%
than 94
5

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
5
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
against the original so i mean you can
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
find the information but it's not easy
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
i have from the cdc website itself i
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
have two pages of
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
some of the side effects from these
 
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.269 align:start position:0%
some of the side effects from these
vaccines

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the witness to hold up
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
for a minute you're a frequent flyer and
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
we give you frequent flyer points for it
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you but we know your testimony
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay and we have other things to do okay
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
so so i appreciate you coming and could
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
you i'll give you two minutes to two
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
whole minutes less than two minutes i
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
promise or fewer okay okay um so as a as
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
a uh i just wanted to speak a little bit
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
as a vaccine-injured individual do i
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
feel i'm being discriminated against
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
right now yes because when i walk around
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
without a mask i'm looked at funny when
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
i put a mask on i have reactions
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of um skin reactions now
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
since my vaccine injury so i'm in a
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
position where yes i'm being
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
discriminated against because i'm looked
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
at as
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
something other than
 
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.070 align:start position:0%
something other than
appropriate

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
however at the same time i choose
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes because of my immune
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
deficiency issues i choose to allow
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
myself to be discriminated against
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
on purpose i can make the choice as an
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated person i can make the
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
choice to not put myself
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
at the super bowl
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
i can make the choice not to put myself
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
in the vi in an environment where people
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
are coughing and sneezing and and i may
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
be at risk i can choose not to put
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
myself in a hospital emergency room
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
where there are a lot of chance of me
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
becoming infected with not only the
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
coven 19 vaccine cover nitin virus but
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
any other virus or illness that's
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
transferable common flu
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
so that being said i just wanted to say
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
from someone who was vaccine injured
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
our rights are our rights they shouldn't
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
be trampled on and um
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
and we can choose
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
as our individuals
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
how to protect ourselves and others
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'll take care of that thank you that
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's not your responsibility to do that
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative soloway um just a quick
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
question ms chester thank you mr
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
question but i uh always need to rely on
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
people who give testimony for the
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
accuracy of their facts you identified a
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
document that you quoted and you dated
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
it 7 29 22 21 can i look oh i was
 
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the publication of
 
00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the publication of
that

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
i did that last time i did that before
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
too thank you thank you good good good
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and with that no more
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
pink cards i'm closing the hearing on
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
which means
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.870 align:start position:0%
we can do
some

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.430 align:start position:0%
some
executing

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
executing
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll start with the one that i think
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
will be real easy for us so i'm opening
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
an executive session
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1320 an act relative to
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
public exposure of deceased human bodies
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
and your
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
tell us what you'd like us to know this
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
is an exact session it does not have to
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
just to review for people because there
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
still is some confusion about
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
the bill itself is simply to repeal the
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
the current statute is a little bit
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
confusing as written no dead human body
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
shall be exposed to the public for a
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
period in excess of 24 hours and a said
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
body is properly embalmed
 
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.710 align:start position:0%
body is properly embalmed
um

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
it is actually confusing enough that i
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
was surprised that one of the funeral
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
directors actually misstated its meaning
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
in their uh in their testimony
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to i'm sorry i wasn't
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
quite ready to state it but well
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
whatever one of them actually even
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
misstated it saying it was if it's more
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
than 24 hours before it's exposed and
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
that is not of course what it says
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
now the important part of what this is
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
is simply giving to the consumer
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i guess the consumer
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
is the family but the consumer being the
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
deceased person who may have made their
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
arrangements prior to becoming deceased
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
the choice of what they want to do as to
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
whether they wish to become embalmed or
 
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.950 align:start position:0%
whether they wish to become embalmed or
not

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
and it is not something which is
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
necessary from a public health point of
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
view which is why we heard it here in
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
there was a question brought up by the
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
chair of whether we should have a
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
disclaimer because we saw that there was
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
this confusion and have some kind of a
 
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.910 align:start position:0%
this confusion and have some kind of a
form

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
this was generated partly by his
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
discussion with the funeral director he
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
knows he asked us to reach out i
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
disagreed for reasons i'll say in a
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
moment and i reached out to the funeral
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
advocacy people representative woods
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
reached out to the funeral director but
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
the things that came back from them were
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
vastly different and this was going to
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
totally cut out the
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
the organization of funeral directors
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
from any of the crafting of any
 
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.990 align:start position:0%
from any of the crafting of any
disclaimer

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
disclaimer
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
my concern is that that really would
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
massively expand the scope of the bill
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
we were we were hearing a bill that had
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
public health implications making a
 
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.230 align:start position:0%
public health implications making a
decision

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
if we put in a form that has to be
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
mandated then we're actually tampering
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
in commerce and regulating that that
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
industry which is the purview of
 
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.589 align:start position:0%
industry which is the purview of
commerce

00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee not us that's not our
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
specialty and they might not be happy
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
with that and i would think it's also
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
disrespectful of the funeral directors
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
who would not have had a chance to
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
comment about that since that was not
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
what the bill was about the chair agrees
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so yes yeah we
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
had some conversations so we kind of
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
agreed that at the end of the day we
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
should not expand it a good option maybe
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
for another year and just keep it simple
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
again the reason for the repeal is
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
simply to give people a choice that it's
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
not presented in a misleading fashion
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
the statute only guides the rules and
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
regulations it allows the
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
funeral directors to
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
do whatever they want they may say we
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
offer like there's ads in our paper
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes about we offer cremation they
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
could say we offer refrigeration if you
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
want to not be embalmed and have a green
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
burial we offer refrigeration and you
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
can have a viewing you can even have a
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
viewing without
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh preservation or with refrigeration
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
just for a few days till you get there
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
that viewing probably ought to be done
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
fairly soon if you do that but the point
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
is these are choices
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
that the consumer works out with the
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
funeral home
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
and the funeral home can set their own
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
policies this doesn't tell them what
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
they have to do it doesn't preclude them
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
from embalming
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
and so they set their policies and the
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
consumer can choose which funeral home
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
they wish to go to so that's really what
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's all about uh do you want me to make
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
i should have made that first perhaps
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
well the chair actually has your name
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
down thinking about what your motion
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
might be so go ahead and i would just
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
move a simple otp
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the chair will second that
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
now we can discuss further
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm still puzzled because of the
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
simplicity of the wording here
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
i wish it said that the
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
funeral directors
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
have a right
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
to do whatever they want to offer
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
whatever services they want which i'm
 
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.990 align:start position:0%
whatever services they want which i'm
told

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
told
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
is true
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
but i don't see it here
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
and the my own director the
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
person i know the most who is a funeral
 
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.470 align:start position:0%
person i know the most who is a funeral
director

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
is quite concerned
 
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.550 align:start position:0%
is quite concerned
because

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
she didn't see that protection in there
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative connect on a follow-up
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
then representative weber yes if it is
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
not prohibited by statute
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
that is a right that they have
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
um we also
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
don't i mean we would have to a pretty
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
big set of rsas if we had to tell
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
everybody what they could do
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
so the issue is if it is prohibited in a
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
statute you can't do it if it's not
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
prohibited you can so this is they have
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
every right
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
within the limits of what rules are set
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
but that's a different issue
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you i was going to make
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the same point but the the
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
way i always make it is there is no law
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
allowing me to brush my teeth in the
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
morning i do it every day anyway and
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
nobody's prosecuted me yet
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
we appreciate yes
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%

00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%

off-label practice while also making
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
sure that off-label practice doesn't
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
provide cover for bad behavior
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
as we looked to this
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
we realized that the language
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
could have provided that protection
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
because simply because they had
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
prescribed something off label so we
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
agreed upon language to say
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire confirms its
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
strong support for shared
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
decision-making between health care
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
professionals and their patients a
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
licensee may lawfully prescribe an
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
fda-approved drug product for an
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
off-label indication where there is
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
sound scientific medical evidence or
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
when the licensee has provided and
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
documented informed consent for the
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
patient including a disclosure that the
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
prescription is for an off-label
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
indication a licensee shall be held to
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
the same standard of care as when
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
prescribing for on label indications
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
the distinction between the two the
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
sound scientific medical evidence is
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
because there's a
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
huge amount of medicine is done off
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
label the cost of approval is just
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
astronomical and we don't want to
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
cheapen the informed consent when it's
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
something that is such routine care that
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
it just you just become blind to the
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
paperwork whenever there's debate or
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
discussion then it is appropriate to
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
obtain that informed written consent
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's a practice that i'd like to see
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
more of in general so i'm happy to see
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
this here
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
then also that puts it under the nurse
 
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.270 align:start position:0%
then also that puts it under the nurse
practitioners

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
the physicians and surgeons and
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
physicians assistants
 
00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:44.950 align:start position:0%
physicians assistants
and

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
it keeps the same part for the licensed
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacist to say that
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
that they should not face
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary or disciplinary action
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
by the pharmacy board for filling a
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
valid prescription for an off-label use
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
that is within the part that talks about
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
actions so it's the right right section
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
of law because there are other parts
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
that are carved out there so this this
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
provides that protection it provides
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
that clarity and i think that this is a
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
great collaborative effort
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
so thank you for everybody who worked
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
together anyone else in the work group
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
wish to add anything before we throw it
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
open to everyone else representative
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
woods yeah thank you mr chair um i would
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
just add that
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
i was concerned about what the
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
relationship might be with the ama and
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
their code of medical ethics which
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
physicians are required to follow and
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's in statute it's referenced
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
and indeed there were a number of what
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
called the ama has a council on ethical
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
and judicial affairs which uh
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh offers opinions uh and and judgments
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
as well for that matter uh and um i
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
won't go bore you with all the details
 
00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.910 align:start position:0%
won't go bore you with all the details
but

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
the way this is now formulated is very
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with the outlined in the
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
ama's code of mythical medical
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
medical ethics
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
their most recent uh
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
opinions uh in
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
in in the pandemic as it's called
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
um so i just to clarify that this is i
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
the way excuse me the way this was
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
worded now that fits and will protect
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
not only the physicians but also the
 
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.109 align:start position:0%
not only the physicians but also the
patients

00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else from the work group
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
with a comment
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else representative shapiro
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
i looked up the numbers the original
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
bill 79 supported this bill and 20 were
 
00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:48.309 align:start position:0%
bill 79 supported this bill and 20 were
opposed

00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
i think this is a great collaboration
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
and a good solution this is just a kind
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
of a grammatical a question
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
where there is sound scientific medical
 
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.030 align:start position:0%
where there is sound scientific medical
evidence

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really say evidence of what
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
actually i'll defer to representative
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
burch representative merchant
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
the reference to that is sound medical
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
evidence to use it off label
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of times in which to
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
represent leon's
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
comment it's very expensive for a drug
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
company or somebody to go back to the
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
fda to get an approval for a particular
 
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.630 align:start position:0%
fda to get an approval for a particular
indication

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
indication
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's cost prohibitive but
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
there's many times in which drugs are
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
used off label in their studies to
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
document the use of it through the sound
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
medical evidence which is what that
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't want to beat a dead horse
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
so this will be my last comment that was
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
the previous exact session
 
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.950 align:start position:0%
the previous exact session
um

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.309 align:start position:0%
um
right

00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
but are we talking about evidence of
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
efficacy are we talking about evidence
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
of safety
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what evidence of
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
off-label use would be exactly it's um
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's not explicit to what you're asking
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
for it's implied that the sound medical
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
evidence is for the off-label use of it
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
it goes back to the efficacy of it as
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
well as the safety of it because the fda
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
looks at both things a drug has to be
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
both safe and efficacious so this is
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
basically saying to the prescriber that
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
you have to have some sound medical
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
evidence to support the safety side as
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
well as the efficacy side
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify one thing is my
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
major concern with the initial bill was
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
the prohibition against
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
any action by the medical board of
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
course it was limited at that point to
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
only that this one is much better to
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
have the various practitioners covered
 
00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:50.390 align:start position:0%
have the various practitioners covered
um

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
what it appears is that in the section
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
on pharmacists there is an explicit
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
statement about the fact that a
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
pharmacist shall not face
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary interdisciplinary
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
action revealing it filling a valid
 
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.910 align:start position:0%
action revealing it filling a valid
prescription

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's good and i think the point is
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
since there's no prohibition in the
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
other sections for the boards to be able
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
to take action if somebody doesn't
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
follow good informed consent or if it's
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
something which there's no medical
 
00:50:17.359 --> 00:50:18.309 align:start position:0%
something which there's no medical
evidence

00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
that would still be allowed is that's my
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation is that what you're
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
could you condense down exactly what
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
that question was so in other words if a
 
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
that question was so in other words if a
practitioner

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
still did something that was really off
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
the wall there was no evidence
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
whatsoever for what they prescribed or
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
for which they
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
or they didn't get informed consent they
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
could still be disciplined by the board
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
i presume since this doesn't
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit that
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that that's my understanding good if
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
there's either that evidence or if there
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
is that informed consent that makes it
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
valid because otherwise it wouldn't be
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
valid right thank you representative
 
00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.030 align:start position:0%
valid right thank you representative
weber

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up the last sentence in
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
the section on physicians and surgeons
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
says a licensee shall be held to the
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
same standard of care
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
as when prescribing on label
 
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.109 align:start position:0%
as when prescribing on label
so

00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
they need to be satisfied that they can
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
not only that they know what they're
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
doing but that they can satisfy their
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
board and if i may just as a matter of
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman i will say that
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
when my late husband
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
was being treated for the prostate
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
cancer that was very advanced when it
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
was found
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
he was
 
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:38.950 align:start position:0%
he was
when

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
there were no other interventions that
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
were available that he would accept
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
he was offered an experimental treatment
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
that he was told explicitly was a breast
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
cancer drug
 
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.190 align:start position:0%
cancer drug
that

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
might aid in pain control and might
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
prevent his bones from becoming brittle
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
and breaking
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
and he consented knowingly to that
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
because the side effects were very
 
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.190 align:start position:0%
because the side effects were very
limited

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
limited
 
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.470 align:start position:0%
limited
and

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
after he had been on that drug for a
 
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.430 align:start position:0%
after he had been on that drug for a
year

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
the doctor asked him well you've been on
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
it for a year what do you want to do and
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
he said
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know what other people do and he
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
said nobody's been on it this long and
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
at that time when he started he was the
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
only person
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
receiving that treatment and you know
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
you had to wait for it to come up from
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy and everything else
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
at the end of a year they were treating
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
a number
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
of similar patients with that medication
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
because they were finding
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
that not only did it aid indeed in pain
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
control and
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
not allowing brittle bones to break but
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
that the people who were receiving it
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
were doing better than anybody thought
 
00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.430 align:start position:0%
were doing better than anybody thought
they

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
might and so without understanding the
 
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.910 align:start position:0%
might and so without understanding the
mechanism

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
they were documenting over time
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
the scientific knowledge that
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
this has helped a lot of people
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
with very little
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
downside risk
 
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.430 align:start position:0%
downside risk
so

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's how science moves on and and i am
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
exceedingly grateful to it and uh
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
because we had four years that he
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had otherwise
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
and um also i'm very grateful for the
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
work on this bill because it looks like
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's a very good balance and i thank
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
everybody who is involved
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh just to again to clarify
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
what this actually means when we're
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
saying that they're held to the same
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
standard i'll read just that one
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
sentence from the ama guide which is
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
what's required
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
by statute uh in opinion 9.6.6
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
prescribing and dispensing drugs and and
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%

speak slowly
[Laughter]

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
this this was the bill to say that the
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
could not require a vaccine passport
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
in order for
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
the person in question to receive any of
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
the benefits that they might receive
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
administered by the department of health
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you may remember that there was
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that the department felt that
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
the existing language
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
in the statute already
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
required that
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
but that perhaps it was not as clear as
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
it might be
 
01:00:51.839 --> 01:00:52.950 align:start position:0%
it might be
so

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.549 align:start position:0%
so
on

01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
sort of the min do do the least that
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be done to make it clear
 
01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.990 align:start position:0%
needs to be done to make it clear
principle

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
principle
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that the issue is not so
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
much the vaccine passport as requiring
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
the vaccine itself because that's what
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
people don't want
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
if they don't want it and that is fair
 
01:01:13.599 --> 01:01:15.510 align:start position:0%
if they don't want it and that is fair
enough

01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.390 align:start position:0%
enough
so

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
the existing statute already says no
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
person may be compelled to receive an
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
immunization for covid19 in order to
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
secure receiver access any public
 
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.470 align:start position:0%
secure receiver access any public
facility

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
any public benefit or any public service
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
the department already believed they
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
were covered by that but in order to
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
make it absolutely clear to everybody
 
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.990 align:start position:0%
make it absolutely clear to everybody
else

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
what i did was i simply inserted after
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
i changed the language to the new
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of health and human
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
services comma
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
or any political subdivision of the
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:57.910 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
in

01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the new language including but
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
not limited to county cities towns
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
precincts water districts school
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
districts school administrative units or
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
quasi-public entities but that was all
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
language that was there so we don't need
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
to parse that
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
so my thought was that this made it
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
crystal clear
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
that if you are applying for food stamps
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
or one of the other benefits you you
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
you get that benefit if you qualify for
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
it without
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
and if i would
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
move the adoption of the amendment if
 
01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:35.910 align:start position:0%
move the adoption of the amendment if
it's

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
moves the adoption of the amendment
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
second to representative soloway
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
when i when i was looking at this
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
you've left off that
 
01:03:05.359 --> 01:03:06.150 align:start position:0%
you've left off that
first

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
out of the amendment which says
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
communicable disease medical freedom and
 
01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.549 align:start position:0%
communicable disease medical freedom and
immunization

01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
immunization
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports prohibited
 
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.230 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports prohibited
that

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.190 align:start position:0%
that
is

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
was not directed just at covid 19
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what people are
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
looking for is that when the next
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
infectious disease comes around
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
if we don't have that line in there all
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
of a sudden vaccine passports could be
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
required where this prevents
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
um vaccine passports
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
in general and if there's such a need
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
for it they can bring it before the
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislature at that point
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to get one madam clerk the
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
original bill as representative teroshan
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
filed it limited it to covet 19 line 5
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
of his original bill so the amendment
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
does not change anything
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
and they're the same language that's the
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
existing language in the existing
 
01:04:11.359 --> 01:04:12.630 align:start position:0%
existing language in the existing
statute

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
in both cases it stays
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
that language stays the same
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
because in the original bill
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
all the bits that are not
 
01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.549 align:start position:0%
all the bits that are not
bolded

01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
bolded
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's the original this is the
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
amendment it doesn't change it but this
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
line right here okay
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
so you're addressing your question
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
to the header
 
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:43.990 align:start position:0%
to the header
which

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the original bill line one includes
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
the word vaccine passports prohibited
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
but in the amendment in line seven it
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
does not
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
but it does include medical freedom in
 
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
but it does include medical freedom in
immunizations

01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.630 align:start position:0%
immunizations
broadly

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
broadly
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
so if you're not immunized you would not
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
my concern is that
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
everything is great about the amendment
 
01:05:20.799 --> 01:05:21.829 align:start position:0%
everything is great about the amendment
except

01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
except
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mention
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
not requiring a vaccine passport or
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
proof of vaccination whatever choice of
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
words it just doesn't say
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
that the department of health and human
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
services shall not require a vaccine
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
passport as a condition of eligibility
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
for our access to department programs
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
benefits or services representative
 
01:05:44.799 --> 01:05:46.069 align:start position:0%
benefits or services representative
weber

01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
weber
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
but the point is
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
that what people are objecting to is
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
being subject to a vaccine that they
 
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.589 align:start position:0%
being subject to a vaccine that they
don't

01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
want to put in their bodies
 
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
this acknowledges that they do not
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
have to put the vaccine in their bodies
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
in order to get the benefits
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
so there is no need for passports or
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
anything else because
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
whether you have the vaccine or whether
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have the vaccine you are
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
equally qualified to have benefits so
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
the fact the passport part of it becomes
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
irrelevant the important thing is that
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
you cannot be compelled
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
to accept a medical treatment that you
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
don't want in order to get the benefits
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
that you qualify for in it
 
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
that you qualify for in it
completely

01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
making clear that
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and unvaccinated people all
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
qualify for benefits and
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination status is irrelevant to
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
whether they qualify or not
 
01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:04.549 align:start position:0%
whether they qualify or not
representative

01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
oh there we are it was flashing green
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
not red okay um yeah in fact i think the
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
current language of the stat of the
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendment is far clearer because
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise the original language was did
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
have vaccine passport what if they said
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
we have to be vaccinated but you don't
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
need a vaccine passport then we haven't
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
achieved what is really being desired
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
and as representative weber says the
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
objection is to being vaccinated whether
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's a piece of paper or not and
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports at this point are not
 
01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:28.870 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports at this point are not
even

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
any entity that we have in existence so
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
i think the amendment is a cleaner way
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
while it may be a cleaner way to do it
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
i already would read the department of
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
health and human services of being a
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
political subdivision
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
just as which which is already included
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
in existing law just as the universities
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
who have been having students show a
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
phone saying about their testing status
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
their vaccination status
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
so there is a value to clarifying that
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports are not accepted
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
it is something that is absolutely
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
moving not forward here in new hampshire
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
but in other places we are seeing these
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
standardized documentations and it's our
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
job to hold that line
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
when we look to the constitution in
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
article three of part one we've been
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
talking up until the semicolon but we
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
haven't included the last
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
those read and without such an
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
equivalent the surrender is void
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
so the entire statement is when men
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
enter into a state of society they
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
surrender up some of their natural
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
rights to that society in order to
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
ensure the protection of others and
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
without such an equivalent the surrender
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
is void
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
when we look at it now we we still are
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
seeing people who are catching covid
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
from people who've been vaccinated
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
because it's not a perfect vaccine if we
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
had a perfect vaccine i don't think that
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
there would be a debate about it because
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
people would be going out and getting it
 
01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.070 align:start position:0%
people would be going out and getting it
but

01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
right now it does not ensure the
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
protection of others
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
so the constitutional arguments i think
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
there go out the window but we have the
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
i really believe that we do need to move
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
this forward by keeping that language
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
about the vaccine passport for these
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
services especially because so many of
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
the services from dhhs aren't
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily the medical ones but all of
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
those other ones when you're already
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with vulnerable people who
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
some of them are there because they they
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
have trouble asserting their consent in
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
the first place because other people
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
have taken advantage of them and they're
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
being protected by the department and
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
they need to know that the state and the
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
department do
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
do reflect and do
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
yields to representative weber
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
but this bill is not about one's right
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
to consent it's about one's right to
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
yes and it's about what may or may not
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
be required to receive that benefit when
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with people who
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
some already have a distrust of the
 
01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
some already have a distrust of the
government

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
or when we're dealing with people who
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
trust absolutely everything the
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
government says and they would have gone
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
badly in previous times in history we
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
have to look at the fact that some
 
01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.430 align:start position:0%
have to look at the fact that some
people

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
some people will feel coerced to have a
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
document if it's available
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's in the statutes and
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not their right is already
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
protected as it already is in the
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
get a vaccine card
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
until i got my first shot
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
right and if i drew through the drove
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
through that line and they said you want
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
a vaccine and they said nah
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have given me a card
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
so to me the vaccine passport
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
is a moot point for those who aren't
 
01:11:09.199 --> 01:11:10.070 align:start position:0%
is a moot point for those who aren't
getting

01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
vaccinated by their choice now
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
response representative weber
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
well i agree with that but i'm also
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
going to point out because the
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
university system was mentioned
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
as the men as hb 1099 was drafted
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment applies only to the
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply to anybody else
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
so and it's only for the purpose of
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits
 
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.350 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits
and

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
does exactly the same thing by making it
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
clear that you do not have to have a
 
01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
clear that you do not have to have a
vaccine

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
for anybody to
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
give your benefits i don't know why
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
anybody would ask in that case because
 
01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.990 align:start position:0%
anybody would ask in that case because
unlike

01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
congregate living at a university or
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
medically frail people in a nursing home
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of other ways to
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
deal with the issue of applying for
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
benefits including applying for them
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
online which keep everybody safe which
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
goes back to the mutuality of the
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
surrender of
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
part of the natural rights
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
and it just makes sense that
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.550 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
is completely contained in the amendment
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
there may be other places and other
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
issues where yes more language is needed
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
or more clarification is needed or more
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
balancing of the rights
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
of different people is needed
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
but that's not this this is just to
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
apply for benefits
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's all it's talking about the chair
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
would like to ask representative
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
am i correct
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
in saying
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
that you have taken representative
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
trojan's bill
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
and broadened
 
01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.110 align:start position:0%
and broadened
significantly

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
the freedoms
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
from just the department
 
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.110 align:start position:0%
from just the department
to

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.229 align:start position:0%
to
any

01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
political subdivision of the state of
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire if anything you are
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
taking his bill
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
and making it a broader freedom
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
well i i would actually say that the
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
broader freedoms were already included
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
in the statute that we already have they
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
were already there
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
and this is not an area the
 
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
the benefits from the department of the
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
health health and human services
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
covered by the original statute which is
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
much broader
 
01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.750 align:start position:0%
much broader
but

01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
it's important to make it clear what
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
people's rights are
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
but yes the the provision that has been
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
inserted is a very limited provision
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
which limits a broader um
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
anything else we'll see if we can wrap
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
this up representative soloway
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
there are really two pieces to this
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
one piece says
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
every by the way
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
this is based on the fact that
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately many of the pieces of
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
legislation that we pass
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
are tested in the courts
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
the courts go back to our debate
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
in order to make their decisions that's
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
correct if they take a look at this bill
 
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
at the amendment
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
it begins with every person has the
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
natural essential etc
 
01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.470 align:start position:0%
natural essential etc
to

01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
free from any threat or compulsion by
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
government to accept an immunization
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
stop there
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
that covers us for all immunizations it
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
then speaks to immunization for covid
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
but that is only the particularity of
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
the general principle
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
that people
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
may be free from the compulsion to
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
accept immunization and therefore i
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
believe that this broader freedom
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
can be tested in the courts and will
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
stand scrutiny
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative cushman just
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
quickly two points
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
to representative soloway's
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
point the the new hampshire attorney
 
01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.510 align:start position:0%
point the the new hampshire attorney
general

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.310 align:start position:0%
general
has

01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
interpreted it to only apply to covet 19
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
and my second point is i
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill only serves as a
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
clarifier and i have no problem with
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative weber's amendment i think
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
that it satisfies what the
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor was looking to do
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gay
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
agree that that representative weber's
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
wording is much more compact i am
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're removing in line
 
01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.310 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're removing in line
one

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports prohibited because
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
when we start talking about universities
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
somebody might not pre determine
 
01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.390 align:start position:0%
somebody might not pre determine
that

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.229 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
that the list of any political
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
subdivision thereof including but not
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
limited county cities towns precincts
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
water districts school districts saus or
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
quasi public entities it doesn't say
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
universities there
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
and so either we keep adding
 
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.390 align:start position:0%
and so either we keep adding
exclusions

01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
exclusions
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
or we leave in this general vaccine
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
passports prohibited
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
it is not clear
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
by those other exclusions that it
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
includes universities and i personally
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
am concerned about universities because
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see my granddaughter and
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
grandson have to get more boosters
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman that is existing
 
01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:14.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman that is existing
statute

01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
what you were just reading it's already
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
there so that's already there this bill
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
by the i think it's inadequate
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say universities well that
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's another other time and i believe
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
there's one in labor that
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
provides exemptions for university
 
01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.990 align:start position:0%
provides exemptions for university
students

01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
sounds like representative gay your
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
argument would be with the sponsor of
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
the bill representative teroshan
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
and not with the amendment
 
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.189 align:start position:0%
and not with the amendment
the

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative weber the only thing that
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative corrosion's bill changes
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
is lines eight through eleven and that
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
speaks only to the department of health
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
and human services which does not
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
control the universities the
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
universities is a whole nother question
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
and that certainly
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
can be debated but not here because we
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't deal with the universities
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
unless it's a particular
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
what we have in front of us for the
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
original bill was much more limited
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
because it only spoke to dhhs
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman in the statute as
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
it is universities are not exempted
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
um so public ones public universities
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
are not exempted i know because i've
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
submitted a bill to have them exempted
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
um in another committee but as it stands
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're not exempted so it
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
a vaccine mandate at unh or keene state
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
college would not be allowed under the
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
bill as it is
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to just say that the
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the sign in on the original bill
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
was 600
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%

additional

what was the second one
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
hiv it's uh
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
not intended to argue for or against
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
any of these immunizations
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
personally i believe that the decision
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
to vaccinate one's children should
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately rest with the parents
 
01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.350 align:start position:0%
ultimately rest with the parents
but

01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
if an immunization is to be required we
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
ought to acknowledge the gravity of that
 
01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:43.430 align:start position:0%
ought to acknowledge the gravity of that
decision

01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
by vetting it through the legislative
 
01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:46.709 align:start position:0%
by vetting it through the legislative
process

01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
with all of the scrutiny and
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
transparency that implies
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
in fact this bill does not preclude the
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
possibility of establishing immunization
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
requirements for children in our state
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
beyond those that are already in statute
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
it merely stipulates that decisions of
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
that magnitude
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
should be made by the full legislature
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
the decision to force a vaccine on
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
virtually every child in new hampshire
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
should not be taken lightly
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
under the rulemaking process the
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner has the power to propose a
 
01:35:20.639 --> 01:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
commissioner has the power to propose a
rule

01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
and barring a statutory objection by a
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the jail car the joint
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.629 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
rules

01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
so let me acknowledge
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
a very obvious point i think which is
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
that we would not be discussing this
 
01:35:40.719 --> 01:35:41.669 align:start position:0%
that we would not be discussing this
bill

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
if not for the fact that there are many
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
people around our state
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
around our country and throughout the
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
world who have serious concerns
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
about the covet 19 shots
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
there are multiple reasons for that but
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that people have
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
legitimate questions
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
as to the safety and efficacy of these
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
of of many vaccines but especially the
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
this bill will establish a process that
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
gives doctors and other medical experts
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
ample opportunity to weigh in
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
they do not have that under the current
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
administrative rulemaking process
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
parents and other concerned citizens
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
likewise will have a voice
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the legislative process
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
in these very important decisions
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
the decision to force a vaccination on
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
other citizens has very serious
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
implications that decision should not
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
rest on a single individual or a small
 
01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.149 align:start position:0%
rest on a single individual or a small
group

01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
now i want to address a couple of issues
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
that came up we did receive testimony
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
from dhhs in writing which i'm i know
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
that we'll hear uh we'll hear shortly
 
01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.310 align:start position:0%
that we'll hear uh we'll hear shortly
um

01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns there i think is an
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
implied statement that existing rules
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
existing administrative rules created
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
under this statute
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
141 c20
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
would essentially disappear
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
this bill was written with the
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
understanding and the assumption that
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
they would not
 
01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.189 align:start position:0%
they would not
therefore

01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
um i would
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
just like to put forward this idea that
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
i would be very open to an amendment
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
that would uh preserve the existing
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
until they expire and as as i understand
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
renewal of the of the rules in question
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
were 2016 which means that the
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
legislature would have until 2026
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
um to to make a decision with respect to
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
the three vaccination requirements
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
the other the other concern that i've
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
heard expressed has to do with
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
imminent threats and the department's
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
ability to act quickly
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
in response to public health emergency
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i and i would bring up two points in
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
response to this the first is that
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
we have experienced and many would argue
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
are still experiencing a public health
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
emergency in the form of the covet 19
 
01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.750 align:start position:0%
emergency in the form of the covet 19
pandemic

01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
that still has not resulted in
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
a vaccine mandate for school children in
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i am glad that it has not
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that the more we learn about
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
the uh potential side effects of of the
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
covet shots i think the wiser that
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
decision will prove to be
 
01:38:38.159 --> 01:38:39.590 align:start position:0%
decision will prove to be
nevertheless

01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
um

01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
in what is
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
probably the the worst pandemic or the
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
worst public health emergency of our
 
01:38:47.119 --> 01:38:49.189 align:start position:0%
worst public health emergency of our
lifetimes

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
lifetimes
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
some some people may have been around uh
 
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.470 align:start position:0%
some some people may have been around uh
with

01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me when polio was uh
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
was was emerging
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
but really this is for for most of us
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
the worst pandemic of our lifetimes
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
um there has not been a
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
an emergency call to mandate a vaccine
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
for school children and in fact even
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 1633 which this committee
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
heard recently uh which would mandate
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
the covet 19 vaccine for school children
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
even that acknowledges that that such a
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
mandate shouldn't go into effect until
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
after the vaccine receives full fda
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
approval and not emergency authorization
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
approval only
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know the second point i would bring
 
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
up with respect to imminent threats
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
does have to do with the polio vaccine
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
the polio vaccine had some there were
 
01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:43.830 align:start position:0%
the polio vaccine had some there were
some

01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
very tragic problems with the polio
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
as a result there was there was quite a
 
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
lot of hesitancy around that
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
having said that the polio vaccine is i
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
believe a modern miracle
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
it has saved people from
 
01:40:03.119 --> 01:40:04.550 align:start position:0%
it has saved people from
um

01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
from disability and and death
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
many many people and polio has been
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
declared eradicated in in the united
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
states as a result
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
the polio vaccine took seven years
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
to reach 80
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate seven years
 
01:40:21.679 --> 01:40:22.550 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate seven years
so

01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
here we are looking at um you know the
 
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
potential need to add a vaccine to the
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
required schedule of immunizations for
 
01:40:31.199 --> 01:40:32.310 align:start position:0%
required schedule of immunizations for
children

01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
and given the examples i've just
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
provided it it seems a stretch to me
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
that we could not do that through the
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
legislative process and that if we did
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
do it through the legislative process we
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
we couldn't
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
if it truly were an emergency that we
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
could not handle it as such and call an
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
emergency session
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
mr chairman that ends my my testimony
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
and i'll be happy to take any questions
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
if you like the chair has a question
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
i have heard from some people
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
why would you want the decision to be
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
made by lawmakers who don't know
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
anything about medicine
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
would you agree with my
 
01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:12.310 align:start position:0%
would you agree with my
comeback

01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
comeback
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to bet this bill comes to
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
where we have a good number of people
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
who are well trained in medicine and
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
secondly there'll be more wishing to
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
testify would you agree with that as a
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
good comeback
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman um
 
01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.070 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman um
interestingly

01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh the the the one person who
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
does have the power to create a mandate
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
under current statute does not
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be a medical
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
professional in fact we have had
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
commissioners of health and the current
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
one is by the way but we have had
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
commissioners of health and human
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
services in the past who are not medical
 
01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
services in the past who are not medical
professionals

01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:54.629 align:start position:0%
professionals
um

01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
i i would argue that there is
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know there is first the question of
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
medical expertise and i do believe that
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
if we have an open and transparent
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
process which involves hearings like
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
this then we have ample opportunity to
 
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
gather that information
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
the the the other side of the equation
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
is that by making that an open and
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
transparent process made by the people's
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
elected representatives we are really
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
opening the door to much broader
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
participation in the process which i
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
think makes for better decisions
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman also
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my represent taking
 
01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
my question representative
 
01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.629 align:start position:0%
my question representative
um

01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
in dealing with rulemaking
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
having been on the board for several
 
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.830 align:start position:0%
having been on the board for several
years

01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's a long process it takes a lot of
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
public input
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's not something which is done in a
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
vacuum it does go through a legislative
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
process it has to go through the joint
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
01:42:59.669 --> 01:42:59.679 align:start position:0%
roles which is gelcar
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
so there is an opportunity for the
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
public to weigh in on what rules are
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
so i would say that there is legislative
 
01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.629 align:start position:0%
so i would say that there is legislative
oversight

01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
we also have the department of health
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
human services has an oversight
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
committee itself
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
so in essence we do have the ability for
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
the public to
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives so um
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
let me begin by saying it the fact that
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's a long process i will i will add
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
that to my points regarding the
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
ability to act quickly and uh the fact
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
that we can do that just as well um as a
 
01:43:35.679 --> 01:43:37.750 align:start position:0%
that we can do that just as well um as a
legislature

01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
so while it is my understanding that
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
there there is a a public input process
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
it is also my understanding that
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
objection to
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
administrative rule
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
by a majority of the committee is
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
required to to stop administer an
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rule from taking effect
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
essentially the the
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know the valid reason to object to a
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
rule must be statutory and so i think
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
that there are um
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
there are potentially grounds for for
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
concerns to be raised and for the admin
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
proposed administrative rule to be
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
withdrawn based on those concerns
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
it nevertheless still puts the the
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
decision ultimately in the hands of one
 
01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.030 align:start position:0%
decision ultimately in the hands of one
person

01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
and i i also believe that there is
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
considerably more attention for better
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
or for worse there is considerably more
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
public attention paid and press
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
attention paid to
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative process than there is to
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
the administrative rulemaking process
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons i think it's a
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
better if this is something better
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
handled through the legislature
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
this is really a request for a
 
01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:49.590 align:start position:0%
this is really a request for a
clarification

01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
so i think that you said that
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
since the current rules don't expire
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
until 2026 that the
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
that the specific vaccinations that have
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
been added through the rules process
 
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.109 align:start position:0%
been added through the rules process
would

01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
continue to be in effect until 2026
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you my intention was that they
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
would remain in effect until 2026. i
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
believe that in order to accomplish that
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
and put everybody at ease as to
 
01:45:26.709 --> 01:45:26.719 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that those
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
remain in place would require an
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill
 
01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.149 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill
representative

01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the legislative
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
process is
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
slow by design and is indeed still
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
slower than rule making rather
 
01:45:43.119 --> 01:45:45.430 align:start position:0%
slower than rule making rather
significantly

01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
would you not agree well actually i
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
should say and also that the
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
a public health response in an emergency
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
has to be nimble and
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
quite quick
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree that this would
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
really tie the hands of our public
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
health experts in terms of dealing with
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
an outbreak let's say we had something
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
like the um
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
the flu outbreak of 1918 that really
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
severely affected young people and was
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
highly transmissible
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
and they would not be able to act in a
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
nimble fashion to deal with requiring a
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine for that you mentioned a special
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
session but
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
would that be wise to hold in the middle
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
of a pandemic to bring everybody
 
01:46:23.119 --> 01:46:26.070 align:start position:0%
of a pandemic to bring everybody
together

01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question i i think uh
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
first of all we we do have ways and have
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
employed ways of
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh social distancing
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
that i think have that have addressed
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
the ability for the legislature to
 
01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.669 align:start position:0%
the ability for the legislature to
convene

01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
convene
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
during a state of emergency
 
01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:47.350 align:start position:0%
during a state of emergency
if

01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
if the legislature
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
chose to do so i believe the legislature
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
could meet long enough to amend rules uh
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
to make other
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
other arrangements to to meet
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
um but i guess you know the the big
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
question here really comes down to risk
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
versus speed
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
um i think the the reason that the
 
01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.550 align:start position:0%
um i think the the reason that the
current

01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
the current covid vaccinations have been
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
authorized under emergency use is
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
because there was a sense of urgency
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
around getting them to market
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
there are also significant concerns
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
about them
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that many of those concerns
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
arise from the fact that they were
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
brought to market so very quickly
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
um so i i would i would call out risk
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
versus speed i would also say that
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority there there are
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
quite a few vaccinations that are
 
01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:42.950 align:start position:0%
quite a few vaccinations that are
that

01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
that people take voluntarily
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
if you look at the
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
the the number of well i can i can speak
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
in dollar terms
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
about 30 million dollars
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
of expenditure
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
comes from dhhs on vaccines
 
01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.550 align:start position:0%
comes from dhhs on vaccines
every

01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:01.830 align:start position:0%
every
year

01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
and of that approximately three quarters
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
of that dollar expenditure is for
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that are voluntary um so
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
things like the gardasil vaccine
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
i i think in in in furthermore i think
 
01:48:18.870 --> 01:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
that even if you look at the covet
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine you're seeing fairly high
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
that are voluntary
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
yet there there is a significant portion
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the population um that has chosen not
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
to to take those vaccines so to me it it
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately comes down to you know if it
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
is really that much of an emergency that
 
01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:37.990 align:start position:0%
is really that much of an emergency that
we

01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
that voluntary vaccination isn't enough
 
01:48:43.030 --> 01:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
and we have to mandate it we have to
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
mandate it very very quickly and we feel
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
that the risk reward
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
is sufficient
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
we ought to be able to get together as a
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh just you you mentioned that the
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
covert 19 vaccine vaccination has not
 
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
been required by the dhhs
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
under this rule at this point in time
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that speak to the fact that
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
this rule seems to actually be working
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
then quite well
 
01:49:11.119 --> 01:49:13.109 align:start position:0%
then quite well
um

01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
i should say the statute is working
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
quite well
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
i would say that it it
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
speaks to
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that dhhs has taken a very
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
judicious approach towards this one
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.669 align:start position:0%
um so
i

01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
i always like to look at future
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
scenarios what might it look like under
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
a different commissioner or a different
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
set of people who are
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
running dhhs
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
i think the concern that people have and
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
again this arises largely from the the
 
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
kovitz situation and the fact that there
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
are mandates looming for a lot of people
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
should we take a fresh look at the
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
process whether it has already broken or
 
01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:57.510 align:start position:0%
process whether it has already broken or
not

01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
should we take a look at the process and
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
say this ought to look different if
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
different than it does let's not wait
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
for a problem to come up
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
my hand was up
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
about clarifying the effect of
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
repealing in line six the rule
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority because once you
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
repeal the rule-making authority there
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
is no rule
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
there is no authority to continue the
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
rules so
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
i i agree that representative cofoult
 
01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:36.830 align:start position:0%
i i agree that representative cofoult
has

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
so would you believe that i agree with
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative cofoult that
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment would be necessary in order
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
to continue those which i think we all
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
agree ought to happen
 
01:50:49.679 --> 01:50:52.070 align:start position:0%
agree ought to happen
um

01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
it was it was more a clarification
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it should have been a question
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
it was more a clarification of the the
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
process and what happens to rules when
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
the authority goes away
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you for your
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
clarifying question
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for these uh
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is the first time i've had one of
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
these things where the red light
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
actually came on it's valentine's day
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.189 align:start position:0%
 
my

01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
served probably under it in the
 
01:51:30.639 --> 01:51:32.310 align:start position:0%
served probably under it in the
legislature

01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
with at least six different
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
commissioners and you're right they're
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
all different
 
01:51:38.719 --> 01:51:40.149 align:start position:0%
all different
the

01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
understanding i've always had
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
is that the commissioner
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
seeks advice from
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
those individuals there's no
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner in the world
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
that can be trained in all of the
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
aspects of that huge department
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
so that the
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
department has extremely well qualified
 
01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.070 align:start position:0%
department has extremely well qualified
people

01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
not the least of which is a medical
 
01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:07.270 align:start position:0%
not the least of which is a medical
director

01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
and also an epidemiologist i can't leave
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
that out
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
that is available
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you've
 
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
noticed that the governor does speak
 
01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
often with the commissioner and the
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist on health matters
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
so that i'm convinced that
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
the commissioner does consult but if it
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
would make it better we could actually
 
01:52:33.119 --> 01:52:34.149 align:start position:0%
would make it better we could actually
say

01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
the commission to shall adopt the rules
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
in consultation with appropriate staff
 
01:52:39.599 --> 01:52:41.510 align:start position:0%
in consultation with appropriate staff
members

01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
would you care to respond to the
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
gentleman's question
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you mr
 
01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:51.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you mr
chairman

01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
i have no doubt that the commissioner
 
01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:54.310 align:start position:0%
i have no doubt that the commissioner
would

01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
consult experts
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
and professionals within the department
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh in in making such a decision
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh nevertheless i i do believe that um
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
the the discussion the debate
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
to sort of put all the the information
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
on the table before the public
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
is best served by a full legislative
 
01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:17.990 align:start position:0%
is best served by a full legislative
process

01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you mr chairman
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of questions so i'll
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
just ask them all and you
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
answer what you want
 
01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.430 align:start position:0%
answer what you want
okay

01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
what do the administrative rules cover
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
if we keep the current rules i'm
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
assuming i'm assuming that the rules
 
01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
mean the list of required uh
 
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.430 align:start position:0%
mean the list of required uh
immunizations

01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
not the current process of the
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner making the decision
 
01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.790 align:start position:0%
commissioner making the decision
um

01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm guessing that that's
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
what it is that it's the list of shots
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
we would keep if we put the uh if we
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
make the amendment that obviously
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
needs to we need to in order to say that
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
representative gay i'm going to let him
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
answer your first question so we don't
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
forget what it is
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh mr chairman thank you
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative for the question
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
um so the the administration
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
administrative rule um currently there
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
are the three
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
additional vaccines
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
those are varicella or chickenpox
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
hib and hepatitis b
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules also
 
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
specify the schedule for which
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
the the vaccines named in statute
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
are to be administered so um
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
so things like you know mmr
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
which which covers several of the
 
01:54:48.159 --> 01:54:49.510 align:start position:0%
which which covers several of the
diseases

01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
named in statute um are are called out
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
specifically so that you know mmr
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's two day two doses uh the first
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
administered on or after the first
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
birthday for grades k through 12. so
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
these are the and i'm actually not i'm
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
reading from a dhh document it's not the
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
rules itself but
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
um this kind of schedule is laid out and
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's based on
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
um the cdc schedule for these
 
01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:17.350 align:start position:0%
um the cdc schedule for these
vaccinations

01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
which is also sort of reviewed and
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
approved by a wide variety of
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
professional bodies including asip which
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
um i forget what asip stands for but
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's essentially it's a it's a
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
nationwide body that that recommends a
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
certain schedule of vaccines new
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire only actually includes a
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
subset of those we don't include all of
 
01:55:39.199 --> 01:55:39.990 align:start position:0%
subset of those we don't include all of
them

01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
um but but that's what's an
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
administrative rule
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
your second question representative
 
01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.550 align:start position:0%
your second question representative
okay

01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
we were on the question of time and
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
efficacy of time
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't it take a while to create
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
medicines and vaccines so the question
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
about that the legislature
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
would slow things down
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you say that the
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislature is not really going to be
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
slower if we need to do something
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you say that the legislature
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
would have enough time while new
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines or new treatments are being
 
01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:18.070 align:start position:0%
vaccines or new treatments are being
developed

01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
developed
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that would
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
nullify the argument that passing this
 
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.109 align:start position:0%
nullify the argument that passing this
would

01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
and the legislature
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
when pressed can get things through
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
if everybody's of like mind
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
i'm leaving out one more question
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
should i wait
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
yes um so thank you again for the
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
question um so
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
yes i i think the the time it takes to
 
01:56:48.719 --> 01:56:49.750 align:start position:0%
yes i i think the the time it takes to
develop

01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
develop
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
a vaccine uh which was
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
done in record time for for covet 19.
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
then the amount of time it takes to do
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
some level of testing
 
01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.510 align:start position:0%
some level of testing
which

01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
happened in this case as well enough
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
that they could do emergency
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
authorization usage
 
01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.950 align:start position:0%
authorization usage
um

01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:10.629 --> 01:57:10.639 align:start position:0%
but then the the additional time it
 
01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
takes to to get to
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh that full approval full fda approval
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
without the emergency use
 
01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.430 align:start position:0%
without the emergency use
um

01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
asterisk next to it all of that takes
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
time and i think that the the
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
legislature if it
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
i think the legislature is equipped to
 
01:57:28.239 --> 01:57:29.589 align:start position:0%
i think the legislature is equipped to
weigh

01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
weigh
 
01:57:29.599 --> 01:57:30.310 align:start position:0%
weigh
the

01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
the severity of the threat
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
the risks versus the benefits
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
of requiring a vaccine
 
01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:39.189 align:start position:0%
of requiring a vaccine
and

01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
voluntary rates of vaccination
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
up to that point to determine whether or
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
would you believe that in 2018 a
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
hormonal contraceptive standing order
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
bill was passed by the legislature and
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
in that bill there were
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
directions for the department to set
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules as to how that
 
01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:14.390 align:start position:0%
administrative rules as to how that
would

01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
work and that those rules are still not
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
finalized now in 2022 so
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules process is not
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily faster than the legislative
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative yes i'm
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with the bill um i am i was not
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
aware of the uh of the fact that
 
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
legislative i'm sorry that
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
administrative rules had not yet been
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
finalized as authorized under that bill
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
um i suspect that uh that the process
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
um can take
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
longer or shorter periods of time
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
depending on the the urgency of the
 
01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:55.030 align:start position:0%
depending on the the urgency of the
matter

01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
oh is there anything preventing
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
in a state of emergency of
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
adding a requirement of suspending
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
statute and adding a requirement
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm afraid i
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that so i'll i
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
will defer to some of the experts who
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
are going to be up here testifying after
 
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.830 align:start position:0%
are going to be up here testifying after
me

01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none representative merchant
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
you brought up a good point about the
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
administrative rules it is more towards
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
the statutory authority whether the
 
01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
agency has the authority not how they
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
use that authority
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
so in saying that i do hear the concern
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
about having some legislative oversight
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
would it be possible at that point in
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
time we do have a legislative oversight
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
for the department health human services
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee which is
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
comprised of
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
representatives senators and so forth
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
along with skilled knowledgeable people
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
on that advisory would you be willing to
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
consent to or consider
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner can only bring
 
02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
forward the rules with the consent of
 
02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:21.109 align:start position:0%
forward the rules with the consent of
that

02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's sort of i'm trying to find a way to
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
thread the needle here between
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
no legislative oversight because that's
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
what rules create versus having some way
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
to go through a legislative process that
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
does grant them the authority to create
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
do you wish to respond um
 
02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:45.109 align:start position:0%
do you wish to respond um
so

02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative i i guess i would simply
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
say that i think that it is important i
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
i know each of us represents
 
02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
the people in our towns and our
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
and because the participation in gel car
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
and that the dhhs oversight committee
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
is limited to just a few representatives
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
i believe it's very important that every
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
citizen in new hampshire have an
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be representative be
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
represented as part of the full
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and would you believe that
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
there is greater
 
02:01:26.239 --> 02:01:27.709 align:start position:0%
there is greater
uh

02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
representation from the legislature on
 
02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.910 align:start position:0%
representation from the legislature on
jalcar

02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
jalcar
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
it's a larger committee than than there
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
are on the health and human services
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
oversight committee currently
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's a much smaller body
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
made smaller
 
02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:46.229 align:start position:0%
made smaller
yet

02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
yet
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago and made larger
 
02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:54.950 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago and made larger
again

02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
yes i would believe that
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
but my third question
 
02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:04.550 align:start position:0%
but my third question
is

02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
if i can make it into a question
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
do you think do you think that opening
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
for considering new
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
new guidelines
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
is much more extensive when it's open to
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
the public
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
than when
 
02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's just restricted to
 
02:02:28.149 --> 02:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
a couple of committees
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
especially considering
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
what has happened in the past couple of
 
02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
what has happened in the past couple of
years

02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
when many of us had no ability to add to
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes i i think
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
the the openness of the discussion the
 
02:02:49.109 --> 02:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for dialogue and and
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
input is
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
an important element
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh in my mind the most important element
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
is the representative process that is
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
that everybody have a voice in that
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
but i think you bring up a good point
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
and it is um that
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
as i said before i think the
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
the legislative process gets quite a
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
good deal more attention and
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
participation and
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
press coverage
 
02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:17.189 align:start position:0%
press coverage
then

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
than the rulemaking process
 
02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:20.709 align:start position:0%
than the rulemaking process
or

02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
taking the question um as we're
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
discussing this it brings to mind the
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
hearings that that were going to be held
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
and then were cancelled um at department
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
of health and human services for one of
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
the rule making
 
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that it's a bit of a
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
balancing act to try and hear
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's voices but i'm wondering if
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
you believe that our established process
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
to hear the people's voices here in the
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
legislature is actually a better fit
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
than having a representative's hall size
 
02:03:59.040 --> 02:03:59.990 align:start position:0%
than having a representative's hall size
crowd

02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
crowd
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
trying to come to hearings about rules
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
at the department of health and human
 
02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:06.790 align:start position:0%
at the department of health and human
services

02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
one of the great things about new
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire is that we do have such an
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
open process where anybody can come in
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
and testify and the committee
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
gives them time to express their
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
again i think what you're saying does
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
speak to the fact that the legislative
 
02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:32.149 align:start position:0%
speak to the fact that the legislative
process

02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
tends to be far more participatory
 
02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:36.069 align:start position:0%
tends to be far more participatory
than

02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
the rule-making process or the oversight
 
02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:43.270 align:start position:0%
the rule-making process or the oversight
process

02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
representative representative acton
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
my question is related to um the
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
rationale for for this legislation
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
i personally have
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
a very high degree of confidence in the
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
leadership of health and human services
 
02:05:02.159 --> 02:05:03.750 align:start position:0%
leadership of health and human services
department

02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
my confidence
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
collapses when we start talking about
 
02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
level agencies
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
would this bill give us
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to protect
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire from and out
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
of control or a power abusing federal
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative i i don't i don't know
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
that it would i
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
i haven't really thought about how this
 
02:05:34.639 --> 02:05:35.830 align:start position:0%
i haven't really thought about how this
would

02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
interact with federal uh mandates or or
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:05:40.079 --> 02:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
federal law
um

02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know even as it stands right now i
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier asip which you know in
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
the cdc um
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
so the cdc essentially asip is one of
 
02:05:54.069 --> 02:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
the organizations that is consulted as
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
in in coming up with the schedule
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
and um and new hampshire has not adopted
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
that full schedule so
 
02:06:02.229 --> 02:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
i think that new hampshire has acted
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
judiciously and
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
um has really focused on
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
um on on a limited subset that they
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
truly believe are important for our
 
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
children our citizens
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
um i the short answer is no i don't
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
think that it will
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
have any
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
give us any any
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
leverage or power to push back on
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
federal uh mandates um so even the cdc
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines are sort of
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
we're accepting the cdc guidelines for
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
this schedule
 
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
for the vaccines that new hampshire has
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
chosen to make mandatory
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
testimony in introducing your bill
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
the cheer now calls on from dhhs abby

public health services and i'm joined

section chief for the department
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
i wanted to thank representative cofoult
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
for his introduction of the bill it
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
provided some clarification on the
 
02:07:18.719 --> 02:07:19.830 align:start position:0%
provided some clarification on the
intent

02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
other than what we were we read through
 
02:07:23.830 --> 02:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
reading the legislation we are opposed
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
to the bill today and after the
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
introduction and the subsequent
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
discussion are concerned
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
about retaining our authority uh through
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
141c 20a to decide what vaccinations
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
are in statute and uh
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
and also to maintain our current
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
um and with that i'll turn it over to
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman pearson and
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i'm ann marie
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
mccary i'm the immunization section
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
chief for the department of health and
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
human services public health
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
um so thank you very much
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
for the comments and everything this
 
02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:05.589 align:start position:0%
for the comments and everything this
morning

02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
the department does strongly oppose hb
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
1379 as it would undermine the the
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
protection of children from vaccine
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
we do currently experience high rates of
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination largely because of our
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
school immunization requirements and the
 
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner's authority to adopt
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
these new vaccine requirements is
 
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
deemed to be critical and essential
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns about
 
02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:36.550 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns about
1379

02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
1379
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
as it is written it would remove those
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
other diseases which require vaccination
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
under administrative rule hep 301
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
including hepatitis b varicella and
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
hemophilus influenza type b
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
these vaccines
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
these diseases are not benign
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
we need to really remember about what
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
was happening before these vaccines were
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
before hib was available
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
and widely used approximately 20 000 u.s
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
children received
 
02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:09.990 align:start position:0%
children received
exposure

02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
to this bacteria and it's a large and
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
leading cause of bacterial meningitis
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
for children that are less than five
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
years of age
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
for those children that did
 
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
become infected
 
02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
there was a one in 20 chance that they
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
would die and of those survivors 10 to
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
30 percent of those children
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
had experienced permanent brain damage
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
so we really do want to remember that
 
02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:37.430 align:start position:0%
so we really do want to remember that
these

02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
diseases are not benign
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
so when we do
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
bring the vaccines into the state for
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
offering we do need to remember that
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
there are many processes that are taken
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
in taking place
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
first off before the new hampshire
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
immunization program adopts a vaccine
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
under the vaccine for children program
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
there is a vaccine selection committee
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
that takes place within the department
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
that would include input from providers
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
from epidemiologists and from experts
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
to really look at the vaccine safety
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
effectiveness before new hampshire even
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
decides to bring in the vaccine into the
 
02:10:14.719 --> 02:10:15.589 align:start position:0%
decides to bring in the vaccine into the
state

02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
and then there is subsequent
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules process that is
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
followed before making that school
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
immunization requirement
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
as noted there are 16
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are recommended by acip
 
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are recommended by acip
the

02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on immunization
 
02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.149 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on immunization
practices

02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
practices
 
02:10:36.390 --> 02:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
only 10 of those are required in new
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire new hampshire historically has
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
been a very slow adopter of school
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements
 
02:10:46.149 --> 02:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
there are many states that offer other
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines that have been in existence for
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
quite a long time that new hampshire has
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
chosen not to go ahead and make school
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
requirements so there is very careful
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
consideration before making that
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
determination it is a so slow process
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
that is done very carefully
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
within the department and under the
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner's authority
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
historically speaking the hepatitis b
 
02:11:13.470 --> 02:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine that was fda approved in
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
1881 and adopted in 1996 for varicella
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
fda approved in 1995 and approved as a
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
school vaccination requirement in 2003
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
so historically there have been years
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
the department is very clear about there
 
02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
is no intention to require covid19
 
02:11:33.679 --> 02:11:35.109 align:start position:0%
is no intention to require covid19
vaccination

02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
for immunization for child care or state
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
at this time given what we know about
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and given what we know about
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
the effects of
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
of co on children
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
it's also important for the commissioner
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
to retain this authority not necessarily
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
for the new vaccines that are coming out
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
but for the ones that are in effect when
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
for instance meningitis vaccination
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
the only state within new england that
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
does not require this vaccine
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
and we would want to be able to move
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
quickly to make that recommendation
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
should say rates of meningitis were to
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
increase and that's just an example
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
about us
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
really wanting to protect that authority
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to be nimble it's not
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily for covid but there are many
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
other diseases that may emerge at higher
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
rates within new hampshire that we want
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
and in conclusion i think that we just
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
need to recognize that we oppose 1379
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
the existing statute and corresponding
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
administrative rules do provide public
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
health protection it also appropriately
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
balances the individual and parental
 
02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.430 align:start position:0%
balances the individual and parental
choice

02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
choice
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
there are religious and medical
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions to all vaccinations
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
the process also takes in that
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislative input
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the goal of keeping the children
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
enrolled in schools while protecting the
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
health of the children
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
should this bill be adopted there would
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
be serious concerns about children who
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
are immunocompromised
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
and there would be
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
decisions on parents as to whether they
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
could send their child to daycare or to
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
school so this is very
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
concerning for us
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
chair has a question i believe i heard
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
you say that the national organization
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
would you tell me what that is again i
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
is it asip it's known as asip acip it's
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee on immunization
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
practices and you said they have 16 they
 
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
recommend that is correct and we're
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
doing 10 of them
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
where does that place us in
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
the 50 states territ and other
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
territories and so on
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh yeah somewhere somewhere in the
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
middle and i can forward the committee
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
maps of
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
other vaccines that new hampshire does
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
not mandate that other states do
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
this one for meningitis is very very
 
02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.310 align:start position:0%
this one for meningitis is very very
impressive

02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
the dark
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
are the areas that
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
require vaccination and the white is
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
where it is not required and as you can
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
see new hampshire is really an outlier
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
so i will be happy to pass that and
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
share that so we're standing in sync
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
with oregon washington and california
 
02:14:22.639 --> 02:14:23.750 align:start position:0%
with oregon washington and california
wow

02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
wow
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
that is correct and and out of sync with
 
02:14:26.239 --> 02:14:27.270 align:start position:0%
that is correct and and out of sync with
texas

02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
texas
 
02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:29.510 align:start position:0%
texas
okay

02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
i just did a quick scan on the map and
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to overlay blue and blue and
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
red states and
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't overlay
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
very well
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is public health this is not a
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
political agenda
 
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay protect our children
 
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
many but i'll try and stick to the bill
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
so am i am i right in understanding that
 
02:14:56.550 --> 02:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
maybe the reason for not adopting
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
meningitis is that we have a relatively
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
low incidence of meningitis
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
that is correct we have not made it as a
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
school requirement
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
some colleges universities do require it
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
if they are publicly funded
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
so it is really we're leaving it to the
 
02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:16.149 align:start position:0%
so it is really we're leaving it to the
discretion

02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the university systems where we do
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
not have the oversight of that
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
the incidence in new hampshire has not
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
risen to a level that we would
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
entertain this at this moment in time
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
but as we know that the
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
things things change
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
that there's sometimes incidents of
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
disease that rise
 
02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:38.229 align:start position:0%
disease that rise
follow-up

02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
well it's just a whole other question
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
but i'll do two and then i'll wave off
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:15:45.599 --> 02:15:46.390 align:start position:0%
is there
if

02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:47.830 align:start position:0%
if
this

02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:52.079 --> 02:15:54.790 align:start position:0%
 
adopted

02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
would it be better
 
02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:59.109 align:start position:0%
would it be better
to

02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:16:02.110 --> 02:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
have an amendment extending
 
02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:03.750 align:start position:0%
have an amendment extending
[Music]

02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that have already been
 
02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that have already been
approved

02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
approved
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
until 2026
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
or would it be better to simply amend
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
to include the three approved vaccines
 
02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
that have been added by rulemaking
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the opinion of the department the
 
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
department feels as though the authority
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
under rulemaking would be better um
 
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.270 align:start position:0%
under rulemaking would be better um
under

02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
the acip recommendations sometimes we do
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
have schedule changes so there is
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
changing of doses there's changing of
 
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
timing of doses
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
that schedule is outlined under the
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rules so as if statute
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
were the only place that we would have
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
that input we would not be able to um go
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
so it's not just the adoption of a
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
particular vaccine that is the issue
 
02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
going forward it would also be changing
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
dosing and scheduling
 
02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
as new information comes forward is that
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
correct that's my understanding yes
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nils thank you for
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
what i heard earlier was that there's
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
been a slow adoption of some of the
 
02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:27.429 align:start position:0%
been a slow adoption of some of the
vaccines

02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly which vaccine was
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
referred to but it was a a lag time in
 
02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:34.309 align:start position:0%
referred to but it was a a lag time in
there

02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
and what i'm trying to get back to
 
02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the administrative rules
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
when were the last adopted or changed
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
in order to include a new vaccine
 
02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:45.509 align:start position:0%
in order to include a new vaccine
2003

02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
2003
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
and that was for varicella
 
02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:49.030 align:start position:0%
and that was for varicella
which

02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
has the varicella vaccine has prevented
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
more than 3.5 million cases of
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
chickenpox 9 000 hospitalizations and
 
02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
hundreds of deaths each year
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
chickenpox we consider that as a rite of
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
passage for many of us
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
but we also have to realize that the
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
failing to prevent the check-in box also
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
means that individuals
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
who were infected have a greater chance
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
of shingles as adults
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:18:22.830 --> 02:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
in adopting the rules for verizon in
 
02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:24.549 align:start position:0%
in adopting the rules for verizon in
2003

02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
2003
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
was that something done through a long
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
process because i think it was on the
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
schedule before that quite some time
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
before the state actually adopted it so
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get to is that the speed
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
in which we're acting at the
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
administrative level versus legislative
 
02:18:37.599 --> 02:18:38.389 align:start position:0%
administrative level versus legislative
level

02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
in some ways legislative is moving
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
faster than what the agencies going
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
through rule making process
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question i'm sorry i
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't have that information about the
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
time lag on that
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes i wanted to revisit the question
 
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
that representative weber made about
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
taking the three that are currently
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
under rules and just putting them in as
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
required vaccinations and you commented
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
about the need for being in rules
 
02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
because the ability to set dosing
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
schedules and so on and so forth
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
but don't we already have that right for
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
all of the ones which are listed already
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
such as ethereum lumps pertussis that
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
under administrative rules you can
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
change those doses and so on as needed
 
02:19:19.439 --> 02:19:20.469 align:start position:0%
change those doses and so on as needed
anyway

02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
wondering wouldn't it be better if we
 
02:19:25.349 --> 02:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
just got them into statute
 
02:19:27.669 --> 02:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
to begin with and then you would have
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
the rules that would apply to that
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
rather than keeping them as a separate
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
sort of class of vaccinations
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
unless there were a reason you might
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
think you might drop that vaccination
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
then that would be a good reason
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
to keep them in rules but i was curious
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative knurk um emory can speak
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the the programmatic programmatic
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
goals i i think that we would like to
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
retain our authority in roles it just
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
adds more flexibility for us um as emiry
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
said if if there's a dosing change we
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
would be able to address that there
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
if there was an occasion where we might
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
need to drop a
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know a requirement that we had put
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
in statute then that would be
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the ability for the
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
members of the public to find when
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a hearing on
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
myself as a legislator i have had a very
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
difficult time finding that
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
and i i'm concerned that there would not
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
be public input from constituents who
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise would like to have input
 
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
because they are unaware that the
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
hearings are taking place
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
what um
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
could you
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
enlighten us on
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
how that can be
 
02:20:49.359 --> 02:20:50.230 align:start position:0%
how that can be
sure

02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative cushman when uh rules are
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
being processed and we have submitted a
 
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
rule to delcar there is a public hearing
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
that is posted on our website and i
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
believe is publicly noticed by gelcar as
 
02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:02.469 align:start position:0%
believe is publicly noticed by gelcar as
well

02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
so it's really i think that
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
the process is you if you're looking for
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
that rule you need to be able to to find
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
it on our website you can do that by
 
02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:10.230 align:start position:0%
it on our website you can do that by
searching

02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
searching
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
information would be available through
 
02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
the gel car sort of web page if you will
 
02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:18.630 align:start position:0%
the gel car sort of web page if you will
currently

02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
please thank you mr chairman um
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
would you
 
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
be agreeable to some kind of amendment
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
to require that those rules also be
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
noticed in the legislative calendar
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
the public can and legislators can be
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
made aware of it and find it easily
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
where they're normally looking for
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
legislative changes
 
02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:44.950 align:start position:0%
legislative changes
uh

02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
sure i think that that would be a
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
conversation for the policymakers to
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
have with gelcar to see how that would
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
be best better noticed
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and also thank you
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
for taking the question my understanding
 
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
is gel card does post
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the legislative calendar its meetings
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
and is also if you go to their website
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's a comment that i have to follow
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
you would believe that you would believe
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
that you would thank you very much
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative mckay
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
very trusting of us thank you
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative mckay thank you mr
 
02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.990 align:start position:0%
representative mckay thank you mr
chairman

02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:27.590 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is a question around how the
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner operates and i
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
suspect you don't want to answer those
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
questions and maybe john williams would
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
but that
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding is when ols
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
deals with legislation
 
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
they always put in the commissioner will
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
do whatever it is
 
02:22:47.439 --> 02:22:48.469 align:start position:0%
do whatever it is
not

02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
recognizing that the commissioner and
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
the department are synonymous
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
but that
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
does the commissioner consult with
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
with the professionals that we're
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
discussing right now as a routine matter
 
02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:06.550 align:start position:0%
discussing right now as a routine matter
in

02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh making decisions because the
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
question has been raised about
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
the the training of a commissioner
 
02:23:19.030 --> 02:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
and we know that there's no
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
training in the world
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
that could
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
train a commissioner to do everything
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
that that department does
 
02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
so that i've always assumed
 
02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:29.990 align:start position:0%
so that i've always assumed
that

02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner consults and having
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
known the present commissioner for a
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
long time
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's my assumption that she does do that
 
02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
can you comment about that without
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
any great fear
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:23:47.429 --> 02:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
representative k uh sure uh the
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner um has a medical director
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh dr jonathan ballard which is uh as
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
medical director of dhhs as well as dr
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
chan which is epidemiologist uh the
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
clinical the rules that you see um that
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
are written for the department related
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
to clinical issues and matters are
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
written by subject matter experts who
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
who are practitioners and physicians
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
and certainly there's broad consultation
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
with many stakeholders
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
and and clinicians before making any
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
important medical decisions that you
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
would certainly that a commissioner
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
would implement in the state
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
the chair has a question um
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
i find sometimes
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
a hearing
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
can serve as a safety valve
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
and that during a crisis
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
some people feel panicky
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
and sometimes therefore
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
their emotions
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
can build up
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
and to know that there's a possible
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
outlet for that a hearing a
 
02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:54.550 align:start position:0%
outlet for that a hearing a
contacting

02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
contacting
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
one of us who is on oversight or
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
may not specifically add scientific
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge but it may give some
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
folks who are panicking and
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
understandably so a sense that their
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
voice is being heard and
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
i look at a number of the bills that our
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee and other committees have had
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
that seem to me to have that safety
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
valve value if nothing else
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
which leads to the question
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
given that
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
would you recommend some vehicle whereby
 
02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:32.710 align:start position:0%
would you recommend some vehicle whereby
the

02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
flexibility and integrity that the
 
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
department needs
 
02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
at least safety valveness
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the public's input could sometime be
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
brought together in a marvelous
 
02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:51.990 align:start position:0%
brought together in a marvelous
conjoining

02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
was a question in there i forgot where
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
could you think of something like that
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
would do that yes i mean i i i could we
 
02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
certainly couldn't give that thought i
 
02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:06.150 align:start position:0%
certainly couldn't give that thought i
would

02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
reference a bill that the committee
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
worked on last year hb 187 related to
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
emergency powers and there were some
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
outlets in that bill i think that this
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee had worked on related to a
 
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
variety of issues including some some
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
additional oversight as representative
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
merchant mentioned the um ethics
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and such um that you
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
know certainly i could direct the
 
02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee to to review that bill and see
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
if there may be some outlets in in that
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
legislation that was considered last
 
02:26:32.399 --> 02:26:33.190 align:start position:0%
legislation that was considered last
session

02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
would you believe there was an item that
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
was totally misappropriately called a
 
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
housekeeping item
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
that is attempting to do just this
 
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:50.790 align:start position:0%

02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and mr mccarry
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
nice to see you um i
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
rather than asking a series of follow-up
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
questions can i simply take you through
 
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
some inquiries and if you agree just nod
 
02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
yes and then we'll get to the end and
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
you can not yes or no so
 
02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:07.349 align:start position:0%
you can not yes or no so
um

02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
are you aware
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
of outbreaks of meningitis that have
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
occurred in new hampshire in the past
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
and is it common that these outbreaks
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
occur at colleges universities and high
 
02:27:21.359 --> 02:27:22.790 align:start position:0%
occur at colleges universities and high
schools

02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
and is it possible
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
that meningitis or other communicable or
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
given the
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
impending relaxation of quarantine rules
 
02:27:39.429 --> 02:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
may in fact show up in unexpected
 
02:27:39.439 --> 02:27:41.349 align:start position:0%
may in fact show up in unexpected
numbers

02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:27:41.359 --> 02:27:42.150 align:start position:0%
numbers
okay

02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:42.830 align:start position:0%
okay
do

02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
we and do we therefore need to have
 
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
rapid rule making response to deal with
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%

taking my question so
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
as i'm hearing all of this
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
i know meningitis has been around for a
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
long time um but do you believe that
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
there is if there's a rise in infections
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
that the legislature could not respond
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
in a nimble way are you are you saying
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
that that the legislature is
 
02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:34.950 align:start position:0%
that that the legislature is
not

02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
you can't trust the legislature to
 
02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:38.469 align:start position:0%
you can't trust the legislature to
move

02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
move
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
quickly to help with these
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
with an arising situation
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't know
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know how you feel about us thank you
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
for the question uh representative
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
delemus i i don't think it's a matter of
 
02:28:53.349 --> 02:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
trust certainly it's a matter of being
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
as you said
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
able to act quickly if there's an
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
outbreak of meningitis decisions need to
 
02:28:59.750 --> 02:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
be made very quickly so people don't
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
lose their lives it's not that the
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislature wouldn't do everything they
 
02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
could to meet but there could be um
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
delays that we would not want to um to
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
have due to the severity of any kind of
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
outbreak and it really would be
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
protective of public health to maybe to
 
02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
consult with clinicians to make the
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
right decisions with without having that
 
02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
extra step follow-up
 
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
has there been a situation i i just
 
02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
would like to know
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh give an anecdotal situation where
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
that has happened where you've had to
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
move quickly to make rules or change
 
02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
move quickly to make rules or change
rules

02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
to date no
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
thank you would it be possible again i
 
02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
love to square circles whenever possible
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's not always possible but sometimes
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the department to be
 
02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:53.190 align:start position:0%
for the department to be
authorized

02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
in an extreme emergency where you got to
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
move fast
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
to move fast
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
for a 60-day period 90-day period
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
at which
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
time then the legislature we believe
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
will have had the opportunity to meet
 
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
to either say keep doing it or stop
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
doing it but you've got that ex
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
emergency response
 
02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:18.710 align:start position:0%
emergency response
ability

02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
ability
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i do
 
02:30:24.309 --> 02:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
believe under rsa uh 21p if it is the
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
statute that has affects the
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner's emergency powers there
 
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
there is that ability um if the if this
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
if it's the will of the policy committee
 
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
to put a check on that and say you know
 
02:30:37.510 --> 02:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
90 days after that decisions made that
 
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
there would be a check that would be up
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
to um the decision of the policy
 
02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:42.230 align:start position:0%
to um the decision of the policy
committee

02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
in an extreme emergency wouldn't those
 
02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
powers also be vested in the governor
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes um that's
 
02:30:55.359 --> 02:30:56.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes um that's
correct

02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
and it is it not true that
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
although confronted with a fairly large
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
emergency the governor did not take that
 
02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:05.030 align:start position:0%
emergency the governor did not take that
step

02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
step
 
02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
in this last
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
in this last case right um there are
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
issuances of emergency orders to meet
 
02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
that need right thank you
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
02:31:21.670 --> 02:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
are you aware
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
that the many tv announcements on covid
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
that the governor and commissioner and
 
02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:29.110 align:start position:0%
that the governor and commissioner and
dr

02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
dr
 
02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:31.510 align:start position:0%
dr
chan

02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
never mentioned preventive
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
bolstering of immunity like
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to take vitamin d3
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
and zinc and all these other things that
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
we've learned about recently
 
02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
and then were you aware that the
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner actually banned the
 
02:31:50.590 --> 02:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
treatment of covid with
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
topic months you for the question uh the
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
department agrees that the most
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
effective and safe way to protect
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
against coven 19 is uh the covet 19
 
02:32:04.240 --> 02:32:07.429 align:start position:0%
against coven 19 is uh the covet 19
vaccination

02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
yes i would add um certainly when you
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
look at health holistically we do
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
believe that it's also true that people
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
should do anything they can to stay
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
healthy which is exercise get some you
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
know be out in the sun and take vitamins
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
and supplements to provide that but the
 
02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
coven 19 vaccination is the best
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
tool against covet 19.
 
02:32:28.790 --> 02:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that during the state of
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
emergency when you reference the
 
02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
medication that was put on hold by the
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner i think that was due to a
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
shortage a perceived shortage that there
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
may be that drug is used for other
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
things and there were concerns that
 
02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
there may be a shortage um i said i
 
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
think certainly that um going back to my
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
further reference back to hb 187 last
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
year i do believe if you review that
 
02:32:49.270 --> 02:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
there is a provision that was added in
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
that bill to address the issue that you
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%

this is a bill that provides appropriate
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
needed balance i'm going to jump right
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
to a correction here
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the department of
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
health and human services already
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
mandates covet vaccines for children in
 
02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to you know jump right to
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
that part so let me go through
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
my testimony here and that is
 
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
through the foster family rules that
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
were imposed on foster children
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
while the the there are public hearings
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
proposed on rules that rega the the the
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
process requires um
 
02:34:37.990 --> 02:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
public hearings those hearings are
 
02:34:39.510 --> 02:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to find as we've heard and
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
most people including legislators don't
 
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
know they have access to those
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
concurrence is the correct term as the
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
legislative committee jail car has no
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
authority to amend proposed rules and no
 
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
authority to deny the rules that the
 
02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner has statutory authority to
 
02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:55.590 align:start position:0%
commissioner has statutory authority to
impose

02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
impose
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
the public has historically been denied
 
02:34:59.110 --> 02:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to express concerns or
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
support through the jail car meeting
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
even though statute provides them that
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity at the june 5th 2020 jail
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
car meeting at the foster family rules
 
02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
there were 89 concerned parents on that
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
zoom call only one and that was me was
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak briefly and when i
 
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
question legislative authority to impose
 
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
these aggressive max vaccine mandates
 
02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:20.150 align:start position:0%
these aggressive max vaccine mandates
that

02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
are that require every cdc recommended
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines and that's where the coveted
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
mandate comes in
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
because the cdc now recommends covet
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines for adolescents and young
 
02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:32.550 align:start position:0%
vaccines for adolescents and young
adults

02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
adults
 
02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
without religious exemption i was cut
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
off and no one else was allowed to speak
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
so there are vaccine mandates and foster
 
02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:41.510 align:start position:0%
so there are vaccine mandates and foster
families

02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
for the covet vaccine and it's for
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
children in the foster family household
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
foster children biological children and
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
this is up to age 21.
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
so you should be aware that there
 
02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
already are coveted vaccine mandates i
 
02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
will remind you that you asked to speak
 
02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
for three minutes and it's over the
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
lunch hour so i'm going to ask you to be
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
brief please okay
 
02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:02.870 align:start position:0%
brief please okay
um

02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
something as serious as vaccines require
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
a thorough review
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
and only the legislative process
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
provides that thorough review as i've
 
02:36:12.870 --> 02:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
experienced for the jail car process
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
as we've heard the commissioner need not
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
be a doctor in fact our current
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner is not a doctor she is a
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
nurse but the previous commissioner
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
prior to her was an attorney with no
 
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
medical background there was mention by
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
dhhs there's a vaccine selection
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
committee but in fact i made a 91a
 
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
request for information on the vaccine
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
selection committee in minutes of their
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
meetings and i was told there was no
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
records responsive to my request so
 
02:36:43.349 --> 02:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
apparently that committee does not exist
 
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
the hepatitis b vaccine history shows
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
that there were no recorded cases of
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
hepatitis b in infants and babies in new
 
02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire prior to imposing that vaccine
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
requirement so there's never been an
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
established need
 
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
for that vaccine on children to reduce
 
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
zero below zero
 
02:37:05.349 --> 02:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
in fact hepatitis b is not a
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
communicable disease in a daycare
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
childhood setting and the fact of that
 
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
is emphasized by the fact that a daycare
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
worker or a teacher can be hepatitis b
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
positive and they could be in that
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
daycare and in that classroom but a
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
child who's not submitted to three doses
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
of that vaccine
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
could not that's not a benign vaccine
 
02:37:28.150 --> 02:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
they've already been 65 reported deaths
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
of infants in new hampshire because of
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
the hepatitis b vaccines where
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
where shots are being rushed to market
 
02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
and children are dying following these
 
02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
shots the time is now for the
 
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislature to resume their authority
 
02:37:43.349 --> 02:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
over vaccine requirements and to guard
 
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
against vaccine requirements that would
 
02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
cause more harm than good for our
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
children and i please urge you to vote
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
as ought to pass on this very good bill
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
very and very needed bill
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
02:37:58.950 --> 02:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
i did rush through
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%

02:38:03.990 --> 02:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i don't i do not
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%

02:38:10.950 --> 02:38:10.960 align:start position:0%

02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
people from
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
the hhs about the issue with foster
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%

02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
condon you may step down
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%

respond
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
assertions were made and
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear what the department
 
02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:37.190 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear what the department
says

02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much chairman pearson
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
members of committee and we are always
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
here as a resource to you to providing
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
information um
 
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
as far as our public health um piece of
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
this they were not involved specifically
 
02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
i do have surface level knowledge that i
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
can get you more information on
 
02:38:57.270 --> 02:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that as part of our
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
rule-making process and compliance with
 
02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
federal law and federal mandates that
 
02:39:03.990 --> 02:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
children are in foster care settings
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
under the federal scheme of things and
 
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
again i can follow up with attorney joe
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
ripson who's our director for division
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
children youth and families that we were
 
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
required to proceeding forward
 
02:39:15.510 --> 02:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
with that as we
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
have to remember that foster care is a
 
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
voluntary process in other words we want
 
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
to encourage people to be part of that
 
02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
process but it is a process that family
 
02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
members who want to take in children or
 
02:39:28.309 --> 02:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
individuals who want to take in children
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
do have to adhere to certain guidelines
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
including those that are required under
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
the federal law for the funding for
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
those programs so there was to my
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge based upon second-hand
 
02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
information roles that were promulgated
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
within i believe the last year
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
that did address this issue there was a
 
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
compromise made and again i have to rely
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
upon those subject matter experts who
 
02:39:51.990 --> 02:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
were there that there was a carve out
 
02:39:55.349 --> 02:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
made for i believe households where the
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
foster kids were over six years of age
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm holding at that point because
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'm again working off of distant memory
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
of the subject matter and
 
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
given the scope of what the bill was
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
about today this is the best i can do to
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
try to respond to your question thank
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
you very much i'm going to ask that you
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
having heard some
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
statements that were made recently
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
you get back to this committee by email
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
and let us know
 
02:40:23.910 --> 02:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
how you see it yes and what i'd like to
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
do is actually have the appropriate
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
resources in touch with this committee i
 
02:40:30.389 --> 02:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
just did my very best just to give you a
 
02:40:32.950 --> 02:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
very high level information but i would
 
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
um defer to those at the division for
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
children youth and families to be the
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
ones that respond to this committee
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
regarding the specific federal law and
 
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
the mandate around that and the reason
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
why they were required to proceeding in
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
that direction to requiring certain
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
immunizations within households for

02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
i did
 
02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
now um
 
02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:16.469 align:start position:0%

02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
we have a few cards that came in at the
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
last minute and let me just say that i
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
find that somewhat disingenuous
 
02:41:27.269 --> 02:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
you've been here for a while you've
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
heard the hearing we try to plan the
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
hearing in certain ways
 
02:41:37.750 --> 02:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
cards that suddenly appeared
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
you will get two minutes each and we
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
have a timer up here two minutes we have
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
found in previous hearings people can
 
02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
really say what's on their heart and
 
02:41:51.429 --> 02:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
mind within two minutes
 
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
with that the uh chair calls shauna
 
02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:58.070 align:start position:0%
with that the uh chair calls shauna
healy

02:41:58.070 --> 02:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:05.110 align:start position:0%
 
what

02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and i apologize there was a
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
pile of cards over there and that's
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
where i placed mine versus handing it to
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
someone so mine has been there since the
 
02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:15.830 align:start position:0%
someone so mine has been there since the
beginning

02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
i am in support of this bill
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
as a mom of six
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
i have children with different
 
02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:22.950 align:start position:0%

fifteen-year-old son with autism
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
everything affects him differently than
 
02:42:30.550 --> 02:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
my other children
 
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
medication supplements food vaccines
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
there is no one-size-fits-all for
 
02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:40.070 align:start position:0%
there is no one-size-fits-all for
children

02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
three of my children are here with me
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
today they're homeschooled
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
because the last two years have
 
02:42:48.790 --> 02:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
raised some concerns for me as a parent
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're very well behaved thank you so
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
much well
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank them they're doing very well i get
 
02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:56.389 align:start position:0%
thank them they're doing very well i get
concerned

02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
02:42:59.349 --> 02:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
at dhhs making decisions for my children
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
when i hear them come up here and
 
02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of fear in their facts
 
02:43:06.309 --> 02:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
fear about diseases and
 
02:43:06.319 --> 02:43:07.110 align:start position:0%
fear about diseases and
how

02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
simply because we've been in a state of
 
02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
lockdown for two years that certain
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
diseases are going to come and start
 
02:43:17.269 --> 02:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
just being huge problems again
 
02:43:19.349 --> 02:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
i just think the promotion of fear over
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
the last two years has
 
02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
affected our children in such
 
02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
huge ways
 
02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:25.830 align:start position:0%
huge ways
that

02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have generations of of
 
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
issues going forward
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
parents know what's best for their
 
02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:32.070 align:start position:0%
parents know what's best for their
children

02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:43:35.110 --> 02:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
and these vaccines are still in clinical
 
02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
trials they should not be required to
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
attend school
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
where there's risk there has to be
 
02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:45.190 align:start position:0%
where there's risk there has to be
choice

02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
choice
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
one minute 34 seconds thank you so much
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
and if tony fallon
 
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you've noticed but this
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
microphone is like a doorknob now
 
02:44:14.479 --> 02:44:16.950 align:start position:0%
microphone is like a doorknob now
so

02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
i'm erin fallon i'm from wolfeboro falls
 
02:44:24.399 --> 02:44:25.190 align:start position:0%
i'm erin fallon i'm from wolfeboro falls
i

02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
met all of you wonderful
 
02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:29.030 align:start position:0%
met all of you wonderful
representatives

02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know six weeks ago
 
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about about
 
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
ivermectin and it was about religious
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
freedom it was about health care choices
 
02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm back for the same reason
 
02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i was here 10 years ago for lyme
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
disease for the same reason
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
lyme disease went for through the
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and gave
 
02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
infected people more choices because it
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
went through the legislature
 
02:44:59.349 --> 02:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
what representative colfax is proposing
 
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
is giving people healthier
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
educated choices and that's what i'm in
 
02:45:08.950 --> 02:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
tony fallon also from wolfeboro falls
 
02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
we aaron and i both spent 12 years as
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
adaptive sports volunteers skiing
 
02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:18.230 align:start position:0%
adaptive sports volunteers skiing
particularly

02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
we served primarily
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
autistic and other children on the
 
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
spectrum that were vaccine damage so in
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
general we're very cautious and with a
 
02:45:29.110 --> 02:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:30.230 align:start position:0%
lot of
immediate

02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
immediate
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
reasons for that and of course you know
 
02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
mandates and dictates
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
really sounds like dictators i i so much
 
02:45:44.399 --> 02:45:45.590 align:start position:0%
really sounds like dictators i i so much
appreciate

02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative cole fault bring this
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
forward because so much of what's going
 
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
on the last couple of years
 
02:45:53.429 --> 02:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
it's just mandates made its mandates it
 
02:45:55.990 --> 02:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're in a dictorial
 
02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:57.269 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're in a dictorial
situation

02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
bringing us bring it back to the
 
02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
legislature i think is vital
 
02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
this vaccine is under emergency
 
02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:05.670 align:start position:0%
this vaccine is under emergency
authorization

02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's experimental it's not effective
 
02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's damaging
 
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
and there's no fault because it's under
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
emergency legislation as are a lot of
 
02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:17.349 align:start position:0%
emergency legislation as are a lot of
vaccines

02:46:17.349 --> 02:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
02:46:17.359 --> 02:46:18.389 align:start position:0%
vaccines
another

02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
kind of personal thing
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
january of last year we had an incoming
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
medical missionary
 
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
that we were going to host for 10 days
 
02:46:30.150 --> 02:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
it turned into three months
 
02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
he was vaccine damaged
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
after taking the second shot
 
02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
it wound up with emergency surgery lots
 
02:46:41.190 --> 02:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
of trips to doctors uh denial
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
that it was related to the vaccine by
 
02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:46.469 align:start position:0%
that it was related to the vaccine by
hospitals

02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
they said he was experiencing spousal
 
02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
abuse he was single living with us so it
 
02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
there are as this was mentioned by
 
02:46:58.389 --> 02:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative gay there's other
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
responses besides vaccines
 
02:47:03.269 --> 02:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
that are being hidden
 
02:47:04.630 --> 02:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
and restricted
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
just as they were back with lyme disease
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
that that was such
 
02:47:11.910 --> 02:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
it was a long course to get that passed
 
02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
but when it passed it passed
 
02:47:15.269 --> 02:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly with both sides of the
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
aisle in a very divided time i don't
 
02:47:21.510 --> 02:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
29 years i've worked out of the house
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
as a health advocate my wife has
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
d all the above lots and lots of health
 
02:47:29.279 --> 02:47:30.389 align:start position:0%
d all the above lots and lots of health
challenges

02:47:30.389 --> 02:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
if we went by one-size-fits-all all
 
02:47:35.750 --> 02:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
she wouldn't be with us here we've gone
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
all over the country 30 seconds sir
 
02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
individualized care for individuals is
 
02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
so vital
 
02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
and having a broad spec spectrum of
 
02:47:48.479 --> 02:47:49.429 align:start position:0%
and having a broad spec spectrum of
choices

02:47:49.429 --> 02:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
choices
 
02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
to choose from is vital as well
 
02:47:54.389 --> 02:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh the last thing in closing
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'm an architect i think that the dna
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
that god did is pretty good
 
02:48:02.150 --> 02:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
i i also have a lot of caution with the
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
nature of some of these so-called
 
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines which rely on vaccines are
 
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
playing with their dna
 
02:48:10.469 --> 02:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
i think god did the dna right
 
02:48:12.230 --> 02:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you so much for you
 
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
and your wife's compassionate
 
02:48:18.469 --> 02:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:24.630 --> 02:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:30.150 --> 02:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you community chair thank you
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee members um i just want to say
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
the one thing that i love about this
 
02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:36.630 align:start position:0%
the one thing that i love about this
bill

02:48:36.630 --> 02:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
is that it
 
02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
helps break through that level of trust
 
02:48:43.750 --> 02:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
we lack trust we lack trust in our
 
02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
government we lack trust in in our our
 
02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
committee members and all this type of
 
02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
stuff this bill gives us trust and
 
02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
transparency and that's something that
 
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
needs to happen more than anything else
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
to pull us back together as a state
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and the the last one
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
we will hear from today is ken ering
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for the
 
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity i'd just like to be on the
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
record that i submitted that card before
 
02:49:27.429 --> 02:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
representative cole fault spoke yes you
 
02:49:29.429 --> 02:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
did sir i've asked for five minutes and
 
02:49:31.269 --> 02:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
i hope that you'll honor that because i
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
will give you three well you know i
 
02:49:35.110 --> 02:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and you're using them up
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
now so go
 
02:49:39.429 --> 02:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
02:49:39.439 --> 02:49:40.389 align:start position:0%
i believe that
people

02:49:40.389 --> 02:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:49:41.910 --> 02:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
have a right to be heard by their
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
representatives and if you would like me
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
to come back after lunch i would be
 
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
happy to wait but i believe i have an
 
02:49:50.230 --> 02:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak and express my
 
02:49:52.389 --> 02:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
concerns i took time out of my day as
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
well to come up here to express my
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about this bill
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
so i will respect whatever decision you
 
02:50:02.230 --> 02:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
make but i'm on the record as saying you
 
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
really should listen to the people when
 
02:50:05.309 --> 02:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
they come up here
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
dhhs has said that that their position
 
02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that covert 19 vaccination
 
02:50:13.269 --> 02:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are the best protection
 
02:50:13.279 --> 02:50:14.389 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are the best protection
against

02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
the covet vaccine
 
02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
the ceo of pfizer has said that there's
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
little to no effectiveness of their
 
02:50:21.359 --> 02:50:22.630 align:start position:0%
little to no effectiveness of their
vaccine

02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
people who have been vaccinated get get
 
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
the virus
 
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
and they transmit the virus so that's a
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
red flag for me
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
this committee listened to dr paul
 
02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
merrick for hb 1022. that man came up
 
02:50:38.150 --> 02:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
and he has professional
 
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
real-life real world experience that
 
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
ivermecton and hqc are prophylactics for
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
covid there's no reason
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
to have any bureaucrat be in a position
 
02:50:52.469 --> 02:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
where they
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
can turn around and mandate against the
 
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
will of any parent that their children
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
be injected with an experimental vaccine
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
dr robert malone who is the inventor the
 
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
scientist who came up with the mrna
 
02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:07.030 align:start position:0%
scientist who came up with the mrna
technology

02:51:07.030 --> 02:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
that is used to create
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
and produce
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
the modern
 
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
and the pfizer vaccines
 
02:51:15.510 --> 02:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
has warned
 
02:51:17.830 --> 02:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
that these vaccines are very dangerous
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
for children
 
02:51:21.670 --> 02:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
i send everyone in this committee a link
 
02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
to a video it's four minutes and 32
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
seconds i urge you to watch that video
 
02:51:33.269 --> 02:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
he warns of irreparable harm to children
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
potential irreparable harm
 
02:51:38.230 --> 02:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
to their vital organs
 
02:51:40.950 --> 02:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
their kidneys their livers their hearts
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
their brains their immune systems their
 
02:51:46.230 --> 02:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
reproductive systems
 
02:51:48.630 --> 02:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
and once that harm is done you can't
 
02:51:48.640 --> 02:51:49.590 align:start position:0%
and once that harm is done you can't
repair

02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
repair
 
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
the damage to any of those organs
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
there are safe treatments
 
02:51:57.429 --> 02:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
that are available
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
dr merrick came here and testified to
 
02:52:02.469 --> 02:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
that he did an awesome job
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
you hear the you hear the saying follow
 
02:52:07.349 --> 02:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
the science you had scientists here you
 
02:52:09.030 --> 02:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
have the ability to listen to them the
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
people who invented the technology
 
02:52:13.830 --> 02:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
this needs to be apparent parental
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
decision they have to be involved you
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
have dhs has came up here and said they
 
02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
need to retain their ability
 
02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:20.790 align:start position:0%
need to retain their ability
to

02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
make decisions about the vaccines
 
02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding this is only about
 
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
the covet vaccine there are alternatives
 
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
to that you should not and cannot and
 
02:52:33.670 --> 02:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
must not force a bureaucrat's decision
 
02:52:35.750 --> 02:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
on a parent when there are safe
 
02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
effective and inexpensive
 
02:52:41.429 --> 02:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
treatments for their children
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'll just sum this up by saying this has
 
02:52:46.469 --> 02:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
become a political issue we need to have
 
02:52:49.190 --> 02:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
checks and balances you all are
 
02:52:51.269 --> 02:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
accountable to the people
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's why you're here that's why you
 
02:52:56.630 --> 02:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
need to make this decision i'm cutting
 
02:52:58.630 --> 02:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
off my testimony short and respect to
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%

are there people who would like to work
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
with representative cofoult
 
02:53:36.150 --> 02:53:36.160 align:start position:0%

belknap seven
 
03:47:16.150 --> 03:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm here today to introduce uh house
 
03:47:18.630 --> 03:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
bill 1271
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
and the reason that this bill came about
 
03:47:24.070 --> 03:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
not have one person dictate to the
 
03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
entire populace of new hampshire
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
on a mandate
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
regarding their health in their body
 
03:47:36.150 --> 03:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
i do believe that the
 
03:47:36.160 --> 03:47:37.750 align:start position:0%
i do believe that the
person

03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
one person should not be
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
especially an unelected official
 
03:47:43.510 --> 03:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
should not have that
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
authority by themselves
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much what this bill
 
03:47:51.189 --> 03:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
does it also uh takes away the burden of
 
03:47:54.389 --> 03:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
quarantine and isolation of the cost of
 
03:47:56.550 --> 03:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
the person that's being isolated if you
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
are told to isolate and quarantine for
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
six months or 26 years
 
03:48:04.710 --> 03:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
which means you have a loss of income
 
03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
that burden of care should not be placed
 
03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
on you alone
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
and that should not be mandated by the
 
03:48:10.640 --> 03:48:12.950 align:start position:0%
and that should not be mandated by the
state

03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple
 
03:48:16.630 --> 03:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
bill very simple language but i'm open
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
for questions
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:30.150 --> 03:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
she's been flown in a great expense
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:48:38.229 --> 03:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative for taking this question
 
03:48:38.239 --> 03:48:39.510 align:start position:0%
representative for taking this question
um

03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:41.110 --> 03:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'd like to be able to see you when i
 
03:48:43.030 --> 03:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
talk to you
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to figure out exactly
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner
 
03:48:53.670 --> 03:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
were to decide that it was necessary
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
that a vaccine were to be used i guess
 
03:48:58.150 --> 03:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
in an emergency
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
this says that
 
03:49:01.349 --> 03:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
the immunization requirement shall
 
03:49:03.429 --> 03:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
require a two-thirds vote of the
 
03:49:03.439 --> 03:49:05.349 align:start position:0%
require a two-thirds vote of the
legislature

03:49:05.349 --> 03:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
would that be in
 
03:49:09.269 --> 03:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
when would that happen would that be
 
03:49:11.310 --> 03:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
like ahead of time or would that be
 
03:49:11.320 --> 03:49:13.349 align:start position:0%
like ahead of time or would that be
[Music]

03:49:13.349 --> 03:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:49:14.870 --> 03:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know there's an emergency the
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner says that the way to handle
 
03:49:19.269 --> 03:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
the emergency is through vaccination and
 
03:49:21.189 --> 03:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature would have to
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
what would be the mechanics of that of
 
03:49:25.189 --> 03:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
how that would work
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
question i appreciate it uh so anytime
 
03:49:32.150 --> 03:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
we roll out a mandate it takes time to
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
make that mandate to roll it out and in
 
03:49:37.590 --> 03:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
that time that she's discussing there'd
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
be plenty of time to call in the
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
legislature for a meeting
 
03:49:44.950 --> 03:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:44.960 --> 03:49:47.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:49:47.349 --> 03:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:47.359 --> 03:49:56.710 align:start position:0%
representative
weber

03:49:56.710 --> 03:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the current pandemic
 
03:50:02.790 --> 03:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't it true that the legislature
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
could not meet for a period of several
 
03:50:05.279 --> 03:50:06.710 align:start position:0%
could not meet for a period of several
months

03:50:06.710 --> 03:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
because there was no way that we could
 
03:50:13.590 --> 03:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
figure out how to meet safely either
 
03:50:16.710 --> 03:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
how to meet safely in person and
 
03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with emergency orders and
 
03:50:19.840 --> 03:50:21.590 align:start position:0%
consistent with emergency orders and
also

03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:50:21.600 --> 03:50:23.110 align:start position:0%
also
how

03:50:23.110 --> 03:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:50:25.110 --> 03:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
at that point we did not have the
 
03:50:27.429 --> 03:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
capability of meeting remotely or
 
03:50:27.439 --> 03:50:29.189 align:start position:0%
capability of meeting remotely or
virtually

03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
virtually
 
03:50:29.199 --> 03:50:30.790 align:start position:0%
virtually
and

03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:32.309 --> 03:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
and some people wouldn't agree to
 
03:50:34.950 --> 03:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
meeting virtually so if in the event
 
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
that the legislature was not allowed was
 
03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
not able to meet how would you address
 
03:50:42.150 --> 03:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
03:50:43.590 --> 03:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber for the
 
03:50:43.600 --> 03:50:44.550 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber for the
question

03:50:44.550 --> 03:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
first off we are elected officials and
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
we are bound by our position to
 
03:50:51.269 --> 03:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
represent the people of new hampshire
 
03:50:54.150 --> 03:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
and by due diligence to do our duty
 
03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore i think no matter what we
 
03:50:59.189 --> 03:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
have a duty to meet
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the safest way possible but it is our
 
03:51:04.229 --> 03:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
duty to meet and make these decisions i
 
03:51:07.269 --> 03:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
think that not meeting for
 
03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
a while
 
03:51:10.389 --> 03:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
was a disservice to the constituents of
 
03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
03:51:18.319 --> 03:51:21.189 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

03:51:21.189 --> 03:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:51:32.790 --> 03:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you explain the
 
03:51:34.630 --> 03:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
last sentence
 
03:51:37.269 --> 03:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
i i don't i just don't understand it
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh what do you mean by that
 
03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
it repeals the requirement that the
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
owner is responsible for the cost of
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
quarantine chicago and commodities
 
03:51:49.269 --> 03:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what that means
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
um it has been brought to my attention
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
that some of this language has been
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
changed uh last year in august up by hb
 
03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
187 and the folks behind me i'm sure
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
will speak to that
 
03:52:04.389 --> 03:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
but currently under existing law it was
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
the way that i read it and i am not a
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
lawyer by any means
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
was that if you
 
03:52:12.150 --> 03:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
were forced to be isolated or
 
03:52:12.160 --> 03:52:13.590 align:start position:0%
were forced to be isolated or
quarantined

03:52:13.590 --> 03:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
quarantined
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
all the costs of that quarantine and
 
03:52:15.359 --> 03:52:17.349 align:start position:0%
all the costs of that quarantine and
isolation

03:52:17.349 --> 03:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
isolation
 
03:52:18.790 --> 03:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
were on you
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
yes follow up sir i i guess the last two
 
03:52:30.150 --> 03:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
were what is then what is meant by cargo
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:39.990 --> 03:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative could i'm
 
03:52:41.910 --> 03:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the language here and i'm not
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
seeing that in front of me so i i guess
 
03:52:48.070 --> 03:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
yeah 1271. it says the bill also repeals
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
the requirement that the owner is
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for the cost of quarantine
 
03:52:54.550 --> 03:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
for cargo and commodities
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
what line are you on
 
03:52:59.189 --> 03:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
it's in the analysis on the analysis oh
 
03:53:06.630 --> 03:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
the intent was to make you well if you
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
have to
 
03:53:12.790 --> 03:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
quarantine your cargo and your
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
commodities because the state requires
 
03:53:17.349 --> 03:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
you to do so for an unlimited amount of
 
03:53:17.359 --> 03:53:18.309 align:start position:0%
you to do so for an unlimited amount of
time

03:53:18.309 --> 03:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:53:21.910 --> 03:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
that is a that is uh a detrimental to
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
you as
 
03:53:24.870 --> 03:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
a constituent
 
03:53:24.880 --> 03:53:26.070 align:start position:0%
a constituent
and

03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:27.429 --> 03:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
come back from that if that is your
 
03:53:32.150 --> 03:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
business or your livelihood for um
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.590 --> 03:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and also thank you
 
03:53:46.950 --> 03:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:53:48.550 --> 03:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
right now the way i read this the
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
current law
 
03:53:51.910 --> 03:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
an individual may refuse treatment or
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
immunization pursuant to
 
03:53:57.510 --> 03:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
provisions are say rsa 41
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
c 15 6
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
which basically is pretty
 
03:54:02.950 --> 03:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory so if the patient
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
already has the right to refuse
 
03:54:04.560 --> 03:54:05.990 align:start position:0%
already has the right to refuse
treatment

03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
03:54:08.150 --> 03:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
why do we have to have legislative body
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
given something that's already in the
 
03:54:09.359 --> 03:54:10.950 align:start position:0%
given something that's already in the
statute

03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:54:14.030 --> 03:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i believe
 
03:54:17.429 --> 03:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
141c16 is new and when this was drafted
 
03:54:18.630 --> 03:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
it was not
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
and i relied on ols
 
03:54:26.550 --> 03:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
to tell me what to do
 
03:54:26.560 --> 03:54:28.070 align:start position:0%
to tell me what to do
but

03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:54:29.590 --> 03:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
we still
 
03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
should not have one person and an
 
03:54:34.469 --> 03:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
unelected official mandating something
 
03:54:38.070 --> 03:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
letting me allowing me the follow-up
 
03:54:47.590 --> 03:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's not really a man mandate they
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
can make the recommendation for
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
something to occur but ultimately still
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
comes down to the patient heaven the
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
ultimate say
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
not the commissioner so therefore i'm
 
03:54:58.150 --> 03:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
still not sure why we need a law that
 
03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
already says the patient has the right
 
03:55:02.070 --> 03:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
of refusal
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i do believe
 
03:55:06.790 --> 03:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
um i haven't read 141
 
03:55:08.870 --> 03:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
c-16 when i was drafting this bill is
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
being drafted so i really can't speak to
 
03:55:11.040 --> 03:55:13.830 align:start position:0%
being drafted so i really can't speak to
that

03:55:13.830 --> 03:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:19.510 --> 03:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:26.469 --> 03:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
concept of commissioner is confusing
 
03:55:31.349 --> 03:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
because what what you are talking about
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
is a single person
 
03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
has power to do such and such
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
my understanding of how the department
 
03:55:39.439 --> 03:55:40.550 align:start position:0%
my understanding of how the department
works

03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
works
 
03:55:41.670 --> 03:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:55:44.150 --> 03:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner represents the
 
03:55:44.160 --> 03:55:45.429 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner represents the
department

03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:55:47.110 --> 03:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
the department
 
03:55:48.950 --> 03:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
is like we've already heard today three
 
03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
different people talking about the same
 
03:55:51.840 --> 03:55:53.189 align:start position:0%
different people talking about the same
subject

03:55:53.189 --> 03:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
subject
 
03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner is informed
 
03:55:56.319 --> 03:55:57.110 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner is informed
by

03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
very senior well-trained individuals
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
my impression is it's not the
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
decision of a single person a
 
03:56:07.040 --> 03:56:08.550 align:start position:0%
decision of a single person a
commissioner

03:56:08.550 --> 03:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:56:10.870 --> 03:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
and as i said earlier i've been at least
 
03:56:12.790 --> 03:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
six or seven commissioners since i've
 
03:56:13.990 --> 03:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
been here
 
03:56:15.830 --> 03:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
and they're all different
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
and if we would have such a
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
state of confusion if that was a fact
 
03:56:23.670 --> 03:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that every commissioner
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
i've known
 
03:56:27.670 --> 03:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
goes to the highly specialized
 
03:56:27.680 --> 03:56:29.110 align:start position:0%
goes to the highly specialized
staff

03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
staff
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
which is what i said exactly about an
 
03:56:35.590 --> 03:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:37.830 --> 03:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be interested in your response well
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question i appreciate
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
it um
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
you're right and i would think that most
 
03:56:43.439 --> 03:56:44.630 align:start position:0%
you're right and i would think that most
commissioners

03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
would look to a team of experts
 
03:56:50.309 --> 03:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
but the fact remains they do not have to
 
03:56:51.830 --> 03:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that lets alone that single
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner can make that decision
 
03:56:53.760 --> 03:56:55.349 align:start position:0%
commissioner can make that decision
without

03:56:55.359 --> 03:56:56.870 align:start position:0%
without
uh

03:56:56.870 --> 03:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:56:58.630 --> 03:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
seeking outside
 
03:57:00.790 --> 03:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
advice or from her

peers
 
03:57:04.870 --> 03:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh one single person can do it without
 
03:57:08.150 --> 03:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
any of any any advice
 
03:57:08.160 --> 03:57:09.910 align:start position:0%
any of any any advice
follow-up

03:57:09.910 --> 03:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:57:12.630 --> 03:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:57:14.950 --> 03:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
what would you believe that
 
03:57:16.870 --> 03:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee on health and
 
03:57:18.710 --> 03:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
human services
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
has some responsibility
 
03:57:24.150 --> 03:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh to counter what a
 
03:57:25.990 --> 03:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
what what i would say would be an
 
03:57:28.630 --> 03:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
inappropriate act by the
 
03:57:30.790 --> 03:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner and
 
03:57:32.150 --> 03:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
the instead of the whole legislature
 
03:57:37.990 --> 03:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
you've got the health and human services
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
03:57:41.990 --> 03:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
which i understand if i remember right
 
03:57:42.000 --> 03:57:42.870 align:start position:0%
which i understand if i remember right
meets

03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
meets
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
year-round it doesn't
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
follow the same procedure so there is an
 
03:57:47.760 --> 03:57:49.189 align:start position:0%
follow the same procedure so there is an
established

03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
established
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
structure there
 
03:57:52.710 --> 03:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
that could deal with that kind of what i
 
03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
would consider to be inappropriate
 
03:57:54.800 --> 03:57:55.990 align:start position:0%
would consider to be inappropriate
behavior

03:57:55.990 --> 03:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
on the part of a commissioner
 
03:57:59.910 --> 03:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm not
 
03:58:01.429 --> 03:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with that
 
03:58:01.439 --> 03:58:03.830 align:start position:0%
familiar with that
commission

03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'd be open to hearing
 
03:58:08.630 --> 03:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
things but i do believe
 
03:58:11.110 --> 03:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
that the way the statute reads right now
 
03:58:13.030 --> 03:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner without any advice
 
03:58:15.510 --> 03:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
from anybody can make a mandate
 
03:58:18.469 --> 03:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's appropriate
 
03:58:20.550 --> 03:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
i can introduce you to the chairman of
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
oversight at some point representative
 
03:58:22.960 --> 03:58:24.630 align:start position:0%
oversight at some point representative
leon

03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
leon
 
03:58:26.469 --> 03:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
i i'm reading through this and looking
 
03:58:33.189 --> 03:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
at the reference and it says that an
 
03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
individual may refuse treatment or
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
immunization pursuant to the provisions
 
03:58:40.630 --> 03:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
of rsa 141 c 15 6.
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
but that
 
03:58:41.840 --> 03:58:42.710 align:start position:0%
but that
reads

03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
reads
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
when an individual subject to an order
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
for treatment by the commissioner
 
03:58:47.830 --> 03:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
refuses to undergo such ordered
 
03:58:49.830 --> 03:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
treatment the commissioner may issue a
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
complaint which shall be sworn before to
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
sworn to before a justice of the peace
 
03:58:55.910 --> 03:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
such complaint shall set forth the
 
03:58:57.990 --> 03:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
reasons for the order imposing treatment
 
03:58:59.269 --> 03:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
the nature of the treatment to be
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
provided and the place or facility where
 
03:59:03.510 --> 03:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
the treatment shall be provided upon
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
being presented with such an order any
 
03:59:07.830 --> 03:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer shall take such
 
03:59:10.710 --> 03:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
individual into custody and transport
 
03:59:12.550 --> 03:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
the individual to the place or facility
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
where the treatment is to be provided um
 
03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking there may have been a wrong
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
statute because that does not sound like
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:25.269 --> 03:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
could i have an inquiry of the chair an
 
03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
inquiry of the chair takes precedence
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman uh and
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for your forbearance
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
i was wondering we have also been told
 
03:59:39.830 --> 03:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
by uh folks from dhhs that there is a
 
03:59:42.150 --> 03:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
mistake in the drafting here
 
03:59:45.120 --> 03:59:45.130 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if it might be
 
03:59:45.130 --> 03:59:46.469 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if it might be
[Music]

03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's entirely up to you but if perhaps
 
03:59:51.349 --> 03:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
the folks from dhhs could come and
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
explain to us what the issue is with the
 
03:59:55.990 --> 03:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
statutes because i'm in the same
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
bewilderment as representative leon
 
04:00:02.469 --> 04:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
and then we could have the proponent of
 
04:00:05.189 --> 04:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
the bill back to explain
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
better what it what it is that she's
 
04:00:09.269 --> 04:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
intending to do so that we have the
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate references in front of us is
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
that okay with you representative
 
04:00:14.790 --> 04:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
congress yes it is because what they
 
04:00:18.870 --> 04:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
have told me is the rsa 141c 15
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
6 has been stricken
 
04:00:25.269 --> 04:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
with hb 187 and been replaced with 141
 
04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
c16 and 141 20-c so yes there are some
 
04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
affirmative nods going on behind you
 
04:00:36.150 --> 04:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
so representative webber
 
04:00:36.160 --> 04:00:37.349 align:start position:0%
so representative webber
and

04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:39.429 --> 04:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
not only do those references appear in
 
04:00:43.030 --> 04:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
the in the bill as drafted but the
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
changes as far as i can tell are not
 
04:00:45.920 --> 04:00:47.429 align:start position:0%
changes as far as i can tell are not
included

04:00:47.429 --> 04:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
included
 
04:00:50.309 --> 04:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
in the rsas that i'm linked to when i
 
04:00:50.319 --> 04:00:51.269 align:start position:0%
in the rsas that i'm linked to when i
get

04:00:51.269 --> 04:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh when i when i go to the current what
 
04:00:56.550 --> 04:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
ought to be the current rsas so
 
04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
um any explanation that could be
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
provided would be really helpful so
 
04:01:03.670 --> 04:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page when we're
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
discussing okay
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%

chief

04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
chief
 
04:01:49.830 --> 04:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
and i i'm here primarily just to walk
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
you through what is currently existing
 
04:01:54.790 --> 04:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
in law and and what is not and then i
 
04:01:57.269 --> 04:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
will turn it over to miss rogers and
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
also miss mccurry to
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
discuss the substance of their testimony
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
but i think at this point in time
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
procedurally we're up here only to
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
explain the bill has changed and then
 
04:02:10.389 --> 04:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
miss rogers and also miss mccurry could
 
04:02:12.070 --> 04:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
come up separately
 
04:02:13.830 --> 04:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
to present on the department's position
 
04:02:16.150 --> 04:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
that is my expectation thank you
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
so if i can draw your attention to the
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill on page one one page bill line
 
04:02:24.870 --> 04:02:24.880 align:start position:0%

04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then the second cross-reference
 
04:03:19.349 --> 04:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
cites rsa 141 c colon 20
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
lowercase c again 141
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
dash c uppercase c colon 20
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
dash c which deals with childhood
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.590 --> 04:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
the provisions that you see on the
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
repeal on line 9 relative to rsa 141 c
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
15 roman 5 is in fact existing in law
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
and represent leon i believe you read
 
04:03:48.870 --> 04:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
into the record exactly what that
 
04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
provision applies to it applies to
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
commodities and conveyances and not to
 
04:03:56.150 --> 04:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
specific individuals but rather if you
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
look at that statute that it's repealing
 
04:04:01.349 --> 04:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
it talks about business owners their
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
assentees and others who are owners of
 
04:04:06.389 --> 04:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
conveyance and commodities so we're just
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
here to hopefully not create more
 
04:04:09.990 --> 04:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
confusion but pointing out what
 
04:04:11.990 --> 04:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
apparently was not drafted initially
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:20.150 --> 04:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative folsom thank you chairman
 
04:04:22.550 --> 04:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this question would
 
04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
the section on cargos and
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
commodities be better addressed by a
 
04:04:31.750 --> 04:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
different committee that has to do with
 
04:04:31.760 --> 04:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
different committee that has to do with
commerce

04:04:38.550 --> 04:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.110 --> 04:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes i would have to agree that this
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
would seem to be a bill that would go
 
04:04:44.229 --> 04:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
before the commerce and consumer affairs
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee in the house so it relates to
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
businesses and commerce so this transfer
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
will hunt then huh
 
04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you appreciate that
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:04:56.239 --> 04:04:57.750 align:start position:0%
uh representative
canark

04:04:57.750 --> 04:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
canark
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'm still confused you commented that
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:08.150 --> 04:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and now is that what is currently
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
when we go to the browse the statutes is
 
04:05:11.910 --> 04:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
that what's currently correct in that or
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
is that not this right wording currently
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
so uh reference pearson it's interesting
 
04:05:18.870 --> 04:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
that the laws that get passed it takes
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
approximately anywhere between four to
 
04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
six months for them to actually catch up
 
04:05:24.630 --> 04:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
to the rsa so many times when you're
 
04:05:26.710 --> 04:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
thinking you're looking at existing law
 
04:05:29.910 --> 04:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
until it actually is updated it you can
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
actually um not be looking at existing
 
04:05:34.469 --> 04:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
law it's just a fact of life that we've
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
all lived with who've done legislative
 
04:05:35.840 --> 04:05:37.110 align:start position:0%
all lived with who've done legislative
work

04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:05:39.510 --> 04:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
so if you go online at least when i did
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
it about two days ago i saw the correct
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
citations that were as a result of house
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill 187
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
and if you see in the annotations on the
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
bottom you'll see a chapter law
 
04:05:54.070 --> 04:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
reference and the year um it probably
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
even have the exact date of august 11
 
04:05:56.000 --> 04:05:57.590 align:start position:0%
even have the exact date of august 11
2021

04:05:57.590 --> 04:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
2021
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the um section below showing you the
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
current date of that section of the bill
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
follow up please follow up well that's
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
what i'm on if we're talking about 141c
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
colon 16.
 
04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
i've just pulled it up and it has 1986
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
1995 effective november 1 1995 and the
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
source below
 
04:06:14.640 --> 04:06:15.830 align:start position:0%
source below
nothing

04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
very hard not to be confusing
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
this bill in front of you at least as in
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
terms of section one of the bill seeks
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
not to amend the cross reference that
 
04:06:28.150 --> 04:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
has been deleted because that still does
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
exist in law
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
what it does is it amends rsa 21p53
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
roman 5.
 
04:06:40.469 --> 04:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
roman 5 does not exist in the current
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
format that you see
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
before you so that's that the cross
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
references within that have been uh the
 
04:06:49.349 --> 04:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
one citation on
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
line eight has been eliminated by virtue
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the legislation and replaced with the
 
04:06:56.710 --> 04:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
two respective rsas that i'd mentioned
 
04:06:58.950 --> 04:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
previously okay follow up again please
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
follow up so then to get that proper
 
04:07:02.790 --> 04:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
language if i remember right if one goes
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
to the bill as it's been enrolled after
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's been passed and signed by the
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
governor the pre the expected new
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
language which hasn't gotten into the
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
website will be there so is is that 187
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
was that the bill that did it okay it
 
04:07:21.429 --> 04:07:21.439 align:start position:0%
was house bill 187 again i went to the
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh revised statutes annotated that you
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
review online it shows the the correct
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
law the current law as reflected by
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 187 however when this bill
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
was drafted which would have been around
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
the lsi filing period in september i my
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
expectations are that the rsas weren't
 
04:07:40.870 --> 04:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
updated at that point however typically
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
to defend the office of legislative
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
services because they do a good job they
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
cross reference against bills that have
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
recently passed recognizing you can't
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
rely upon the online rsas because
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
they're not going to show you those
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
changes until probably anywhere between
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.429 --> 04:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
04:07:59.439 --> 04:08:00.309 align:start position:0%
representative weber
so

04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:03.670 --> 04:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
am i right in thinking that now one of
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
those cross references is to 141 c colon
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
16 mode of treatment and care
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
which reads currently because that
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
hasn't been changed it's just the
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
reference to it that's been changed
 
04:08:19.110 --> 04:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
nothing in this chapter shall be
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
construed to authorize the commissioner
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
to restrict in any manner a person's
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
right to select the mode of treatment of
 
04:08:27.990 --> 04:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
his choice or to refuse treatment when
 
04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
treatment is ordered by the commissioner
 
04:08:32.149 --> 04:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
under rsa 141c15
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
which is where we came from
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
or to request any physical examination
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
or treatment of a person who in good
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
faith relies upon spiritual means or
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
prayers for healing
 
04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
such reliance or treatment or refusal of
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
treatment shall not be considered a
 
04:08:49.110 --> 04:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
danger or menace to others under any
 
04:08:51.189 --> 04:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
provisions of this chapter
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
provided however that there is
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
compliance with the sanitary isolation
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
and quarantine laws and rules adopted
 
04:09:00.149 --> 04:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
under this chapter this section shall
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
not be construed to prevent a parent or
 
04:09:04.950 --> 04:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
guardian from exercising his legal
 
04:09:04.960 --> 04:09:07.269 align:start position:0%
guardian from exercising his legal
responsibilities

04:09:07.269 --> 04:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you that's much more helpful and
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
i'll look up the other one
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
forthwith this is
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is for the purpose of clarifying
 
04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
you will come back later for content any
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
other clarification questions while
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
they're trying to leave representative
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
canark actually it just is an enormous
 
04:09:30.309 --> 04:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
favor to the committee i think if you
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
could prepare a little document that
 
04:09:34.149 --> 04:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
would that would sort of basically take
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
the text of this bill
 
04:09:37.269 --> 04:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
with the pr well it shouldn't be that
 
04:09:39.510 --> 04:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
bad but with the proper references and
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
then put in with the proper language is
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
because i am still
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
confused i'm still looking up this five
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
and i still see the language that is
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
currently there and it except for the
 
04:09:50.640 --> 04:09:51.510 align:start position:0%
currently there and it except for the
bold

04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
bold
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
and so i'm confused if you could sort of
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
like i know it sounds like a rewrite of
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
the bill but it would be just giving us
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
the proper references so we could
 
04:09:59.830 --> 04:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
actually make sense out of it because i
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
am doubt that i'm the only one confused
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
04:10:03.279 --> 04:10:04.070 align:start position:0%
in the room
so

04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
i second that
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
chairman pearson again a careful
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
walk-through we're trying to keep it a
 
04:10:10.469 --> 04:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
very high level
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
here as part of our written testimony on
 
04:10:15.910 --> 04:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
the bill i understand from ms rogers
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
that we do have
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
the references in there
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of bearing ownership we are the
 
04:10:24.070 --> 04:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
department health and services this is
 
04:10:27.189 --> 04:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
not our bill respectfully and i do think
 
04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
that the office of legislative services
 
04:10:31.269 --> 04:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
to do a tremendously good job should be
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
the one who actually become responsible
 
04:10:35.349 --> 04:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
for doing what you're asking us to do
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
since they originated the issue before
 
04:10:39.429 --> 04:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
this committee we're just a messenger if
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's okay yeah but they're over there
 
04:10:45.189 --> 04:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
and you do get to tell both of us what
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative knurk we're now on to
 
04:11:12.630 --> 04:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
content or policy yes um
 
04:11:15.349 --> 04:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
given i was looking at the issues in
 
04:11:16.870 --> 04:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
line six
 
04:11:19.110 --> 04:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
given that it's not real common that
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
this legislature agrees with a
 
04:11:25.110 --> 04:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote on a whole lot of issues
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
and our bar for putting in immunizations
 
04:11:30.550 --> 04:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
of individuals normally is a majority
 
04:11:30.560 --> 04:11:31.510 align:start position:0%
of individuals normally is a majority
vote

04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:11:34.229 --> 04:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
why is it you require a two-thirds vote
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
in this particular case
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative actually i had
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
thought about that and thought maybe a
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
three-fifths vote would be more uh
 
04:11:42.720 --> 04:11:44.469 align:start position:0%
three-fifths vote would be more uh
practical

04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
practical
 
04:11:46.229 --> 04:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
but i don't think just
 
04:11:50.070 --> 04:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
simple majority uh it is
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
the way to go
 
04:11:52.000 --> 04:11:53.349 align:start position:0%
the way to go
follow-up

04:11:53.349 --> 04:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
but may i ask since it's normally
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
majority vote for all other
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
immunizations why is it uniquely
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
different in this case
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we should do things
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
along party lines i think we should do
 
04:12:09.520 --> 04:12:10.790 align:start position:0%
along party lines i think we should do
things

04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:12:10.800 --> 04:12:11.670 align:start position:0%
things
as

04:12:11.670 --> 04:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
a whole because we are representing the
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
whole of new hampshire so therefore
 
04:12:19.349 --> 04:12:19.359 align:start position:0%
a three-fifth vote two-thirds vote i
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
think would be
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
a better representation for the people
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.229 --> 04:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:12:31.349 --> 04:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i have a couple
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
of questions
 
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
one of them is the nuts and bolts do you
 
04:12:35.600 --> 04:12:36.790 align:start position:0%
one of them is the nuts and bolts do you
envision

04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
envision
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
a legislative consideration of
 
04:12:40.479 --> 04:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
a legislative consideration of
immunizations

04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
to be presented as a bill
 
04:12:47.830 --> 04:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:50.149 --> 04:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
no i think this would be
 
04:12:54.149 --> 04:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know the commissioner
 
04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
wanting to impose a mandate across the
 
04:12:56.640 --> 04:12:57.670 align:start position:0%
wanting to impose a mandate across the
state

04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:13:00.469 --> 04:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
and currently under that's one person
 
04:13:02.469 --> 04:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
getting to decide everything for the
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
entire populace of the state
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
and an elected official at that
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that bodes well for
 
04:13:13.750 --> 04:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
the people of the state and i think that
 
04:13:17.830 --> 04:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and in light of
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
what we've just heard from the
 
04:13:24.720 --> 04:13:26.710 align:start position:0%
what we've just heard from the
department

04:13:26.710 --> 04:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:13:29.189 --> 04:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
there is a section that
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
is incorporated here
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
because it says an individual may refuse
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
treatment or immunization pursuant to
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
the provisions of rsa and it's the wrong
 
04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
reference but what the r one of the
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
right references says
 
04:13:44.960 --> 04:13:46.229 align:start position:0%
right references says
is

04:13:46.229 --> 04:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:13:46.239 --> 04:13:47.510 align:start position:0%
is
nothing

04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
authorizes i'm paraphrasing
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
nothing authorizes the commissioner to
 
04:13:52.479 --> 04:13:54.149 align:start position:0%
nothing authorizes the commissioner to
restrict

04:13:54.149 --> 04:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
restrict
 
04:13:56.469 --> 04:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
in any manner a person's right to select
 
04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
the motive treatment
 
04:13:59.590 --> 04:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
of his choice
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
or to refuse treatment when treatment is
 
04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
ordered by the commissioner under
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
or to request any physical so so the
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
person can refuse
 
04:14:15.110 --> 04:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
the person retains ultimate authority
 
04:14:16.950 --> 04:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
over their body and they can't be
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
examined if they don't want to be
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
examined they can't be treated if they
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:23.840 --> 04:14:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:14:24.790 --> 04:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:24.800 --> 04:14:26.469 align:start position:0%
and
that

04:14:26.469 --> 04:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
if the person in good faith relies upon
 
04:14:30.870 --> 04:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
spiritual or prayer me
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
for healing
 
04:14:34.389 --> 04:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
they must be allowed to continue to do
 
04:14:34.399 --> 04:14:37.269 align:start position:0%
they must be allowed to continue to do
that

04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
and then it says such reliance or
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
treatment or refusal of treatment shall
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
not be considered a danger or menace to
 
04:14:44.479 --> 04:14:45.590 align:start position:0%
not be considered a danger or menace to
others

04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
others
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
provided that there's compliance with
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:52.560 --> 04:14:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:56.950 --> 04:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a further clarification that
 
04:14:59.110 --> 04:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
the section shall not be construed to
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
prevent a parent or guardian from
 
04:15:03.189 --> 04:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
exercising their legal authorities
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
so given all of those protections that
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
are already there in statute to protect
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
somebody from
 
04:15:14.469 --> 04:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
being forced to accept something
 
04:15:17.030 --> 04:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
that they don't want
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
an immunization requirement
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
of two-thirds of the legislature because
 
04:15:31.269 --> 04:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
the authority in the individual to
 
04:15:36.630 --> 04:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
refuse any of these things
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
as as as the decider of last resort the
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner doesn't actually ultimately
 
04:15:43.830 --> 04:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree that under this
 
04:15:46.229 --> 04:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
statute the commissioner doesn't get to
 
04:15:48.710 --> 04:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
decide anything ultimately about what a
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
person puts in their body or refuses to
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
put in their body
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
regarding what you just read it would
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
appear that way but without having all
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
the legislation in front of the rsa in
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
front of me it's really hard for me to
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
make a hard and fast determination
 
04:16:05.359 --> 04:16:06.550 align:start position:0%
make a hard and fast determination
however

04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:16:09.110 --> 04:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
what it does say also is that the
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner can still force you to be
 
04:16:13.510 --> 04:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
quarantined and isolated and i do
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
believe there's also a section where
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
they can tell you where you have to be
 
04:16:19.110 --> 04:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
isolated and quarantined at
 
04:16:20.710 --> 04:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that would be
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
a cause for concern um if i you if it
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
didn't go into further detail
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:16:36.149 --> 04:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
taking another question um listening to
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
or reading through that section that was
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
just read out
 
04:16:41.429 --> 04:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
when i'm hearing that it sounds like
 
04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's only protection for those who
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
only rely on spiritual means or prayer
 
04:16:48.070 --> 04:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
for healing so i'm worried that that
 
04:16:50.790 --> 04:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
might only apply to only a very very few
 
04:16:53.030 --> 04:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
narrowly defined and
 
04:16:53.040 --> 04:16:54.550 align:start position:0%
narrowly defined and
um

04:16:54.550 --> 04:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
and pretty granular uh sex so i'm
 
04:17:00.309 --> 04:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
curious as to whether the intention was
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
to have that more broadly based and this
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
was more of a drafting issue or if
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
you're looking to simply lock into what
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
what is already there
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
question and yes
 
04:17:16.229 --> 04:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
that point that you made up about the
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
religious exemption and like i said
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
without actually seeing the language in
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
front of me and reading through the
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
entire rsa to see how it all flows it's
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
really hard for me to make a
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
determination but as we're finding out
 
04:17:28.080 --> 04:17:29.910 align:start position:0%
determination but as we're finding out
now

04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:17:31.830 --> 04:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
especially in my county with our nursing
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
homes there you know some folks are
 
04:17:36.630 --> 04:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
applying for religious exemptions and
 
04:17:39.030 --> 04:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
they're being denied so the question is
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
is what would be considered a religious
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:51.429 --> 04:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative gay
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
do we have spell in the bill is there an
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
intent to spell out protection from
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
forced quarantines and the cost because
 
04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the description
 
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
but i don't see anything that spells out
 
04:18:11.830 --> 04:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
do we just simply wipe out
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
wipe out where it says
 
04:18:16.389 --> 04:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
europe creek and that's your problem if
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
you're ordered
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
or is there really protection and we're
 
04:18:21.510 --> 04:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
going to pay you back if we force you to
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
miss out
 
04:18:26.070 --> 04:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
and lose lose property
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
lose business expenses lose income
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
so at the time of drafting um
 
04:18:36.550 --> 04:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
we weren't really looking at the
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
quarantine and the isolation issues on
 
04:18:38.800 --> 04:18:39.670 align:start position:0%
quarantine and the isolation issues on
this

04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:18:42.149 --> 04:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
um but we were looking at
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
how the state was imposing that you
 
04:18:46.830 --> 04:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
incur all the cost
 
04:18:51.750 --> 04:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
what am i saying the quarantine
 
04:18:53.840 --> 04:18:54.790 align:start position:0%
what am i saying the quarantine
of

04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
your goods or your you know business
 
04:18:59.110 --> 04:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
property or whatever whatever you need
 
04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
to do to make a livelihood
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
anytime you do that
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're hurting the family unit which in
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
turn actually is a detriment to the
 
04:19:06.800 --> 04:19:08.229 align:start position:0%
turn actually is a detriment to the
state

04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:19:09.110 --> 04:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
government should not be forcing someone
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
to pay for something that they are
 
04:19:12.479 --> 04:19:14.469 align:start position:0%
to pay for something that they are
mandating

04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
mandating
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
it would be an unfunded mandate
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
so if
 
04:19:29.110 --> 04:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
if i am highly contagious
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
therefore i have all the rights in the
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
world to walk around the city the way i
 
04:19:38.070 --> 04:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
want somebody can't quarantine me
 
04:19:40.149 --> 04:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
somebody can't put me in isolation is
 
04:19:41.429 --> 04:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
that kind of the heart of this it's
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
basically saying that i can do as i want
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
when i want i don't have any
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility to my fellow citizens to
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
be sure that i'm being quarantined
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative i would hope
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
that each and every person
 
04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
and everyone here would take personal
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility for their actions
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that personal responsibility
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
is something that um we're losing sight
 
04:20:06.159 --> 04:20:07.349 align:start position:0%
is something that um we're losing sight
of

04:20:07.349 --> 04:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
and and and what we're doing some of the
 
04:20:09.600 --> 04:20:10.870 align:start position:0%
and and and what we're doing some of the
time

04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and then i look at um i did some
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
research on typhoid mary
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
and what i find found out
 
04:20:20.229 --> 04:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
that she was forced into isolation in
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
quarantine for 26 years of her life she
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
died alone with no friends no family no
 
04:20:26.960 --> 04:20:28.950 align:start position:0%
died alone with no friends no family no
nothing

04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
because she was considered a threat to
 
04:20:31.199 --> 04:20:32.550 align:start position:0%
because she was considered a threat to
society

04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
society
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative would you suggest that
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps that was overreach
 
04:20:43.110 --> 04:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
and that while she was contagious
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
quarantining even forced would be a wise
 
04:20:48.790 --> 04:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
idea but now medical science would say
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
26 years is probably not
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
a good thing
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and yes i would say
 
04:20:59.110 --> 04:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
that is definite overreach thank you
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
04:21:03.030 --> 04:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just for
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
clarification would you believe that
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
also typhoid mary was
 
04:21:09.990 --> 04:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
knowingly and directly related for 53
 
04:21:10.000 --> 04:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
knowingly and directly related for 53
deaths

04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and yes i
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
understand it was
 
04:21:19.110 --> 04:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
i thought at 51.53 yes
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman representative
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
just quickly are you also aware that
 
04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
typhoid mary refused to stop cooking for
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
families and thus spreading typhoid
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative salloway yes i
 
04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
in doing my research
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
because she thought she was doing a
 
04:21:43.110 --> 04:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
greater good she didn't realize the
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
extent of that
 
04:21:44.800 --> 04:21:47.030 align:start position:0%
extent of that
so

04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:49.110 --> 04:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
the chair again if that being the case
 
04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes is it not right
 
04:21:51.439 --> 04:21:53.110 align:start position:0%
sometimes is it not right
that

04:21:53.110 --> 04:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:55.030 --> 04:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
well-educated people in medicine may
 
04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
make a wiser decision than the
 
04:21:59.830 --> 04:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
individual him or herself
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
representative for that
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.790 --> 04:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
where it's it's a very fine line that
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
04:22:10.960 --> 04:22:13.189 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
so

04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think that people should go
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
around getting people sick but prior to
 
04:22:19.040 --> 04:22:19.830 align:start position:0%
around getting people sick but prior to
this

04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:22:19.840 --> 04:22:21.269 align:start position:0%
this
pandemic

04:22:21.269 --> 04:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:22:22.950 --> 04:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
people went to the grocery store all the
 
04:22:24.550 --> 04:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
time coughing and sneezing and getting
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
people sick we didn't ask them to be
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
isolated we didn't ask them to be masked
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't ask them to stay home we would
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
hope that they would have done that
 
04:22:32.399 --> 04:22:33.590 align:start position:0%
hope that they would have done that
but

04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:22:35.910 --> 04:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't feel compelled to do so but
 
04:22:37.990 --> 04:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't force them and that yet they
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
spread the germs and people did die from
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
the flu and influenza and pneumonia and
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
all of that from people uh being
 
04:22:44.479 --> 04:22:46.229 align:start position:0%
all of that from people uh being
contagious

04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
contagious
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
but they still went about their daily
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
lives thank you representative merchant
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman if mike can go
 
04:22:53.279 --> 04:22:54.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman if mike can go
back

04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
i also like you take personal
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility very seriously
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's part of what i have is a
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility to myself but also most
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
more importantly to my fellow citizens
 
04:23:08.070 --> 04:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
in society in order to have society work
 
04:23:10.070 --> 04:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
but what do we do with individuals that
 
04:23:12.389 --> 04:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
don't take that responsibility seriously
 
04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
that basically say it's my rights not
 
04:23:17.189 --> 04:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
yours and i'll do whatever i want and
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
therefore if i want to walk around with
 
04:23:21.429 --> 04:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
a contagious disease i'm entitled to do
 
04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
that what do we do with those people
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i do believe
 
04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
that we have people walking around with
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
contagious diseases all the time this is
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
not anything new
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's been happening since the
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.189 --> 04:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair last year
 
04:23:43.760 --> 04:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair last year
um

04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
last year one of your bills
 
04:23:50.790 --> 04:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
was did address this issue i wish i had
 
04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
it in front of me it would take a while
 
04:23:55.510 --> 04:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
to find it but we did have something in
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
there that made a difference between
 
04:24:00.309 --> 04:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
somebody who was contagious
 
04:24:02.630 --> 04:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
and somebody who was just being isolated
 
04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
just in case
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
and it seemed like the wording was good
 
04:24:08.149 --> 04:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
so would you like to
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
find that among the other changes that
 
04:24:12.229 --> 04:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
04:24:15.269 --> 04:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
amendments that will be necessary
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
i'm open thank you representative gay
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
for for bringing that to the attention
 
04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
um but yes um i believe um not my
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
particular bill but hb 220 was one that
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
04:24:30.239 --> 04:24:32.550 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

something that i think it was

representative leon brought up about the
 
04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
statute that's linked the new statute uh

um
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
sorry 16 i think it was um
 
04:25:45.269 --> 04:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
the way that we read that and i just
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to if i could walk the committee
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
through that is a 141c colon 16 mode and
 
04:25:51.750 --> 04:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
treatment of care nothing in this
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
chapter shall be construed to authorize
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to restrict in any
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
manner a person's right to select the
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
motive treatment of his choice or to
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
refuse treatment when treatment is

1. so so and then it goes on to talk
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
about the spiritual means of prayer for
 
04:26:10.469 --> 04:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
healing so we we consider that statute
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
to cover every every person not just one
 
04:26:18.389 --> 04:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
the department has serious concerns
 
04:26:21.359 --> 04:26:22.229 align:start position:0%
the department has serious concerns
about

04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1217
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
as it would undermine the commissioner's
 
04:26:27.990 --> 04:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
ability to effectively respond during a
 
04:26:29.750 --> 04:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
state of emergency in order to protect
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's citizen from a public
 
04:26:33.429 --> 04:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
health emergency
 
04:26:35.110 --> 04:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic a state of
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
emergency was declared in new hampshire
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
for a 15-month period the impact of
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
covet 19 has been and is far-reaching
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of the pandemic more
 
04:26:48.309 --> 04:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
than 284 thousand granite staters have
 
04:26:50.550 --> 04:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
been infected with covid19 and
 
04:26:50.560 --> 04:26:52.030 align:start position:0%
been infected with covid19 and
approximately

04:26:52.030 --> 04:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
2280 new hampshire residents have died
 
04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
in 2020 covet 19 became new hampshire's
 
04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
third leading cause of death behind
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
heart disease and cancer
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
emergency orders were set in place in
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
order to rapidly allocate resources for
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary vaccination to protect against
 
04:27:13.110 --> 04:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
covet 19
 
04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
and approximately 790 000 new hampshire
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
individuals were vaccinated during this
 
04:27:20.389 --> 04:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
time period
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
that no order for vaccination was made
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
under rsa 21-p colon 53 demonstrates the
 
04:27:31.110 --> 04:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
cautious inconsideration that is taken
 
04:27:33.030 --> 04:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
by the department when considering these
 
04:27:33.040 --> 04:27:34.309 align:start position:0%
by the department when considering these
matters

04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
matters
 
04:27:37.269 --> 04:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
passage of house bill 1271 would
 
04:27:38.950 --> 04:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
prohibit the commissioner from acting in
 
04:27:39.910 --> 04:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
the best
 
04:27:41.670 --> 04:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
interest of public health
 
04:27:43.670 --> 04:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
under existing law the commissioner has
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
the ability to act quickly during a
 
04:27:47.110 --> 04:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
04:27:49.670 --> 04:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
to rapidly address the imminent threats
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
of the health of new hampshire residents
 
04:27:53.110 --> 04:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
it is essential that the department
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
retain this authority in oversight over
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements to prevent
 
04:27:59.830 --> 04:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases during a state of
 
04:27:59.840 --> 04:28:01.830 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases during a state of
emergency

04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
prior to taking any
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
steps and making any requirements
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's careful consideration
 
04:28:11.910 --> 04:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
examining the key criteria including but
 
04:28:15.269 --> 04:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
not limited to vaccine efficacy safety
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
severity of disease likelihood of
 
04:28:20.070 --> 04:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
infection and method of transmission is
 
04:28:20.080 --> 04:28:21.189 align:start position:0%
infection and method of transmission is
taken

04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
taken
 
04:28:23.670 --> 04:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
decisions are not making light lightly
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:28:24.720 --> 04:28:26.389 align:start position:0%
in this
case

04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%

dates or session dates
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
not yet no a lot of this has to do with
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
booking of venues
 
04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%

can
 
04:33:05.109 --> 04:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
and it's not easy so
 
04:33:07.429 --> 04:33:07.439 align:start position:0%

as you can read in your copy of house

bill 1495 the definitions relative to
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
entities immunities etc are defined in
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be an anti
 
04:52:08.070 --> 04:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be anti-vaccine to
 
04:52:10.310 --> 04:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
oppose the ever expanding requirements
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
mandates and demands the majority of
 
04:52:15.190 --> 04:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
persons who oppose these mandates have a
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
narrower point
 
04:52:18.550 --> 04:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
and one that's clearly correct the
 
04:52:20.150 --> 04:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
government should not have the power to
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
force you to make a private medical
 
04:52:23.910 --> 04:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
decision that has little effect on
 
04:52:26.550 --> 04:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else your vaccination status is
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
by and large your business
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
no government can guarantee that no
 
04:52:32.550 --> 04:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
matter how desperately we want to
 
04:52:34.550 --> 04:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
mandate vaccines that people will not
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
become ill hospitalized and or die
 
04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
you should have
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't have to show an immune
 
04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
immunization passport to participate in
 
04:52:45.990 --> 04:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
social life attend public education earn
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%

we find house bill 1495 objective and
 
04:52:56.708 --> 04:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
its implementation correctly scoped
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
04:52:58.638 --> 04:52:59.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
and

04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:59.840 --> 04:53:00.628 align:start position:0%
and
a

04:53:00.628 --> 04:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:53:01.990 --> 04:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
little note
 
04:53:02.000 --> 04:53:03.270 align:start position:0%
little note
about

04:53:03.270 --> 04:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.948 --> 04:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
through 26
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
page three
 
04:53:14.638 --> 04:53:16.230 align:start position:0%
page three
um

04:53:16.230 --> 04:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:19.350 --> 04:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
looks like that was a mistake and
 
04:53:21.750 --> 04:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be omitted
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
to my understanding i i don't think you
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
have the citation correctly
 
04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
page three it will say three on the top
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the page
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
which looks like page four that's how
 
04:53:37.830 --> 04:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:37.840 --> 04:53:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:53:42.550 --> 04:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:42.560 --> 04:53:43.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:53:46.230 --> 04:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
so i just have these notes
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
uh lines 23 and it says perspective
 
04:53:51.110 --> 04:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
repeal okay that is page three sorry
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay the following are appealed
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then um there's 24 25 26
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it looks like uh it says
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
deleting draft
 
04:54:02.400 --> 04:54:05.190 align:start position:0%

04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:19.520 --> 04:55:20.390 align:start position:0%

i
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%

chairman um
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
i i actually spoke with the prime
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor about this when i read through
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i asked about those prospective
 
04:55:41.190 --> 04:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
repeal lines 23 and 24 and that
 
04:55:42.550 --> 04:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
04:55:44.310 --> 04:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
because i saw that had already taken
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
place that actually was already repealed
 
04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
so that was um when when i spoke with
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
him he said it was a drafting error on
 
04:55:52.948 --> 04:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
the part of ols and that removing on
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
page 3 lines 23 and 24
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
and then line 26
 
04:55:58.080 --> 04:55:58.948 align:start position:0%
and then line 26
would

04:55:58.948 --> 04:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:56:04.868 --> 04:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
would you believe that yes would you
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
believe that thank you
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%

connerk

04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
connerk
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thanks for
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
if we look at page three so same page
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
but up at lines nine through thirteen
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
it lays out some issues for medical
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
facilities for exemptions which talk
 
04:56:30.310 --> 04:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
about antibody levels
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
and proof of immunity or positive
 
04:56:34.628 --> 04:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
diagnostic tests
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
are you aware that those
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
issues conflict with the cms rules for
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
implementation of the cms vaccine
 
04:56:44.070 --> 04:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
mandate which would
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
place us out of compliance and therefore
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
at risk for loss of medicare and
 
04:56:49.190 --> 04:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid funding
 
04:56:50.070 --> 04:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
that it
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
may make us out of compliance for the
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
cms mandate because that's not included
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
as exemptions in that are you aware of
 
04:56:55.920 --> 04:56:56.708 align:start position:0%
as exemptions in that are you aware of
that

04:56:56.708 --> 04:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:58.150 --> 04:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
and what are your thoughts considering
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
we would have to then backfill
 
04:57:01.590 --> 04:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
starting with at least 200 million
 
04:57:03.270 --> 04:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
dollars just for the medicaid funding of
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what you mean by cns
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
may i follow up follow-up okay although
 
04:57:14.150 --> 04:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is not a question would you believe
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
that there is a cms mandate for for
 
04:57:20.390 --> 04:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
medical facilities who receive funding
 
04:57:22.948 --> 04:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
from medicare and medicaid
 
04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
that they have to have vaccination of
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
employees and they have exemptions for
 
04:57:27.360 --> 04:57:28.470 align:start position:0%
employees and they have exemptions for
religious

04:57:28.470 --> 04:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
religious
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
and for medical but they do not have it
 
04:57:30.798 --> 04:57:32.390 align:start position:0%
and for medical but they do not have it
for

04:57:32.390 --> 04:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:57:35.350 --> 04:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
antibody levels or positive diagnostic
 
04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
tests that's not part of their rules
 
04:57:40.390 --> 04:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
that have been promulgated for that
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
of course that was not an effect when
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
this was drafted of course i mean i
 
04:57:45.670 --> 04:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so
 
04:57:46.868 --> 04:57:46.878 align:start position:0%
but are you aware that at this point in
 
04:57:50.230 --> 04:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
nope no no i am not representative uh
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
chair speaking here with the question uh
 
04:57:59.350 --> 04:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
same page same section lines 10 and 11.
 
04:58:01.830 --> 04:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who has previously contracted
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
the illness
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
04:58:08.788 --> 04:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
is immune would you believe that the
 
04:58:11.910 --> 04:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
medical practices that i oversee
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
have told me that they have had people
 
04:58:14.958 --> 04:58:15.830 align:start position:0%
have told me that they have had people
who

04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:58:15.840 --> 04:58:16.628 align:start position:0%
who
have

04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:58:18.868 --> 04:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
contracted the illness
 
04:58:20.550 --> 04:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
and they are in fact not immune because
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
they got it a second time
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
so that the words in this line are
 
04:58:28.860 --> 04:58:28.870 align:start position:0%
incorrect factually would you believe
 
04:58:28.870 --> 04:58:32.550 align:start position:0%
incorrect factually would you believe

thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:59:12.550 --> 04:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
on page one there is discussion of
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
direct threat but i don't believe that
 
04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
it specifies who it is that will assess
 
04:59:25.350 --> 04:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
whether an individual uh represents a
 
04:59:27.190 --> 04:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
direct threat
 
04:59:28.230 --> 04:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
what line
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
for director what line please oh i'm
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
sorry beginning on uh
 
04:59:36.788 --> 04:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
page uh line 21 on page one okay it
 
04:59:39.030 --> 04:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
describes direct threat and at the
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
bottom of that page line 28 it describes
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:59:46.948 --> 04:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
factors which go into assessing a direct
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
threat but it doesn't say who will make
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative soloway i'm
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
merely introducing the bill
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
and uh signing in uh support but not a
 
05:00:03.360 --> 05:00:05.510 align:start position:0%
and uh signing in uh support but not a
yes

05:00:05.510 --> 05:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives um shapiro
 
05:00:08.080 --> 05:00:10.788 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives um shapiro
sponsored

05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and um
 
05:00:15.270 --> 05:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
05:00:17.990 --> 05:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
question and i realize that you're
 
05:00:19.510 --> 05:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
doing the best you can at the last
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
moments here but
 
05:00:23.190 --> 05:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
um if i'm understanding this bill
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
correctly which i may not be
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
um if we look at
 
05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
page one
 
05:00:32.230 --> 05:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
line five six and seven
 
05:00:35.750 --> 05:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it is saying that
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and all of
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
its political subdivisions and companies
 
05:00:43.030 --> 05:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
contracting with or otherwise doing
 
05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
business with the state would not not
 
05:00:48.150 --> 05:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
would basically not be allowed to
 
05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
require a vaccine
 
05:00:55.110 --> 05:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
so isn't this telling private businesses
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
that they cannot take steps
 
05:00:57.840 --> 05:00:58.948 align:start position:0%
that they cannot take steps
to

05:00:58.948 --> 05:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:12.550 --> 05:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:01:14.830 --> 05:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
and the question is isn't this
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
telling private businesses that they
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
cannot take
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
it it is a statement as it stands um
 
05:01:25.750 --> 05:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
and if if
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
represent if members of the committee
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
want to draw inferences about
 
05:01:33.430 --> 05:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
motivations i i'm not prepared to
 
05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
address that it just simply states
 
05:01:37.750 --> 05:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire and all
 
05:01:39.670 --> 05:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
the political subdivisions companies
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
contracting with or otherwise doing
 
05:01:43.110 --> 05:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
business with or receiving public funds
 
05:01:44.390 --> 05:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire or any
 
05:01:46.070 --> 05:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
of its public div subdivisions are
 
05:01:48.150 --> 05:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
prohibited from requiring
 
05:01:50.070 --> 05:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
any employee to receive
 
05:01:50.080 --> 05:01:50.868 align:start position:0%
any employee to receive
a

05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine or to possess an immunity
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:02.070 --> 05:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i was just
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
reading through information that was
 
05:02:05.670 --> 05:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
sent from the business and industry
 
05:02:09.670 --> 05:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
association the bia and this is um
 
05:02:11.990 --> 05:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
one of their legislative priorities is
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
not to have businesses um
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
prevented from
 
05:02:19.910 --> 05:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
creating safety protocols um
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
their own safety protocols they're
 
05:02:24.390 --> 05:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
against government mandates
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
are also against the government
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
mandating that private businesses cannot
 
05:02:34.470 --> 05:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
do what they need to do to keep their
 
05:02:36.628 --> 05:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
businesses safe and that's one of their
 
05:02:39.430 --> 05:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
major priorities
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
i guess the question was would you
 
05:02:44.070 --> 05:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i i would believe that i am
 
05:02:48.868 --> 05:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh
 
05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
the opinions of the bia over the last
 
05:02:55.110 --> 05:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
couple years and i completely believe
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
that they would
 
05:02:58.628 --> 05:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
make such a statement
 
05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:06.310 --> 05:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
taking the questions so follow up on
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative superiors
 
05:03:13.750 --> 05:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
um different twist to it
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
many of our
 
05:03:17.590 --> 05:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
contractors are out of state
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
um they also have to live up to their
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
state laws in which they're embedded
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
which they're
 
05:03:23.200 --> 05:03:24.948 align:start position:0%
which they're
domiciled

05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
domiciled
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
that's one question it's part of it too
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
because sometimes even federal contracts
 
05:03:31.110 --> 05:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
that many of the contractors work under
 
05:03:32.550 --> 05:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government has restrictions
 
05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
on how those funds can be utilized
 
05:03:34.798 --> 05:03:35.830 align:start position:0%
on how those funds can be utilized
so

05:03:35.830 --> 05:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't this kind of impinge upon
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
the ability for a business to run their
 
05:03:41.110 --> 05:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
business based upon the state in which
 
05:03:43.270 --> 05:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
the domiciled also based upon the
 
05:03:44.708 --> 05:03:44.718 align:start position:0%
conflict between
 
05:03:47.430 --> 05:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
this state law and the federal law
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
which could preclude them from using
 
05:03:50.948 --> 05:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
federal grants and federal dollars which
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
we would need for projects
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't comply with the
 
05:03:56.550 --> 05:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
state law at the same time with the
 
05:04:01.350 --> 05:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:03.990 --> 05:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes right brazilian i would believe that

05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in new

representing all our hospitals in new
hampshire

05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:05:26.830 --> 05:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
the association is opposed to house bill
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
1495 this legislation would establish a
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
chapter of lara stated prohibiting
 
05:05:33.830 --> 05:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
employee vaccine requirements for
 
05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
government contractors except for
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
medical providers when there is a direct
 
05:05:39.030 --> 05:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
threat present
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
however the bill itself goes well beyond
 
05:05:44.310 --> 05:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
the stated analysis and is quite broad
 
05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
there are several problems with this
 
05:05:48.150 --> 05:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
bill first this bill is in direct
 
05:05:49.990 --> 05:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
conflict with the federal requirement
 
05:05:52.150 --> 05:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
for government contractors
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that their employees are
 
05:05:55.670 --> 05:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinated that requirement is currently
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
held up in court in a court challenge
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
and is likely not going to be settled
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
for months that is one valid reason to
 
05:06:03.430 --> 05:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
not pass this legislation the confusion
 
05:06:05.190 --> 05:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
and potential conflict that likely will
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
result between state and federal laws
 
05:06:08.830 --> 05:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
and regulations is significant and
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
noteworthy while the bill before you
 
05:06:13.590 --> 05:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
reference employees that contract with
 
05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire the concern
 
05:06:16.788 --> 05:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
is companies that have contracts with
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
the state may also and very likely do
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
have contracts with federal government
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
hence the conflict further the bill is
 
05:06:25.830 --> 05:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
not consistent with the federal centers
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
for medicare and medicaid services cms
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
regulations relative to employee
 
05:06:32.470 --> 05:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements the citations
 
05:06:33.910 --> 05:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill before you reference the
 
05:06:36.310 --> 05:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
equal opportunity employment commission
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
eeoc while relevant to all employers
 
05:06:40.390 --> 05:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
including healthcare facilities the
 
05:06:42.390 --> 05:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
definition of direct threat is not
 
05:06:44.390 --> 05:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
pertinent in the context of vaccine
 
05:06:44.400 --> 05:06:45.670 align:start position:0%
pertinent in the context of vaccine
requirements

05:06:45.670 --> 05:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:06:47.030 --> 05:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
the exemption
 
05:06:49.590 --> 05:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
section of the bill and i think
 
05:06:51.430 --> 05:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
someone's already pointed this out page
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
3 lines 1 through 17 is also very
 
05:06:54.240 --> 05:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
3 lines 1 through 17 is also very
problematic

05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
specifically lines 2 and 3 are again
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
related to the eeoc not the federal cms
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement
 
05:07:03.910 --> 05:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
in fact the exemptions listed are in
 
05:07:06.628 --> 05:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
direct violation of the cms requirement
 
05:07:08.708 --> 05:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
so again if the bill were to pass there
 
05:07:10.390 --> 05:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be a direct conflict between the
 
05:07:11.830 --> 05:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
state and federal requirements for
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals and health care providers
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
that accept medicare and medicaid
 
05:07:17.350 --> 05:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
funding this would put federal and state
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
matching fed medicaid funding at risk
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
for all hospitals and health care
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
providers this is a risk that should not
 
05:07:23.990 --> 05:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
be ignored
 
05:07:25.830 --> 05:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals new hampshire hospitals must
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
follow cms requirements as i think you
 
05:07:30.230 --> 05:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
are well aware
 
05:07:31.830 --> 05:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
and that all providers that accept
 
05:07:33.910 --> 05:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds must require that their
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
employees receive receive the cova
 
05:07:39.030 --> 05:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine with exemptions for medical and
 
05:07:41.670 --> 05:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
religious considerations the bill before
 
05:07:43.350 --> 05:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
you is in direct conflict with this
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
federal requirement and the u.s supreme
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
court has ruled a couple weeks ago on
 
05:07:48.550 --> 05:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
this requirement and the court's
 
05:07:51.030 --> 05:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
position and it stands it is not being
 
05:07:53.430 --> 05:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
appealed this is the highest court of
 
05:07:54.628 --> 05:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
the land
 
05:07:56.550 --> 05:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
is that the federal government does in
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
fact have the authority to impose this
 
05:07:58.400 --> 05:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
fact have the authority to impose this
requirement

05:07:59.830 --> 05:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
and requiring vaccinations of health
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
care workers from communicable diseases
 
05:08:06.708 --> 05:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
is not new to hospitals in new hampshire
 
05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
and i just listed all the various
 
05:08:09.360 --> 05:08:10.788 align:start position:0%
and i just listed all the various
vaccines

05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
that hospital vaccination requirements
 
05:08:15.750 --> 05:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
that hospitals have for a number of
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases
 
05:08:19.910 --> 05:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
and we do believe it's the right it is
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
the absolute right thing to do for
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our patients our
 
05:08:26.390 --> 05:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
staff and citizens of new hampshire
 
05:08:28.708 --> 05:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
and as i have stated previously but to
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
be on record the vast majority of
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
hospital staff have been vaccinated
 
05:08:35.670 --> 05:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
against coven 19 or have received
 
05:08:37.510 --> 05:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions and we've heard from many
 
05:08:38.948 --> 05:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
health care workers who support the
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement to protect their
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
health and that of their patients the
 
05:08:44.948 --> 05:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
bill before you
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
as stated in the fiscal note could also
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
have negative economic impact on the
 
05:08:50.550 --> 05:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and result in
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
contract disputes that could result in
 
05:08:54.390 --> 05:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
increased litigation this is very
 
05:08:55.990 --> 05:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
concerning and should give the committee
 
05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
pause when considering this bill and the
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
implications to the state for all these
 
05:09:02.070 --> 05:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
reasons the hospital association is in
 
05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to this bill and we
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to find it in
 
05:09:08.070 --> 05:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman pearson thank you for
 
05:09:19.590 --> 05:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question and this um may be
 
05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
happening i i don't know so that's why
 
05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm asking this question the last um
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
person representative soloway asked a
 
05:09:30.310 --> 05:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
question about the threat um
 
05:09:30.320 --> 05:09:32.230 align:start position:0%
question about the threat um
determination

05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
determination
 
05:09:35.350 --> 05:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
my curiosity question is when a hospital
 
05:09:38.230 --> 05:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
mandates or cms mandates that all
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the employees be vaccinated does that
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
include the groundskeepers does that
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
include the bookkeepers who might work
 
05:09:47.270 --> 05:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
in a different building
 
05:09:50.708 --> 05:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
the electrician that's putting up lights
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
where there's no patients around are all
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
of those people
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
also even if they're private contractors
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
are all of those also under that mandate
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
so for i can speak to the hospitals um
 
05:10:05.910 --> 05:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
and they all their employees um unless
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are they have
 
05:10:10.390 --> 05:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
qualified for an exemption um they they
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
are required to meet the vaccination
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
requirement because if they are working
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
say in dietary
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
or in grounds keepers whatever they may
 
05:10:22.948 --> 05:10:22.958 align:start position:0%
and in fact still come in contact with
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
patients and
 
05:10:27.430 --> 05:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
employees and so it is a it is a uniform
 
05:10:27.440 --> 05:10:28.628 align:start position:0%
employees and so it is a it is a uniform
across

05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
across
 
05:10:31.750 --> 05:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
as far as contractors i think there are
 
05:10:31.760 --> 05:10:33.030 align:start position:0%
as far as contractors i think there are
some

05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
i believe that if you're coming into the
 
05:10:37.590 --> 05:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
hospital that you do nee as a contractor
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
say that you're providing um
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know a mobile mri and you come
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know twice a week or whatever um
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
those contractors um also must follow um
 
05:10:49.350 --> 05:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
that are coming into the hospital must
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
follow if you have a contract with the
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
hospital you must also follow the
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirement
 
05:10:59.190 --> 05:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes um thank you
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
i think that where my brain is going is
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily those contractors who
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
are going to have direct contact with
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
05:11:10.230 --> 05:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking more the people that i mean
 
05:11:12.628 --> 05:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
the groundskeepers
 
05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
rarely have contact with the patient
 
05:11:18.788 --> 05:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
the business offices things like that
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
and so when you look at um
 
05:11:23.830 --> 05:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
the risk assessment
 
05:11:25.590 --> 05:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
for those people
 
05:11:25.600 --> 05:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
for those people
would

05:11:26.550 --> 05:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
does it really have as high of a risk as
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
it does
 
05:11:33.430 --> 05:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know working up the ladder dietary
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
nurses doctors
 
05:11:37.830 --> 05:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
so um i think it's important to note
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
this direct threat is a eeoc this is not
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
part of the cms requirement this this
 
05:11:46.230 --> 05:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
this language in here is not part of the
 
05:11:48.310 --> 05:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
cms requirement
 
05:11:48.320 --> 05:11:49.510 align:start position:0%
cms requirement
so

05:11:49.510 --> 05:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:11:51.510 --> 05:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
i can't really address how they're
 
05:11:55.030 --> 05:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
defining it the cms requirement is is
 
05:11:57.190 --> 05:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
is pretty straightforward
 
05:12:00.628 --> 05:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
that if you are accepting me if you are
 
05:12:03.190 --> 05:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
accepting federal funds you must fault
 
05:12:04.868 --> 05:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
you must have your employees must be
 
05:12:04.878 --> 05:12:06.550 align:start position:0%
you must have your employees must be
vaccinated

05:12:06.550 --> 05:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
05:12:08.550 --> 05:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
with with the exceptions of medical and
 
05:12:08.560 --> 05:12:09.510 align:start position:0%
with with the exceptions of medical and
religious

05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
religious
 
05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions and they do have policies
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
which i actually owe you um i think um
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
and i apologize i've been a little busy
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i haven't had a chance to get that to
 
05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
you but i think you had asked me last
 
05:12:20.788 --> 05:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
week about the
 
05:12:23.190 --> 05:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
what the policies um include for medical
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
and religious and i was going to show
 
05:12:26.550 --> 05:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
you a form um i'm just i'm pulling that
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
together i will send that to the entire
 
05:12:28.080 --> 05:12:29.430 align:start position:0%
together i will send that to the entire
committee

05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:12:31.510 --> 05:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is
 
05:12:37.750 --> 05:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
about your statement on the supreme
 
05:12:40.470 --> 05:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
court um i'm i'm not sure if you
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if you've read the reports
 
05:12:43.350 --> 05:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
on it or if you actually read the
 
05:12:45.670 --> 05:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
opinion because the opinion wasn't a
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
ruling it was simply staying the
 
05:12:50.550 --> 05:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
injunction so saying that there is merit
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
and they're continuing on before they
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
come to a final decision and i'm curious
 
05:12:54.638 --> 05:12:55.510 align:start position:0%
come to a final decision and i'm curious
if

05:12:55.510 --> 05:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:12:57.030 --> 05:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
knowing that it's an opinion and not a
 
05:12:58.868 --> 05:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
ruling changes any of your opinions
 
05:13:00.868 --> 05:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
there my understanding is the white
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
house asked that this be considered by
 
05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
the supreme court they wanted a ruling
 
05:13:08.070 --> 05:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
and they um so
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that's the
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
ruling that was stated i i think you
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
there's also the government um
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
contractor that that one is being a um
 
05:13:18.628 --> 05:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
is in
 
05:13:20.470 --> 05:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
appeal right now or not appeal but it's
 
05:13:22.390 --> 05:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the it's in the lower courts right
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
now but um i i am not under the
 
05:13:27.990 --> 05:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and i had checked um
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
with the american hospital association
 
05:13:31.910 --> 05:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's not our understanding that the cms
 
05:13:34.230 --> 05:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
requirement is being further challenged
 
05:13:35.910 --> 05:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
so i
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
that is not my understanding
 
05:13:38.480 --> 05:13:39.830 align:start position:0%
that is not my understanding
follow-up

05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:13:42.628 --> 05:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
my follow-up would be
 
05:13:44.310 --> 05:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand that this is
 
05:13:47.430 --> 05:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
simply staying the injunctions and that
 
05:13:49.990 --> 05:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
that is not a final ruling but i guess
 
05:13:50.000 --> 05:13:51.030 align:start position:0%
that is not a final ruling but i guess
um

05:13:51.030 --> 05:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:52.708 --> 05:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
your it's your understanding that
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be an actual ruling
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
on this and that the opinion is all
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's necessary from the supreme court
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
in order to make these ground keepers
 
05:14:04.230 --> 05:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
i believe the supreme court um has the
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
final say and that was the under that
 
05:14:12.230 --> 05:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
was why the the
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
administration asked them to rule on the
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
cms mandate that's
 
05:14:19.830 --> 05:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and follow-up
 
05:14:21.750 --> 05:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
and your your understanding is that they
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
have an actual ruling and not just an
 
05:14:24.320 --> 05:14:25.670 align:start position:0%
have an actual ruling and not just an
opinion

05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
05:14:27.190 --> 05:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
from the supreme i'm not a lawyer
 
05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the cms manda the
 
05:14:35.670 --> 05:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
cms requirement stands and and the
 
05:14:37.830 --> 05:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals and health care providers are
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
implementing them throughout the country
 
05:14:42.550 --> 05:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
the supreme court does get to make the
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
final ruling but not everything they say
 
05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
is their final ruling
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:14:52.868 --> 05:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
would agree that it's still pending
 
05:14:54.550 --> 05:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
from how i read it
 
05:14:56.550 --> 05:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
05:14:56.560 --> 05:14:59.110 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
snow

05:14:59.110 --> 05:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:00.628 --> 05:15:00.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:15:03.030 --> 05:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
i i just to follow up on what
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
one of my colleagues asked earlier many
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
of these hospitals and
 
05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
companies have contractors
 
05:15:13.350 --> 05:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
where i live we have a contract with a
 
05:15:15.590 --> 05:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
large groundskeeping company the same
 
05:15:17.830 --> 05:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
people don't come all the time depends
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
on who's available does that mean that
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
every employee of that groundskeeping
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
company for example would have to
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
receive this
 
05:15:24.958 --> 05:15:25.910 align:start position:0%
receive this
or

05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:15:27.190 --> 05:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to have a
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
contract same with
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
if you have to call it an electrician to
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
fix an electrical problem
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
again um depending on the policy of the
 
05:15:38.470 --> 05:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
hospital but um and i have not seen the
 
05:15:40.550 --> 05:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
the actual policies but my understanding
 
05:15:42.788 --> 05:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
is if they are coming into the hospital
 
05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
to provide services
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
that those that are coming in must be um
 
05:15:50.230 --> 05:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
have proof that they are vaccinated
 
05:15:52.470 --> 05:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
by or or they have an exemption they
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
have received an exception by in
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
do you mean into the building or well
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
they provide they're providing services
 
05:16:03.110 --> 05:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
to that facility even if it's only
 
05:16:05.590 --> 05:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
outside on the grounds
 
05:16:05.600 --> 05:16:06.708 align:start position:0%
outside on the grounds
i

05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.990 --> 05:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative leon um thank you mr
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um this actually raised a
 
05:16:18.070 --> 05:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
question for me do you know if that
 
05:16:20.550 --> 05:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
includes contractors who are only
 
05:16:22.470 --> 05:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
virtual and never set foot on the
 
05:16:22.480 --> 05:16:23.590 align:start position:0%
virtual and never set foot on the
property

05:16:23.590 --> 05:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:16:26.310 --> 05:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
it depends on the policy of the hospital
 
05:16:26.320 --> 05:16:28.708 align:start position:0%
it depends on the policy of the hospital
representative

05:16:28.708 --> 05:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
right michael actually i pulled up the
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
full-time telework employees are
 
05:16:33.920 --> 05:16:35.190 align:start position:0%
full-time telework employees are
exempted

05:16:35.190 --> 05:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
exempted
 
05:16:38.310 --> 05:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
so that is they are not included
 
05:16:39.590 --> 05:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:16:44.868 --> 05:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much
 
05:16:48.788 --> 05:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
and you know um
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
my dad always said you learn a lot more
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
about a person you think you are talking
 
05:16:55.030 --> 05:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
about when you actually talk to that
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
person so since we've been talking about
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
what bia thinks i'd like to call uh
 
05:17:02.948 --> 05:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
david is it janae
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
juve sorry
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
oh thank you so much it would even be
 
05:17:22.150 --> 05:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
better if you had the mic on
 
05:17:24.070 --> 05:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
i won't repeat all that
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is dave
 
05:17:29.110 --> 05:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
giuve i don't often appear before this
 
05:17:31.030 --> 05:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh but i am senior vice
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
president for public policy for the
 
05:17:35.510 --> 05:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
business and industry association we
 
05:17:37.750 --> 05:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
serve as new hampshire's statewide
 
05:17:41.030 --> 05:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce we have 400 plus
 
05:17:42.788 --> 05:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
employer members
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
with over 80 000 employees in the state
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm here today in opposition to the bill
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
i won't go on and on about it because
 
05:17:51.990 --> 05:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
many of the points i wanted to make were
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
made by ms minahan but i do want to make
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
sure that the committee understands
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
that passing this legislation would put
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
some employers in the state in a
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
extremely awkward position of
 
05:18:08.708 --> 05:18:08.718 align:start position:0%
either needing to comply with the
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
federal mandate or
 
05:18:13.750 --> 05:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
comply with the state law they wouldn't
 
05:18:15.830 --> 05:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
be able to do both they are in conflict
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
with each other
 
05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
last year on legislation
 
05:18:23.110 --> 05:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
that on a completely separate topic but
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
it did deal with
 
05:18:26.310 --> 05:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
private sector companies that had
 
05:18:28.390 --> 05:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
contracts with the state
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
i checked with commissioner arlinghaus
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
from our department of administrative
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
services because i was curious how many
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
companies were we talking about and
 
05:18:39.110 --> 05:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
interestingly he didn't know for certain
 
05:18:41.110 --> 05:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
but he said it was in the thousands so
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of companies that would
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
be impacted by this
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
like ms minihan i am not an attorney but
 
05:18:51.670 --> 05:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
i do want to give some thoughts on the
 
05:18:54.390 --> 05:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
subject of of the federal mandate and
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
what the supreme court did there were
 
05:18:56.638 --> 05:18:57.750 align:start position:0%
what the supreme court did there were
three

05:18:57.750 --> 05:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:18:57.760 --> 05:18:58.708 align:start position:0%
three
separate

05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
separate
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
federal mandates the one we heard the
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
most about initially was for private
 
05:19:05.350 --> 05:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
sector companies that had a hundred
 
05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
employees or more
 
05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
the court struck down the emergency
 
05:19:14.070 --> 05:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
implementation of that mandate
 
05:19:16.150 --> 05:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
so i would say that has gone away
 
05:19:20.070 --> 05:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
temporarily osha is still working on the
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
normal schedule for that mandate so i
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
think it is possible it would come back
 
05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
someday but not in the immediate future
 
05:19:31.590 --> 05:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
the second mandate applied to private
 
05:19:34.550 --> 05:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
sector companies that had con federal
 
05:19:34.560 --> 05:19:36.070 align:start position:0%
sector companies that had con federal
contracts

05:19:36.070 --> 05:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
05:19:38.230 --> 05:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
and the court
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
allowed that mandate to be stayed by a
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
lower court that doesn't mean it goes
 
05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
away it doesn't mean it can be
 
05:19:47.910 --> 05:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
implemented it means it's in a holding
 
05:19:50.230 --> 05:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
pattern until that lower court renders a
 
05:19:52.628 --> 05:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
decision and then that could be appealed
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court
 
05:19:56.708 --> 05:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
the third mandate is the one that you
 
05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
folks had some conversation about
 
05:20:00.470 --> 05:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
relating to those
 
05:20:02.470 --> 05:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
employers that receive medicaid or
 
05:20:05.910 --> 05:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
medicare funding and i don't know to me
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know i'm sure there is probably a
 
05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
legal difference between a dis rendering
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
a decision and
 
05:20:12.868 --> 05:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
rendering an opinion
 
05:20:15.750 --> 05:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
but the fact is having rendered either
 
05:20:18.470 --> 05:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
the opinion or the decision that mandate
 
05:20:20.708 --> 05:20:20.718 align:start position:0%
is in place and is being
 
05:20:20.718 --> 05:20:21.590 align:start position:0%
is in place and is being
um

05:20:21.590 --> 05:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:21.600 --> 05:20:22.470 align:start position:0%
um
uh

05:20:22.470 --> 05:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:20:25.510 --> 05:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
it is requiring employers
 
05:20:29.510 --> 05:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
in those areas to comply with it
 
05:20:29.520 --> 05:20:31.350 align:start position:0%
in those areas to comply with it
the

05:20:31.350 --> 05:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:20:34.868 --> 05:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
other area i do want to touch on um
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
relates more to
 
05:20:40.310 --> 05:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
philosophy than the practical impacts of
 
05:20:42.390 --> 05:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation and the philosophy from
 
05:20:44.470 --> 05:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
the bia is
 
05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
that we don't think it's appropriate we
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
think it is overreached by the state to
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
try and dictate to private sector
 
05:20:54.070 --> 05:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
employers what they should or should not
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
be doing in terms of providing a safe
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
and healthy work environment for their
 
05:21:01.910 --> 05:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
employees so mr chair i appreciate the
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
 
05:21:05.910 --> 05:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to try and answer any
 
05:21:05.920 --> 05:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to try and answer any
questions

05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.470 --> 05:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
all right i
 
05:21:18.628 --> 05:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
taking this question
 
05:21:23.430 --> 05:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's the second time maybe even the
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
third time i've heard
 
05:21:29.030 --> 05:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
an employer having a safe environment
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
i also heard the term
 
05:21:31.360 --> 05:21:32.868 align:start position:0%
i also heard the term
immune

05:21:32.868 --> 05:21:32.878 align:start position:0%
immune
 
05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
on page three shot down because
 
05:21:38.548 --> 05:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
people have who've had covid
 
05:21:38.558 --> 05:21:39.430 align:start position:0%
people have who've had covid
have

05:21:39.430 --> 05:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:21:41.670 --> 05:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
had a reoccurrence of covid so are they
 
05:21:44.470 --> 05:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
really immune which goes back to natural
 
05:21:44.480 --> 05:21:46.830 align:start position:0%
really immune which goes back to natural
immunity

05:21:46.830 --> 05:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
05:21:50.070 --> 05:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
um the the the vaccines from everything
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
that i've heard in the last month and a
 
05:21:51.600 --> 05:21:52.548 align:start position:0%
that i've heard in the last month and a
half

05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
half
 
05:21:56.548 --> 05:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
do not guarantee a safe work environment
 
05:21:58.948 --> 05:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
is my fact natural immunity may be
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
safer than uh than the vaccine
 
05:22:05.350 --> 05:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
so are we really preventing
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
employers from
 
05:22:09.030 --> 05:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
a safe
 
05:22:11.270 --> 05:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
safe work environment by by
 
05:22:13.030 --> 05:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
implementing this bill or any bill
 
05:22:14.470 --> 05:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
similar to it
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
well i mentioned i'm not a lawyer i'm
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
not a doctor either so i'm not really
 
05:22:19.510 --> 05:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
prepared to
 
05:22:19.520 --> 05:22:21.910 align:start position:0%
prepared to
um

05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
debate the effectiveness of the
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination i would say what you are
 
05:22:27.910 --> 05:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
doing is preventing employers from
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:38.708 --> 05:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearson and thank you
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this is a
 
05:22:44.230 --> 05:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
business one but maybe also a legal one
 
05:22:47.110 --> 05:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
you're not a lawyer you're not a doctor
 
05:22:52.230 --> 05:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:52.240 --> 05:22:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
if a contractor
 
05:22:56.830 --> 05:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
has a license with the
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
facility all of a sudden this mandate
 
05:23:02.470 --> 05:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.830 --> 05:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
they then are required to have all their
 
05:23:07.350 --> 05:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
employees that are going to be working
 
05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
which may be all of their employees
 
05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
working in this facility to have them
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:17.670 --> 05:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
if they choose not to have them
 
05:23:20.628 --> 05:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
vaccinated is there any legal recourse
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
they have because they feel that
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
their contract with that facility has
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
had undue pressure put on it
 
05:23:29.760 --> 05:23:30.470 align:start position:0%
had undue pressure put on it
to

05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:23:32.708 --> 05:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
for to comply with something that was
 
05:23:34.470 --> 05:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
not in place when their contract was
 
05:23:34.480 --> 05:23:38.948 align:start position:0%
not in place when their contract was
made

05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:42.628 --> 05:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
um i i don't really feel well qual i
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
think it's an excellent question i don't
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
feel well qualified to answer it because
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert on contract law
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that while the
 
05:23:55.430 --> 05:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
federal mandate for government
 
05:23:58.628 --> 05:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
contractors was in place for the short
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
period of time that it was in place
 
05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
it not only implied it not only applied
 
05:24:05.350 --> 05:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
to the company that had the federal
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
contract it also applied to
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh smaller companies that may be
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
providing them with
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
the widgets that go into the making of
 
05:24:17.590 --> 05:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
the product for the government contract
 
05:24:19.910 --> 05:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
if those widgets were used
 
05:24:22.708 --> 05:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
in in the product that that the
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
government contract was about
 
05:24:24.798 --> 05:24:25.910 align:start position:0%
government contract was about
so

05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:25.920 --> 05:24:27.190 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:24:27.190 --> 05:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
that concept was certainly introduced i
 
05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
know that doesn't really answer your
 
05:24:32.868 --> 05:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
question about
 
05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
whether it's legal or whether there
 
05:24:36.708 --> 05:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
would be the basis for a lawsuit i'm
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
just not really qualified to answer that
 
05:24:39.120 --> 05:24:40.948 align:start position:0%
just not really qualified to answer that
follow-up

05:24:40.948 --> 05:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:24:43.750 --> 05:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
yes do you think thank you do you think
 
05:24:45.430 --> 05:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
05:24:48.310 --> 05:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
company that is making the widgets are
 
05:24:51.190 --> 05:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
are um a threat to the health of the
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
people in the facility
 
05:24:53.680 --> 05:24:56.310 align:start position:0%
people in the facility
i

05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
i don't really have the ability to
 
05:25:00.628 --> 05:25:00.638 align:start position:0%
answer that either because i don't know
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
if they have
 
05:25:04.390 --> 05:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
employees that are are
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh going into the workplace of of the of
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
the larger company with the contract i
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:14.230 --> 05:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know in some ways i have to be
 
05:25:16.390 --> 05:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
honest it doesn't really matter very
 
05:25:19.270 --> 05:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
much what i think it matters what the
 
05:25:22.150 --> 05:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
law is and i guess that's part of my
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
problem with this legislation is you're
 
05:25:27.990 --> 05:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
putting employers
 
05:25:30.150 --> 05:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
at risk of not being able to follow
 
05:25:32.390 --> 05:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
federal law and state law at the same
 
05:25:32.400 --> 05:25:34.788 align:start position:0%
federal law and state law at the same
time

05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.270 --> 05:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:25:39.510 --> 05:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative acton thank you mr chair
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
05:25:45.510 --> 05:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen in in this situation of covet
 
05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:51.030 --> 05:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
coordinate i won't use the word
 
05:25:53.190 --> 05:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
collusion it's coordination between the
 
05:25:53.200 --> 05:25:54.230 align:start position:0%
collusion it's coordination between the
government

05:25:54.230 --> 05:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:25:55.910 --> 05:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
and big business
 
05:25:55.920 --> 05:25:56.948 align:start position:0%
and big business
to

05:25:56.948 --> 05:25:56.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:25:59.110 --> 05:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
stifle free speech
 
05:26:02.310 --> 05:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
and um so the people i represent who are
 
05:26:04.230 --> 05:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
the people not big business
 
05:26:06.788 --> 05:26:06.798 align:start position:0%
not government are extremely
 
05:26:09.030 --> 05:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
05:26:09.040 --> 05:26:11.830 align:start position:0%
concerned that
the

05:26:11.830 --> 05:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:13.670 --> 05:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
the grouping of
 
05:26:16.230 --> 05:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
this new grouping is is shutting us down
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
we can't even discuss this without being
 
05:26:20.948 --> 05:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
de-platformed by facebook
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh various um
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
big tech um businesses so
 
05:26:27.270 --> 05:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
can you at least admit that there's some
 
05:26:29.910 --> 05:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
basis for pushback because of this kind
 
05:26:29.920 --> 05:26:31.030 align:start position:0%
basis for pushback because of this kind
of

05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:26:33.030 --> 05:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
this kind of behavior that's going on
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
between business and government
 
05:26:38.150 --> 05:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
well i'd have to respectfully
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
but strenuously disagree with your
 
05:26:42.708 --> 05:26:42.718 align:start position:0%
characterization that this is some type
 
05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
of collusion between government and big
 
05:26:48.390 --> 05:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
business i will acknowledge
 
05:26:48.400 --> 05:26:49.350 align:start position:0%
business i will acknowledge
that

05:26:49.350 --> 05:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:52.390 --> 05:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's an emotional issue on both sides
 
05:26:52.400 --> 05:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
it's an emotional issue on both sides
and

05:26:53.510 --> 05:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
i understand that those who
 
05:26:58.628 --> 05:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
either don't want to receive a
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
vaccination or don't believe that they
 
05:27:03.270 --> 05:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
work have strongly held feelings
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
but i'd also like to remind the
 
05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
committee that there are a lot of other
 
05:27:08.788 --> 05:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
people who work in these very same
 
05:27:11.430 --> 05:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
places of business that also have strong
 
05:27:13.270 --> 05:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
feelings about wanting to work in a
 
05:27:14.548 --> 05:27:14.558 align:start position:0%
place that's as
 
05:27:14.558 --> 05:27:15.430 align:start position:0%
place that's as
is

05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:27:17.750 --> 05:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
healthy and safety as reasonably
 
05:27:20.150 --> 05:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
possible so
 
05:27:22.390 --> 05:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
i would
 
05:27:24.070 --> 05:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
request that you think about everybody
 
05:27:26.070 --> 05:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's in a place at work and not just
 
05:27:27.350 --> 05:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
05:27:27.360 --> 05:27:28.390 align:start position:0%
focus on
one

05:27:28.390 --> 05:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:27:30.548 --> 05:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
population that may or may not want to
 
05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
have vaccinations
 
05:27:35.590 --> 05:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
05:27:35.600 --> 05:27:36.708 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
chairman

05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:27:38.070 --> 05:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
would you believe that some of the
 
05:27:40.070 --> 05:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
people that have a problem with these
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
policies are actually that fully
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated fully boosted themselves and
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
they're thankful for the choice to be
 
05:27:47.510 --> 05:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but they oppose these
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
mandates because they believe it's
 
05:27:48.958 --> 05:27:50.230 align:start position:0%
mandates because they believe it's
coercive

05:27:50.230 --> 05:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
coercive
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
so the opposition is not just those who
 
05:27:55.030 --> 05:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to be vaccinated
 
05:27:56.948 --> 05:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
yes i would believe that but i would
 
05:27:58.708 --> 05:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
also say that they aren't the ones who
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
would be impacted by a an employer
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
mandate for vaccination
 
05:28:03.440 --> 05:28:04.948 align:start position:0%
mandate for vaccination
follow-up

05:28:04.948 --> 05:28:04.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
do you believe that if we can mandate
 
05:28:08.788 --> 05:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
these types of things for the health and
 
05:28:11.110 --> 05:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
safety of people in a business that
 
05:28:13.350 --> 05:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
future mandates might impact things
 
05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
other than vaccination
 
05:28:16.080 --> 05:28:17.110 align:start position:0%
other than vaccination
i

05:28:17.110 --> 05:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:28:19.670 --> 05:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
think that would be speculative and i
 
05:28:21.270 --> 05:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
have been around long enough to know
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
that whenever a situation like that or a
 
05:28:26.230 --> 05:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
proposal like that comes up there will
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
be full debate about it
 
05:28:36.070 --> 05:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:37.510 --> 05:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:28:39.270 --> 05:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:28:41.430 --> 05:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
05:28:41.440 --> 05:28:44.150 align:start position:0%
do you have
any

05:28:44.150 --> 05:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:44.160 --> 05:28:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
statistics

05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
05:28:45.840 --> 05:28:46.788 align:start position:0%
statistics
on

05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:28:48.868 --> 05:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
companies that
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
weren't mandated before but now are
 
05:28:52.548 --> 05:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
let's say you've got a landscaping
 
05:28:52.558 --> 05:28:53.670 align:start position:0%
let's say you've got a landscaping
company

05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
company
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
and you've got 20 employees and these
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
guys are just lawn mowers and they mulch
 
05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
and they mulch and mule
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
and so now all of a sudden
 
05:29:04.470 --> 05:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
you've got this crew and it's tough
 
05:29:06.470 --> 05:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
getting these crews i mean i know some
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
businesses have just gone out because
 
05:29:10.150 --> 05:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough guys to mulch and
 
05:29:10.160 --> 05:29:11.270 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough guys to mulch and
mull

05:29:11.270 --> 05:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
mull
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
so let's say you've got and these crews
 
05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
tend to not want to
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
go get a vaccine
 
05:29:18.628 --> 05:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
i mean truthfully
 
05:29:20.628 --> 05:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
so now all of a sudden the owner of this
 
05:29:20.638 --> 05:29:22.470 align:start position:0%
so now all of a sudden the owner of this
business

05:29:22.470 --> 05:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
05:29:25.270 --> 05:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
has to say to his 20 guys okay you guys
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
you all have to go get a vaccine in
 
05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
order for me to have this contract
 
05:29:32.470 --> 05:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
working for this particular
 
05:29:34.788 --> 05:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
company hospital whatever
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
would i would say it would have to be a
 
05:29:38.548 --> 05:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
medical facility of some sort right
 
05:29:40.628 --> 05:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
because that's the mandate
 
05:29:40.638 --> 05:29:41.590 align:start position:0%
because that's the mandate
now

05:29:41.590 --> 05:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
these guys
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
quit now the company is in real jeopardy
 
05:29:49.830 --> 05:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
do you have do have you had that
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
situation occur do you have any
 
05:29:54.788 --> 05:29:54.798 align:start position:0%
anecdotal uh evidence do you do you have
 
05:29:57.670 --> 05:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
any any type of figures um not
 
05:29:59.670 --> 05:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
specifically relating to the landscapers
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i can tell you
 
05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
at the for the short period of time
 
05:30:05.910 --> 05:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
where it appeared that there would be a
 
05:30:07.830 --> 05:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
federal mandate on private sector
 
05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
employers of 100 employees or more
 
05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of our members
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know the percentage but it was
 
05:30:15.120 --> 05:30:16.390 align:start position:0%
i don't know the percentage but it was
significant

05:30:16.390 --> 05:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
significant
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
they were extremely concerned about
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
implementing that policy because they
 
05:30:22.548 --> 05:30:22.558 align:start position:0%
thought they would lose employees and
 
05:30:24.230 --> 05:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
and this is a pretty tough work
 
05:30:25.990 --> 05:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
environment anyway in terms of finding
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
employees so
 
05:30:29.750 --> 05:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't have a study i can tell you
 
05:30:31.510 --> 05:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
though that that was
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
a significant concern for many of our
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
members at the point where that hundred
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
employee mandate
 
05:30:39.350 --> 05:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
looked like it was going to be
 
05:30:39.360 --> 05:30:40.548 align:start position:0%
looked like it was going to be
implemented

05:30:40.548 --> 05:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
05:30:43.350 --> 05:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative knurk
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
this is actually a point of order i i
 
05:30:46.628 --> 05:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
don't really think we should be trying
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
to discuss the issues about whether the
 
05:30:50.948 --> 05:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
cms mandate is correct or not
 
05:30:53.430 --> 05:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's there our job is looking at this
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill which is in conflict with the cms
 
05:30:57.510 --> 05:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
mandate and how to resolve that but
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
we're spending a lot of time talking
 
05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
about how that should be changed and we
 
05:31:02.470 --> 05:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
have not got the power to do that so i
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
would suggest that we would
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
defer and move on and actually focus on
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of us
 
05:31:12.230 --> 05:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
that was my thought let's try that
 
05:31:15.030 --> 05:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
any questions on the bill in front of us
 
05:31:19.590 --> 05:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:27.270 --> 05:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
and the chair calls up aaron and tom
 
05:31:31.350 --> 05:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
fallon they these ass for two minutes so
 
05:31:34.470 --> 05:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
the group of two gets four
 
05:31:37.110 --> 05:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
05:31:39.430 --> 05:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
we will owe you one for your future
 
05:31:39.440 --> 05:31:40.868 align:start position:0%
we will owe you one for your future
visit

05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
visit
 
05:31:55.510 --> 05:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
and your friend
 
05:31:59.910 --> 05:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's rafferty hi
 
05:32:01.030 --> 05:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:32:04.230 --> 05:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
yeah he's tired of all of this so but to
 
05:32:06.070 --> 05:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
get to it uh
 
05:32:08.150 --> 05:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about individual
 
05:32:10.230 --> 05:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
freedoms with this uh
 
05:32:13.190 --> 05:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
proposed bill we're not talking about
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's it's business rights but
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's an individual's freedom freedom to
 
05:32:17.520 --> 05:32:18.628 align:start position:0%
it's an individual's freedom freedom to
work

05:32:18.628 --> 05:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
and to work without coercion
 
05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
it's great to say
 
05:32:25.190 --> 05:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
medical and religious exemptions
 
05:32:27.510 --> 05:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
if they're granted
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
people can i know of people that have
 
05:32:29.680 --> 05:32:30.868 align:start position:0%
people can i know of people that have
filed

05:32:30.868 --> 05:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
filed
 
05:32:32.788 --> 05:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
religious and medical medical exemptions
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
and had them denied
 
05:32:36.310 --> 05:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
and have lost their jobs
 
05:32:36.320 --> 05:32:37.430 align:start position:0%
and have lost their jobs
and

05:32:37.430 --> 05:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of the individual residents
 
05:32:41.190 --> 05:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and the individual
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is something we have to focus
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
on well i agree that we have to comply
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
with federal uh mandates
 
05:32:51.670 --> 05:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
do we applau do
 
05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
it what is law and what is opinion when
 
05:32:56.230 --> 05:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
we look at as as you re uh
 
05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier with regards to the
 
05:32:59.430 --> 05:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
05:33:02.470 --> 05:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
and where do we roll over and as as new
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire live free and die and say okay
 
05:33:07.830 --> 05:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
they said so so we're going to do it
 
05:33:09.910 --> 05:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
where do we question and to and have new
 
05:33:11.190 --> 05:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire rights
 
05:33:14.310 --> 05:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
so speaking for people that i've seen
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
lose their jobs
 
05:33:18.548 --> 05:33:18.558 align:start position:0%
that may not have the courage to come
 
05:33:24.070 --> 05:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:26.230 --> 05:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
tony fallon
 
05:33:27.910 --> 05:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of people have said
 
05:33:30.948 --> 05:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
that i'm not a doctor i'm not a
 
05:33:33.030 --> 05:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
business owner i am a business owner
 
05:33:33.040 --> 05:33:33.910 align:start position:0%
business owner i am a business owner
um

05:33:33.910 --> 05:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:35.590 --> 05:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
but also the companies and governments
 
05:33:37.510 --> 05:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
aren't doctors you know again you know
 
05:33:39.190 --> 05:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
from the earlier story
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time getting
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
individualized health care for my wife
 
05:33:45.190 --> 05:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
and there's lots of options for staying
 
05:33:45.200 --> 05:33:46.070 align:start position:0%
and there's lots of options for staying
safe

05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
safe
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
the the problem with the current scene
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
that this is trying to address this bill
 
05:33:51.910 --> 05:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
that which we do support tries to
 
05:33:51.920 --> 05:33:53.190 align:start position:0%
that which we do support tries to
address

05:33:53.190 --> 05:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
is that is aaron kind of alluded to
 
05:33:59.350 --> 05:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
companies have a lot of power
 
05:34:01.350 --> 05:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you're if you're a
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
regular joe going out to get a job and
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
they say you must do this to stay your
 
05:34:06.480 --> 05:34:07.430 align:start position:0%
they say you must do this to stay your
job

05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:34:09.510 --> 05:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
that that's a substantial weight that's
 
05:34:12.310 --> 05:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
a substantial burden to try to
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know walk away from
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
and yes i i know that medicaid
 
05:34:18.868 --> 05:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
does require this and yes there's all
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of conflicts
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
but as a sole practitioner
 
05:34:23.280 --> 05:34:24.628 align:start position:0%
but as a sole practitioner
architect

05:34:24.628 --> 05:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
architect
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
i had to sign
 
05:34:29.190 --> 05:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
a religious exemption
 
05:34:31.190 --> 05:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
can you guess why
 
05:34:32.548 --> 05:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
it's because i'm on the board of a
 
05:34:35.750 --> 05:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
non-profit that seeks to help with
 
05:34:38.310 --> 05:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
addiction recovery and mental health uh
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
white horse recovery
 
05:34:42.390 --> 05:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
medicaid made white horse recovery
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
because we take medicaid funds
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
i as a board member had to sign every
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
religious exemption i was i was blown
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
away so
 
05:34:54.390 --> 05:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
yes of course there's plenty of
 
05:34:56.150 --> 05:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
conflicts but
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
this is a big big deal when an employer
 
05:35:02.948 --> 05:35:02.958 align:start position:0%
or a government body goes to play a
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
doctor which they are not there's lots
 
05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
of other ways to say stay safe
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
we really don't think this vaccine is
 
05:35:12.230 --> 05:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
safe at all there's plenty of
 
05:35:13.830 --> 05:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
dangers with us
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:35:16.548 --> 05:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for all your service
 
05:35:16.558 --> 05:35:17.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for all your service
too

05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
and next time you come back you get 46
 
05:35:21.830 --> 05:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
extra seconds
 
05:35:21.840 --> 05:35:23.910 align:start position:0%
extra seconds
excellent

05:35:23.910 --> 05:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
05:35:27.750 --> 05:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
and you know we've had dogs in this
 
05:35:32.070 --> 05:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
committee room before and the chair is
 
05:35:37.510 --> 05:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to dogs coming in here
 
05:35:41.510 --> 05:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:41.520 --> 05:35:42.788 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:35:42.788 --> 05:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:48.948 --> 05:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
05:35:50.390 --> 05:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know you've been here long enough i
 
05:35:52.708 --> 05:35:52.718 align:start position:0%

05:36:05.670 --> 05:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
and your last name's not bedford and you
 
05:36:10.470 --> 05:36:10.480 align:start position:0%

chester from bedford and i'm gonna be
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
extremely brief i'm just actually wanted
 
05:36:17.590 --> 05:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
to come up here because there were a
 
05:36:19.670 --> 05:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
couple of people that wanted to speak
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
but could not stay so i'm passing around
 
05:36:25.430 --> 05:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
what the the article that or the piece
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
of paper that they had they only had one
 
05:36:29.590 --> 05:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
copy with them um so i passed that
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
around for all you folks so that you'll
 
05:36:33.430 --> 05:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
have it they also gave me another
 
05:36:33.440 --> 05:36:34.628 align:start position:0%
have it they also gave me another
document

05:36:34.628 --> 05:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
document
 
05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know for sure if that was
 
05:36:38.230 --> 05:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
something that they wanted to share with
 
05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay if it is i will i will i will send
 
05:36:47.670 --> 05:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
that to you this evening and and talk to
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
you about it um the bottom line is for
 
05:36:52.948 --> 05:36:52.958 align:start position:0%
me is is that if private businesses want
 
05:36:55.990 --> 05:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
to mandate things the reality is is that
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
in our gover in our society we allow
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
private businesses to do that however
 
05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
what i strongly believe is that if
 
05:37:07.270 --> 05:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
you're taking any kind of public funds
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
state or from my taxes if i don't want
 
05:37:13.030 --> 05:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
it as a person of new hampshire i
 
05:37:14.708 --> 05:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be supporting it
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
05:37:19.350 --> 05:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
let me ask you a question absolutely
 
05:37:22.230 --> 05:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
does it seem like
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government takes more and
 
05:37:27.270 --> 05:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
more of our taxes and then sends them
 
05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
back to our state so we can do stuff
 
05:37:31.590 --> 05:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
with our money
 
05:37:34.470 --> 05:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
only because it comes back from the feds
 
05:37:37.110 --> 05:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
it has all these strengths attached
 
05:37:39.750 --> 05:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
and that is extremely concerning i agree
 
05:37:41.030 --> 05:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
with you 100
 
05:37:43.190 --> 05:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the question
 
05:37:45.510 --> 05:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:48.868 --> 05:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
mr representative soloway
 
05:37:50.948 --> 05:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i can just
 
05:37:52.470 --> 05:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
point out to you
 
05:37:55.350 --> 05:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
that we have some of the lowest
 
05:37:58.788 --> 05:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
tax rate tax rates in the world
 
05:37:58.798 --> 05:37:59.830 align:start position:0%
tax rate tax rates in the world
and

05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
taxes were substantially higher under
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
the eisenhower administration let's go
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
back to that i'm that old and
 
05:38:11.990 --> 05:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
in addition it was under the reagan
 
05:38:14.390 --> 05:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
administration that we ended block
 
05:38:14.400 --> 05:38:15.510 align:start position:0%
administration that we ended block
grants

05:38:15.510 --> 05:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
grants
 
05:38:18.548 --> 05:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
to states and cities we don't get nearly
 
05:38:21.270 --> 05:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
the money back from the feds that we did
 
05:38:24.390 --> 05:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
before reagan canceled block grants
 
05:38:26.628 --> 05:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
those tax and spend republicans do it
 
05:38:28.470 --> 05:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
every time don't they
 
05:38:30.390 --> 05:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman when you get to be as old as
 
05:38:32.948 --> 05:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
me you'll remember these things
 
05:38:34.868 --> 05:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
when i get to be as old as you i will
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
have forgotten most things
 
05:38:40.150 --> 05:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
as as a as a
 
05:38:42.470 --> 05:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
as a former tax accountant
 
05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
we get in the state of new hampshire at
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
least when i was doing tax accounting we
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
get less than 30 percent back because of
 
05:38:50.470 --> 05:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
the taxes we pay to the federal
 
05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
government new hampshire gets less than
 
05:38:54.708 --> 05:38:54.718 align:start position:0%
30 percent back
 
05:38:56.230 --> 05:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's still the case it
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
was it was the case okay we're going off
 
05:39:00.628 --> 05:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
we're going off the bill but but yep
 
05:39:05.750 --> 05:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
from do it and i don't think it means do
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
it but it says do it on the bottom
 
05:39:12.788 --> 05:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
remind us what do it is
 
05:39:15.990 --> 05:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
department of information technology
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
wow correct
 
05:39:21.270 --> 05:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
bonjour yeah
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is dennis goulet
 
05:39:25.270 --> 05:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'm the commissioner for the department
 
05:39:27.590 --> 05:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
of information technology
 
05:39:29.030 --> 05:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
or doit
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
which is really responsible for the i.t
 
05:39:33.670 --> 05:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
for the executive branch
 
05:39:35.030 --> 05:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
but i think today a lot of what i'm
 
05:39:36.948 --> 05:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
going to speak about would be applicable
 
05:39:39.030 --> 05:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
for the other branches of government
 
05:39:41.990 --> 05:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
as well from a technology perspective
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
05:39:46.390 --> 05:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition because the
 
05:39:48.310 --> 05:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
in particular the the prescription
 
05:39:52.470 --> 05:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
against contracting
 
05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
companies with a certain
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
set of policies would put a significant
 
05:40:00.310 --> 05:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
operational and financial burden on the
 
05:40:03.190 --> 05:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
technology function for the state
 
05:40:04.708 --> 05:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
and for those other
 
05:40:07.270 --> 05:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
entities that are named that are
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
in scope for the bill as well but that
 
05:40:11.110 --> 05:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know that's not my scope but i
 
05:40:13.510 --> 05:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that that would be the case
 
05:40:15.990 --> 05:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
we just when we saw the bill we did a
 
05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
quick look at a handful of the larger
 
05:40:21.190 --> 05:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
companies that are servicing us today
 
05:40:22.390 --> 05:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible to do business
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire
 
05:40:29.110 --> 05:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
based on their current policies
 
05:40:29.120 --> 05:40:30.230 align:start position:0%
based on their current policies
so

05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:35.030 --> 05:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
implementation should we decide to
 
05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
implement this bill
 
05:40:38.310 --> 05:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
then we would have to replace all of
 
05:40:38.320 --> 05:40:39.510 align:start position:0%
then we would have to replace all of
those

05:40:39.510 --> 05:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:40:41.750 --> 05:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
contracts which i'm not you know each
 
05:40:43.190 --> 05:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
one of them's written in their own way
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
over time so
 
05:40:46.310 --> 05:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
haven't had any chance to go through
 
05:40:47.190 --> 05:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
them and
 
05:40:48.628 --> 05:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
find out whether we'd have to buy our
 
05:40:50.788 --> 05:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
way out of them or not or whether we'd
 
05:40:52.708 --> 05:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
put ourselves in breach by doing things
 
05:40:55.110 --> 05:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
which could be the case
 
05:40:56.788 --> 05:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
but what i would say is you know we
 
05:40:56.798 --> 05:40:58.070 align:start position:0%
but what i would say is you know we
spent

05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
spent
 
05:41:00.070 --> 05:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
many millions of dollars implementing
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
those systems in the first place
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
um one of them's the largest system one
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the largest systems in the state our
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility system which i'm
 
05:41:09.910 --> 05:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
sure you're well well aware of deloitte
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
is you know what would fall into that
 
05:41:12.080 --> 05:41:13.270 align:start position:0%
is you know what would fall into that
category

05:41:13.270 --> 05:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
category
 
05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
um sure we could replace them
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
at a
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
significant cost and
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
in some of the cases when i look at it
 
05:41:24.470 --> 05:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know things like running our email
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
and collaboration system which the
 
05:41:29.510 --> 05:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
gen court runs the same system from
 
05:41:29.520 --> 05:41:31.910 align:start position:0%
gen court runs the same system from
microsoft

05:41:31.910 --> 05:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
microsoft
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure there is a company that
 
05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
would supply that service that doesn't
 
05:41:35.280 --> 05:41:36.548 align:start position:0%
would supply that service that doesn't
have

05:41:36.548 --> 05:41:36.558 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:41:38.230 --> 05:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
internal corporate policies that would
 
05:41:40.470 --> 05:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
transgress the language of this bill so
 
05:41:42.628 --> 05:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
we might not even have an option to to
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
move forward operationally so surprised
 
05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
um you know there's there's the fiscal
 
05:41:47.600 --> 05:41:48.470 align:start position:0%
um you know there's there's the fiscal
notes

05:41:48.470 --> 05:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
notes
 
05:41:51.190 --> 05:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
is inadequate um and if you told me
 
05:41:52.868 --> 05:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
dennis go get me a fiscal note as
 
05:41:54.788 --> 05:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible quick quick wouldn't
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
be very quick on this because it's very
 
05:41:58.708 --> 05:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
far-reaching and and would require
 
05:42:00.628 --> 05:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
detailed analysis of contracts and
 
05:42:02.548 --> 05:42:02.558 align:start position:0%
functions and and actually company
 
05:42:04.868 --> 05:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
policies which by the way are changing
 
05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
all the time so we're seeing you know
 
05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeing you know in some in some
 
05:42:11.110 --> 05:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
cases where you know different companies
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
are changing their policies so
 
05:42:15.750 --> 05:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
we might look at a policy with somebody
 
05:42:17.430 --> 05:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
we're contracting with today and their
 
05:42:19.510 --> 05:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
their policies may change over time is
 
05:42:21.670 --> 05:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
as again we learn more about
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know what's the appropriate way to
 
05:42:25.910 --> 05:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
to operate as a company and in their own
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
best interests so
 
05:42:30.628 --> 05:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
i think that concludes my testimony uh
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that folks
 
05:42:32.400 --> 05:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that folks
have

05:42:34.470 --> 05:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:42:37.590 --> 05:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:44.470 --> 05:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair uh my name is

05:43:15.270 --> 05:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm joe kirsty the chief financial

glencliffe home
 
05:43:22.868 --> 05:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
i am going to speak to this bill from
 
05:43:24.470 --> 05:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
the operations perspective the
 
05:43:25.990 --> 05:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
we have a centralized bureau of
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
contracting currently as of this morning
 
05:43:33.990 --> 05:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
we had about 863 active contracts
 
05:43:36.150 --> 05:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
the department contracts both with
 
05:43:37.830 --> 05:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities but also
 
05:43:40.470 --> 05:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
consultants law firms
 
05:43:43.430 --> 05:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
marketing companies i.t companies and a
 
05:43:45.270 --> 05:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
variety of others it really runs the
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
gambit our department has as everyone
 
05:43:49.830 --> 05:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
here wells know well knows we have many
 
05:43:52.948 --> 05:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
divisions and many different operations
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
at this point in time it'd be difficult
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
to predict what the potential
 
05:44:00.310 --> 05:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
impact on operations would be
 
05:44:02.708 --> 05:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
specifically relative to the provision
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
prohibiting contractors
 
05:44:08.310 --> 05:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
from establishing vaccine mandates
 
05:44:10.070 --> 05:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
05:44:12.470 --> 05:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
move if if this were to move forward and
 
05:44:14.150 --> 05:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
it were to become law
 
05:44:15.510 --> 05:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
um we
 
05:44:17.670 --> 05:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
we would potentially have to terminate a
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
number of our contracts like again i
 
05:44:21.510 --> 05:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
can't determine uh how many that would
 
05:44:24.390 --> 05:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
be um we would likely have we could have
 
05:44:27.750 --> 05:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
the potential for a lapse in particular
 
05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
types of services we would likely need
 
05:44:32.470 --> 05:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
to go back out to bid oftentimes that
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
can result in increased costs
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
particularly given the current inflation
 
05:44:39.270 --> 05:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
that we are experiencing
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
so with with that being said again at
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
this point in time the the immediate
 
05:44:46.548 --> 05:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
impact uh would both be operational as
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
well as potentially financial in the
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
long run and uh echoing the the
 
05:44:51.910 --> 05:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
sentiments of the attorney general's
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
office um as noted in the
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note there could be some
 
05:44:58.548 --> 05:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
potential litigation issues arising from
 
05:45:05.350 --> 05:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
and just to add for new hampshire
 
05:45:07.600 --> 05:45:08.708 align:start position:0%
and just to add for new hampshire
hospital

05:45:08.708 --> 05:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
05:45:10.708 --> 05:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
so much my testimony
 
05:45:12.150 --> 05:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
would be similar to other testimony i've
 
05:45:13.590 --> 05:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
provided in recent weeks to this
 
05:45:13.600 --> 05:45:14.868 align:start position:0%
provided in recent weeks to this
committee

05:45:14.868 --> 05:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:45:16.868 --> 05:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
but i did just want to mention a few key
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
pieces relative to this specific bill so
 
05:45:20.628 --> 05:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
05:45:22.788 --> 05:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
exemption established in section 9 g
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
colon 3 for licensed medical facilities
 
05:45:27.430 --> 05:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
but that exemption does limit the
 
05:45:30.390 --> 05:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
application of a vaccine mandate to
 
05:45:33.750 --> 05:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
instances where a direct threat exists
 
05:45:36.708 --> 05:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit unsure as to
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
who or how that definition would be
 
05:45:39.990 --> 05:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
applied it likely wouldn't be applied
 
05:45:42.230 --> 05:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
consistently across facilities
 
05:45:43.830 --> 05:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
but that limitation to specific
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
instances where a direct threat exists
 
05:45:47.990 --> 05:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
likely would prevent us from
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
having a vaccine requirements as a
 
05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
condition of employment for things like
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
measles and mumps and rubella etc etc
 
05:46:00.390 --> 05:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
so we have similar infection prevention
 
05:46:03.030 --> 05:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
concerns on this bill as we have in
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
priors a prior testimony that i provided
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
again because of that
 
05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
application for the medical exemption to
 
05:46:13.830 --> 05:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
only instances where a direct threat is
 
05:46:13.840 --> 05:46:14.868 align:start position:0%
only instances where a direct threat is
present

05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
present
 
05:46:16.628 --> 05:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
we do believe that would be conflicting
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
with the cms coven 19 vaccine mandate
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
as well as the exemptions that
 
05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative canark previously
 
05:46:26.230 --> 05:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that are that would be new and
 
05:46:28.230 --> 05:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
they are not spelled out in the cms-cova
 
05:46:30.310 --> 05:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
19 vaccine mandate
 
05:46:32.470 --> 05:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
so again those would likely
 
05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
put us at risk for potential loss of
 
05:46:36.150 --> 05:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
accreditation and the potential loss of
 
05:46:36.160 --> 05:46:37.270 align:start position:0%
accreditation and the potential loss of
our

05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid funding as well as
 
05:46:40.470 --> 05:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
our dish funding
 
05:46:43.510 --> 05:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
and then i would say the one last
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
risk relative to this bill for new
 
05:46:47.830 --> 05:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and glencliff home
 
05:46:47.840 --> 05:46:49.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and glencliff home
the

05:46:49.350 --> 05:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:46:52.948 --> 05:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
section 9 g5 establishes a liberal
 
05:46:55.590 --> 05:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
application of house bill 1495 and
 
05:46:57.830 --> 05:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
articulates that any application of the
 
05:47:00.070 --> 05:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill which is held invalid is limited
 
05:47:02.548 --> 05:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
only to the section in which
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
which is invalid
 
05:47:05.750 --> 05:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so the department's unsure if the
 
05:47:07.830 --> 05:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
medical facility exemption would extend
 
05:47:10.230 --> 05:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
to contractors of new hampshire hospital
 
05:47:12.230 --> 05:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
such as dartmouth-hitchcock
 
05:47:13.910 --> 05:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
and so that would be a concern for us
 
05:47:15.910 --> 05:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
dartmouth does provide all of our
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
psychiatric and medical services at both
 
05:47:18.718 --> 05:47:20.708 align:start position:0%
psychiatric and medical services at both
facilities

05:47:20.708 --> 05:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:47:20.718 --> 05:47:22.868 align:start position:0%
facilities
and

05:47:22.868 --> 05:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:47:24.868 --> 05:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
without their services
 
05:47:26.470 --> 05:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i would also say if that was to be
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
reprocured in some capacity any vendor
 
05:47:30.868 --> 05:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
qualified to provide those services is
 
05:47:33.270 --> 05:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
likely implementing the vaccine mandate
 
05:47:36.150 --> 05:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
or the kova 19 vaccine mandate
 
05:47:38.470 --> 05:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
so that would that would
 
05:47:40.070 --> 05:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
almost cease operations for new
 
05:47:42.070 --> 05:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and glencliff and i'm
 
05:47:44.070 --> 05:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
05:47:49.430 --> 05:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
this ends the hearing on house bill
 
05:47:58.400 --> 05:48:00.070 align:start position:0%
this ends the hearing on house bill
1495.

05:48:00.070 --> 05:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
1495.
 
05:48:01.590 --> 05:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
we do have some other work that we're
 
05:48:03.590 --> 05:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to be attending to
 
05:48:06.310 --> 05:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
and if anybody here
 
05:48:08.310 --> 05:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
thinks that this bill
 
05:48:11.510 --> 05:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
could have a better chance if amended
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
then i would suggest
 
05:48:15.990 --> 05:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
you folks get a hold of representative
 
05:48:18.628 --> 05:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
lanzara the chief sponsor
 
05:48:21.430 --> 05:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
or representative harvey bolia who spoke
 
05:48:22.628 --> 05:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
before us
 
05:48:25.430 --> 05:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
and connect with them
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
and see what you may come up with
 
05:48:28.878 --> 05:48:30.150 align:start position:0%
and see what you may come up with
now

05:48:30.150 --> 05:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:48:31.510 --> 05:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
that ends
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
the schedule for today and we're going
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
to exec a few bills
 
05:48:38.948 --> 05:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
and before we do um
 
05:48:40.548 --> 05:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
i just want to let you know something
 
05:48:42.868 --> 05:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
that they do in congress and while
 
05:48:46.070 --> 05:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's not usually a model for me
 
05:48:46.080 --> 05:48:47.590 align:start position:0%
that's not usually a model for me
uh

05:48:47.590 --> 05:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:48:50.070 --> 05:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
there is one thing that they do
 
05:48:52.390 --> 05:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
and that is if a representative has to
 
05:48:55.030 --> 05:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
be away for illness
 
05:48:58.070 --> 05:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
that representative is paired
 
05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
with a representative from the party
 
05:49:00.080 --> 05:49:01.350 align:start position:0%
with a representative from the party
opposite

05:49:01.350 --> 05:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
opposite
 
05:49:03.510 --> 05:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
so they wash
 
05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
and that's fair
 
05:49:05.120 --> 05:49:06.470 align:start position:0%
and that's fair
and

05:49:06.470 --> 05:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:09.750 --> 05:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
one of the republicans has left for the
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
day and one of the democrats has left
 
05:49:14.788 --> 05:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
for today so if bills break
 
05:49:16.548 --> 05:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
in a partisan way which i think these
 
05:49:17.750 --> 05:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
05:49:19.750 --> 05:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
it won't come out 11 ten it'll come out
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
ten nine
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't have to do that but i want
 
05:49:23.760 --> 05:49:26.150 align:start position:0%
and i don't have to do that but i want
to

05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
05:49:28.558 --> 05:49:30.070 align:start position:0%
the fact that
the

05:49:30.070 --> 05:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:49:32.628 --> 05:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
vote differential
 
05:49:34.788 --> 05:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
is balanced off
 
05:49:37.110 --> 05:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
with that in mind uh please take out
 
05:49:40.868 --> 05:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
permitting miners
 
05:49:44.548 --> 05:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
over the age of 16 to obtain a
 
05:49:48.470 --> 05:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination without parental consent and
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative king
 
05:49:54.470 --> 05:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:57.510 --> 05:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd like to make a
 
05:50:00.310 --> 05:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
motion that this bill
 
05:50:02.470 --> 05:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
be itl
 
05:50:05.190 --> 05:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative king moves itl
 
05:50:07.590 --> 05:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative kelsey i second that
 
05:50:08.948 --> 05:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
second that
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
now we can discuss it doesn't have to be
 
05:50:17.670 --> 05:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:20.070 --> 05:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'll start things off with um i don't
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
have i'm still getting organized here
 
05:50:25.910 --> 05:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:25.920 --> 05:50:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
my

05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:50:30.470 --> 05:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
my interpretation of this this bill is
 
05:50:30.480 --> 05:50:31.830 align:start position:0%
my interpretation of this this bill is
um

05:50:31.830 --> 05:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:31.840 --> 05:50:33.270 align:start position:0%
um
that

05:50:33.270 --> 05:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:50:35.910 --> 05:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
it takes away the parental rights
 
05:50:37.510 --> 05:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
of um
 
05:50:39.830 --> 05:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
of basically what is
 
05:50:41.590 --> 05:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
considered a minor
 
05:50:43.510 --> 05:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
at 16 years old
 
05:50:45.990 --> 05:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
and there are many states that have a
 
05:50:48.150 --> 05:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
precedent where
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
18 is that age so
 
05:50:53.910 --> 05:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'll start things there
 
05:50:56.548 --> 05:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
and picking up on that i have a handout
 
05:50:56.558 --> 05:50:58.628 align:start position:0%
and picking up on that i have a handout
um

05:50:58.628 --> 05:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
one of these official government things
 
05:51:03.750 --> 05:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:51:06.548 --> 05:51:06.558 align:start position:0%
first column says age at which a person
 
05:51:10.628 --> 05:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
may generally consent to health care
 
05:51:12.548 --> 05:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
progressive states like new york
 
05:51:15.190 --> 05:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
illinois and california the age on this
 
05:51:18.390 --> 05:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
printout is 18.
 
05:51:20.470 --> 05:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
alabama which i believe is not a
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
progressive state
 
05:51:24.628 --> 05:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
it's 14.
 
05:51:24.638 --> 05:51:26.150 align:start position:0%
it's 14.
and

05:51:26.150 --> 05:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
south carolina ditto
 
05:51:28.878 --> 05:51:30.788 align:start position:0%
south carolina ditto
16

05:51:30.788 --> 05:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
16
 
05:51:33.190 --> 05:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
and any thoughts i may have would be
 
05:51:35.670 --> 05:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
impolite about that
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i'm saying to
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
build on what representative king you
 
05:51:41.830 --> 05:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
just said
 
05:51:43.510 --> 05:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:51:43.520 --> 05:51:45.030 align:start position:0%
is that
18

05:51:45.030 --> 05:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
18
 
05:51:46.548 --> 05:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
seems pretty much
 
05:51:48.390 --> 05:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
generally speaking now we know about an
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
emancipated child or somebody who's
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
pulled out of a home because it's a
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
horror show but generally speaking the
 
05:51:57.350 --> 05:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
age is 18 no matter what color your
 
05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:04.390 --> 05:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative king i'll add one more
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
thing now that i have my notes in front
 
05:52:08.470 --> 05:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
of me the the second part of
 
05:52:11.510 --> 05:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
of uh not just the age but
 
05:52:14.948 --> 05:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
uh it's indirectly related to the age
 
05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
is can a 16 year old really understand
 
05:52:20.628 --> 05:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
adverse effects and what what the
 
05:52:23.910 --> 05:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
repercussions are and um
 
05:52:25.510 --> 05:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's my feeling that
 
05:52:26.470 --> 05:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're old enough to
 
05:52:29.910 --> 05:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
understand that and to be quite honest
 
05:52:31.110 --> 05:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
with you
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
there are times in my
 
05:52:35.590 --> 05:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
my lifetime i've had to make decisions
 
05:52:37.350 --> 05:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
for my kids and i didn't fully
 
05:52:39.670 --> 05:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
understand it so i know a 16 year old
 
05:52:42.548 --> 05:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
would have a real hard time with that
 
05:52:44.868 --> 05:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to participate in the
 
05:52:44.878 --> 05:52:51.830 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to participate in the
discussion

05:52:51.830 --> 05:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:55.350 --> 05:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:55.360 --> 05:52:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:52:57.030 --> 05:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
i felt very grown up at 16 i mean some
 
05:53:02.470 --> 05:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
of us are and some of us aren't
 
05:53:02.480 --> 05:53:03.830 align:start position:0%
of us are and some of us aren't
and

05:53:03.830 --> 05:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:53:06.150 --> 05:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
05:53:07.510 --> 05:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
some of my
 
05:53:10.230 --> 05:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
children who i also felt were mature for
 
05:53:12.868 --> 05:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
certain ages made
 
05:53:15.990 --> 05:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
birth control decisions and whatever
 
05:53:20.548 --> 05:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
between 16 and 18. and so this bill to
 
05:53:23.830 --> 05:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
the best of my understanding is
 
05:53:26.708 --> 05:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
focused on allowing a child to get a
 
05:53:26.718 --> 05:53:28.070 align:start position:0%
focused on allowing a child to get a
vaccine

05:53:28.070 --> 05:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:53:31.270 --> 05:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
and um i know we like the stories i have
 
05:53:33.430 --> 05:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
a neighbor across the street
 
05:53:35.270 --> 05:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
her dog was barking too much and i went
 
05:53:36.868 --> 05:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
over to chat you know we're over the
 
05:53:38.708 --> 05:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
fence neighbors
 
05:53:40.868 --> 05:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
so i said oh you've vaccinated she goes
 
05:53:42.230 --> 05:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
no i don't believe in that i'm like oh
 
05:53:44.548 --> 05:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
okay you know whatever her 18 year old
 
05:53:44.558 --> 05:53:45.430 align:start position:0%
okay you know whatever her 18 year old
daughter

05:53:45.430 --> 05:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
05:53:48.390 --> 05:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to get vaccinated because
 
05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
the girl's
 
05:53:52.230 --> 05:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
father this woman's ex-husband had had
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
several heart attacks and they didn't
 
05:53:56.230 --> 05:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
she and her brother didn't want to bring
 
05:53:58.310 --> 05:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
covet to their dad
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
and my neighbor didn't allow it and gosh
 
05:54:04.230 --> 05:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
everybody over thanksgiving had coveted
 
05:54:06.708 --> 05:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
so i no one died
 
05:54:08.628 --> 05:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
but i'm just saying here was a
 
05:54:10.708 --> 05:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
responsible teenager she was
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
18 soon to be 18 because if she was 18
 
05:54:15.670 --> 05:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
she could have done it and her mother
 
05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
prevented her from getting vaccinated so
 
05:54:21.110 --> 05:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
and i i just thought that was a shame i
 
05:54:21.120 --> 05:54:21.910 align:start position:0%
and i i just thought that was a shame i
hope

05:54:21.910 --> 05:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
hope
 
05:54:23.430 --> 05:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
that the children
 
05:54:26.070 --> 05:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
and their dad do not have long lasting
 
05:54:28.628 --> 05:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
effects from having
 
05:54:31.990 --> 05:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
had covered but it didn't have to be and
 
05:54:36.788 --> 05:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
05:54:42.708 --> 05:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman if i read this
 
05:54:44.948 --> 05:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
bill correctly
 
05:54:46.230 --> 05:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
it says
 
05:54:50.070 --> 05:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
permitting minors over the age of 16
 
05:54:53.910 --> 05:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
which i believe means 17. look at line
 
05:54:53.920 --> 05:54:56.070 align:start position:0%
which i believe means 17. look at line
three

05:54:56.070 --> 05:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:54:59.430 --> 05:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
at nine line three
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
05:55:03.670 --> 05:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
a minor 16 years of israel then it is
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:09.600 --> 05:55:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:55:12.230 --> 05:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:13.350 --> 05:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
05:55:13.360 --> 05:55:14.548 align:start position:0%
that's a
difference

05:55:14.548 --> 05:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:55:14.558 --> 05:55:15.510 align:start position:0%
difference
then

05:55:15.510 --> 05:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:55:18.548 --> 05:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
of at least one year and if our current
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
law is 18
 
05:55:23.830 --> 05:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
and the difference from 16 to 18 is two
 
05:55:26.470 --> 05:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
from 17 to 18 is one right
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
um i think perhaps either the title of
 
05:55:31.990 --> 05:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
the bill needs to be changed or there
 
05:55:33.270 --> 05:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be the minute we need a little
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:41.830 --> 05:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:43.910 --> 05:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
05:55:45.590 --> 05:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair
 
05:55:45.600 --> 05:55:46.470 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair
um

05:55:46.470 --> 05:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:49.510 --> 05:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'll be honest i'm i'm conflicted uh
 
05:55:52.628 --> 05:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
being the father of three very lovely
 
05:55:52.638 --> 05:55:53.910 align:start position:0%
being the father of three very lovely
daughters

05:55:53.910 --> 05:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
daughters
 
05:55:55.750 --> 05:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
not prejudiced of course
 
05:55:57.270 --> 05:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
we've done background checks and they
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
say the same about you sir
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
i pay i paid them well
 
05:56:02.878 --> 05:56:03.670 align:start position:0%
i pay i paid them well
um

05:56:03.670 --> 05:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:06.470 --> 05:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
i can i certainly appreciate that i
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
would certainly like to know if they
 
05:56:10.310 --> 05:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
were going to get a vaccination however
 
05:56:12.948 --> 05:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
i also from personal experience when i
 
05:56:14.708 --> 05:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
was growing up and
 
05:56:17.110 --> 05:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
also from stories that my daughters
 
05:56:19.190 --> 05:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
related and kids that they went to
 
05:56:23.350 --> 05:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
school with when they were growing up
 
05:56:25.110 --> 05:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
some of the kids in this age group
 
05:56:27.190 --> 05:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have
 
05:56:28.948 --> 05:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
05:56:31.190 --> 05:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i think to me this is a might be
 
05:56:31.200 --> 05:56:32.470 align:start position:0%
and i think to me this is a might be
addressing

05:56:32.470 --> 05:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
those in that age group
 
05:56:37.750 --> 05:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
that would we would consider
 
05:56:40.150 --> 05:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
that don't have the advantage
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
of parents
 
05:56:43.190 --> 05:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
to help them
 
05:56:45.590 --> 05:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
and to me that's
 
05:56:48.628 --> 05:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
not not the kids that have parents and
 
05:56:50.788 --> 05:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
have guidance
 
05:56:52.230 --> 05:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to have that counseling
 
05:56:53.910 --> 05:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
anyway but the ones
 
05:56:56.948 --> 05:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
to me the ones that really need it
 
05:56:58.948 --> 05:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
don't have the counseling i won't go
 
05:57:00.628 --> 05:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
into detail but i could give you a
 
05:57:02.948 --> 05:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
number of examples some very tragic
 
05:57:02.958 --> 05:57:05.990 align:start position:0%
number of examples some very tragic
unfortunately

05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:08.390 --> 05:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i think of them
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
and my heart goes out
 
05:57:13.750 --> 05:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little bit conflicted here and
 
05:57:17.350 --> 05:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
i must confess i'm leaning to to
 
05:57:20.390 --> 05:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
throw my hat for these kids
 
05:57:23.670 --> 05:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
who are trying to grow up despite the
 
05:57:23.680 --> 05:57:24.708 align:start position:0%
who are trying to grow up despite the
lack

05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
lack
 
05:57:26.548 --> 05:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
of any support
 
05:57:27.430 --> 05:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:57:30.390 --> 05:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
as i read line six it is not just the
 
05:57:30.400 --> 05:57:31.670 align:start position:0%
as i read line six it is not just the
parent

05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
parent
 
05:57:34.788 --> 05:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
it could be the legal guardian as well
 
05:57:34.798 --> 05:57:36.150 align:start position:0%
it could be the legal guardian as well
and

05:57:36.150 --> 05:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:38.548 --> 05:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure how many 16 year olds
 
05:57:42.070 --> 05:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
are fully emancipated out from under any
 
05:57:44.948 --> 05:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
parental or guardianship
 
05:57:47.830 --> 05:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up well that's that's in the
 
05:57:51.190 --> 05:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
letter of the law but from a functional
 
05:57:51.200 --> 05:57:52.390 align:start position:0%
letter of the law but from a functional
perspective

05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
05:57:54.548 --> 05:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
and again some of the things i'm
 
05:57:54.558 --> 05:57:55.750 align:start position:0%
and again some of the things i'm
recalling

05:57:55.750 --> 05:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
recalling
 
05:57:58.948 --> 05:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh which made the public eye uh when
 
05:58:01.190 --> 05:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
they occurred back in the day
 
05:58:01.200 --> 05:58:02.310 align:start position:0%
they occurred back in the day
um

05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:05.350 --> 05:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
didn't the parents were there
 
05:58:08.230 --> 05:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
in the letter of the law but were
 
05:58:11.110 --> 05:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
totally absent in the functional
 
05:58:11.120 --> 05:58:12.948 align:start position:0%
totally absent in the functional
concept

05:58:12.948 --> 05:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
concept
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:19.990 --> 05:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm really kind of torn
 
05:58:20.000 --> 05:58:21.430 align:start position:0%
i'm really kind of torn
um

05:58:21.430 --> 05:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
when i listen to the testimony
 
05:58:25.270 --> 05:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
and represent the king you brought this
 
05:58:28.230 --> 05:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
up before and it's a very valid point
 
05:58:30.548 --> 05:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
when you have a fully functional family
 
05:58:32.628 --> 05:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
this law is not needed
 
05:58:35.110 --> 05:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
however i do know
 
05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
having a spouse has worked in the school
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
system for many years as a school nurse
 
05:58:41.350 --> 05:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
to represent wood's point of view there
 
05:58:43.190 --> 05:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
are many parents that are absentee
 
05:58:43.200 --> 05:58:44.470 align:start position:0%
are many parents that are absentee
parents

05:58:44.470 --> 05:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:58:46.310 --> 05:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
that quite frankly
 
05:58:47.910 --> 05:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
abandon the children
 
05:58:49.030 --> 05:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
but they still have the legal
 
05:58:51.030 --> 05:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility in the child's control by
 
05:58:52.390 --> 05:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
that parent
 
05:58:55.750 --> 05:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm torn because if you're functional
 
05:58:58.070 --> 05:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need a law
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
however if you're not functional and the
 
05:59:01.830 --> 05:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
child is really out there on their own i
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
mean literally on their own i can tell
 
05:59:05.270 --> 05:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
you all kinds of horror stories that
 
05:59:06.390 --> 05:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
turn my
 
05:59:07.990 --> 05:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
hairs in the back of my neck from the
 
05:59:09.990 --> 05:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
story she brought home what do we do
 
05:59:11.830 --> 05:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
with those child those children how do
 
05:59:13.270 --> 05:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
we help them
 
05:59:14.788 --> 05:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
help themselves because they're not
 
05:59:16.548 --> 05:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
getting the parental support they need
 
05:59:19.030 --> 05:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's where i'm torn
 
05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
i took
 
05:59:23.110 --> 05:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
my experience of 47 years as a member of
 
05:59:26.230 --> 05:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
the clergy and added to it my wife's
 
05:59:28.548 --> 05:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
experience of 30-some years as a family
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
practice physician
 
05:59:32.868 --> 05:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
and would say that there
 
05:59:35.670 --> 05:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
are certainly those two
 
05:59:35.680 --> 05:59:36.708 align:start position:0%
are certainly those two
polls

05:59:36.708 --> 05:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
polls
 
05:59:40.628 --> 05:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
the you know i tell people i'm an aco
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
um oh which is not an adult child of an
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
alcoholic it's an adult child of ozzie
 
05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
and harriet
 
05:59:48.868 --> 05:59:48.878 align:start position:0%
and i am one
 
05:59:50.948 --> 05:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
and i know a lot of people who are i
 
05:59:53.110 --> 05:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
also know the horror stories believe me
 
05:59:55.670 --> 05:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
very closely the horror story sometimes
 
05:59:57.910 --> 05:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
when i had to go in to a house with
 
05:59:57.920 --> 05:59:59.510 align:start position:0%
when i had to go in to a house with
police

05:59:59.510 --> 05:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
police
 
06:00:01.030 --> 06:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
they put me in front
 
06:00:02.628 --> 06:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
and then they came in behind me i know
 
06:00:04.548 --> 06:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
those stories but there's a lot of
 
06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
families that are in the middle
 
06:00:08.470 --> 06:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
where they're sort of there
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
and they're not horrible parents but
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
they're not great parents either
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
and for those parents to find out their
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
child went off and did whatever it is
 
06:00:18.718 --> 06:00:20.070 align:start position:0%
child went off and did whatever it is
now

06:00:20.070 --> 06:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:00:21.910 --> 06:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
may cause the
 
06:00:26.150 --> 06:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
tenuous family dynamic to get worse
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
especially if god forbid the kid gets a
 
06:00:32.070 --> 06:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine and there's a bad outcome and
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden the kid's real sick and
 
06:00:36.310 --> 06:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
along the way the parents who have legal
 
06:00:38.628 --> 06:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
and financial responsibility discover oh
 
06:00:40.868 --> 06:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
the kid went off and got vaccinated on
 
06:00:40.878 --> 06:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
the kid went off and got vaccinated on
something

06:00:41.990 --> 06:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:00:44.470 --> 06:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
what was a minor stink show will now
 
06:00:47.350 --> 06:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
escalate and i wouldn't want the kids to
 
06:00:49.590 --> 06:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity when what they
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
need to do is try to strive yeah with a
 
06:00:54.070 --> 06:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
lot of yelling and door slamming but
 
06:00:56.150 --> 06:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
strive for a better family system even
 
06:00:57.910 --> 06:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
if it isn't the great one that i grew up
 
06:00:57.920 --> 06:00:58.868 align:start position:0%
if it isn't the great one that i grew up
with

06:00:58.868 --> 06:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:01:01.750 --> 06:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
so i think there is that big middle
 
06:01:04.628 --> 06:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
group of family units representative
 
06:01:04.638 --> 06:01:05.670 align:start position:0%
group of family units representative
leon

06:01:05.670 --> 06:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
leon
 
06:01:07.430 --> 06:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and you bring up a
 
06:01:09.430 --> 06:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
great point while
 
06:01:11.510 --> 06:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
we may disagree about how frequent
 
06:01:14.230 --> 06:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury happens we there are
 
06:01:14.240 --> 06:01:15.510 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury happens we there are
people

06:01:15.510 --> 06:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:01:16.868 --> 06:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
they do happen the question is a
 
06:01:19.030 --> 06:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
frequency and because there's no
 
06:01:21.430 --> 06:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
liability the families are left paying
 
06:01:23.830 --> 06:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
for the consequences of of those
 
06:01:23.840 --> 06:01:24.948 align:start position:0%
for the consequences of of those
injuries

06:01:24.948 --> 06:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
06:01:27.670 --> 06:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
and it's one thing if the family decides
 
06:01:30.310 --> 06:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
to do this and and says yes this is what
 
06:01:31.750 --> 06:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
we believe is the right choice for our
 
06:01:31.760 --> 06:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
we believe is the right choice for our
family

06:01:33.030 --> 06:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
family
 
06:01:34.868 --> 06:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
but if a child
 
06:01:37.990 --> 06:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
a 16 or 17 year old makes that decision
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
does that
 
06:01:41.270 --> 06:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then they end up with myocarditis
 
06:01:43.270 --> 06:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
and they end up having an expensive
 
06:01:46.150 --> 06:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
hospital stay that is either on the
 
06:01:48.390 --> 06:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
parent's insurance or they might be one
 
06:01:49.670 --> 06:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
of these marginal families that's
 
06:01:51.750 --> 06:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
getting by without insurance
 
06:01:53.910 --> 06:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
we might be looking at a situation where
 
06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
not only is that fracture of trust
 
06:01:56.400 --> 06:01:57.910 align:start position:0%
not only is that fracture of trust
because

06:01:57.910 --> 06:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:01:59.670 --> 06:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
where the child has gone out and
 
06:02:01.990 --> 06:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
received this vaccination but now it's
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
also possibly threatening the loss of
 
06:02:05.830 --> 06:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
their home we might be getting into
 
06:02:07.750 --> 06:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
really really murky waters in some of
 
06:02:10.548 --> 06:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
those marginal families where one thing
 
06:02:12.708 --> 06:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
like this could tip them far over the
 
06:02:12.718 --> 06:02:13.670 align:start position:0%
like this could tip them far over the
edge

06:02:13.670 --> 06:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
edge
 
06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
and i we're kind of trying to nibble
 
06:02:17.670 --> 06:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
around the problem of some parents not
 
06:02:19.750 --> 06:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
being good parents but we're going to
 
06:02:22.310 --> 06:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
throw a lot of people into that same
 
06:02:25.030 --> 06:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
same stockpot and there's a lot of
 
06:02:26.310 --> 06:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
families that we can actually make
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
things get worse
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that if we can just move
 
06:02:31.110 --> 06:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
past this a little bit more and stop
 
06:02:32.708 --> 06:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
trying to force i think there's a lot of
 
06:02:34.310 --> 06:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
people that'll back off and realize
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
actually i do want this
 
06:02:38.470 --> 06:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
and the less
 
06:02:40.470 --> 06:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
and this is just one more march forward
 
06:02:43.030 --> 06:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's increasing the distrust that
 
06:02:44.708 --> 06:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
people are having and we need to rebuild
 
06:02:47.110 --> 06:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
that trust we need to make sure that
 
06:02:48.788 --> 06:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
that children are discussing their
 
06:02:50.470 --> 06:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
choices with their parents and we're not
 
06:02:52.628 --> 06:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
going to throw them under the financial
 
06:02:54.150 --> 06:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
bus if they end up with one of these
 
06:02:58.150 --> 06:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro yes thank you mr
 
06:03:00.718 --> 06:03:01.910 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro yes thank you mr
chairman

06:03:01.910 --> 06:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:03:01.920 --> 06:03:03.110 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

06:03:03.110 --> 06:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:04.868 --> 06:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
i'll try to keep this brief because i
 
06:03:07.910 --> 06:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
think this is one of the issues that
 
06:03:10.150 --> 06:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're not going to convince each other
 
06:03:10.160 --> 06:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
we're not going to convince each other
of

06:03:11.270 --> 06:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:03:13.110 --> 06:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
not going to change each other's minds
 
06:03:14.788 --> 06:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:03:16.868 --> 06:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
and i'm of mixed minds you know
 
06:03:18.708 --> 06:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
practicing as a family therapist for
 
06:03:22.150 --> 06:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know i always wanted to bring
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
families together to like deal with
 
06:03:30.390 --> 06:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:32.310 --> 06:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
good parents bad parents if there is
 
06:03:33.510 --> 06:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
such a thing
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
those are people's parents and those are
 
06:03:37.990 --> 06:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
going to be the people in people's lives
 
06:03:40.150 --> 06:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
and so the more we can bring people
 
06:03:42.310 --> 06:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
together to decide on things together to
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
discuss things the better
 
06:03:47.110 --> 06:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
06:03:49.750 --> 06:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
i think we would all acknowledge that
 
06:03:54.390 --> 06:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 is a pretty random um
 
06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
choice to say that you're an adult when
 
06:03:59.110 --> 06:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
you're 18 years old and you're not an
 
06:04:01.110 --> 06:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
adult the day before
 
06:04:02.788 --> 06:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
it's uh that's some
 
06:04:06.628 --> 06:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
that's not god-given that's um
 
06:04:08.310 --> 06:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's a that's a
 
06:04:10.948 --> 06:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
man-made um distinction a person-made
 
06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
distinction excuse me um that is uh i
 
06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
was not offended and and we do need
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
something we you know we need something
 
06:04:20.708 --> 06:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
to go by
 
06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
um that that being said
 
06:04:25.270 --> 06:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
um going back to
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
chairman pearson's
 
06:04:32.390 --> 06:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:35.030 --> 06:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
how many states um where the age of
 
06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
consent for medical treatment is um 18
 
06:04:41.350 --> 06:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
i would say that we did have a piece of
 
06:04:41.360 --> 06:04:44.310 align:start position:0%
i would say that we did have a piece of
um

06:04:44.310 --> 06:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know we did have a summary on a
 
06:04:47.750 --> 06:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
different bill about mental health
 
06:04:50.390 --> 06:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
treatment and if you look at that you'll
 
06:04:52.628 --> 06:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
see that many many states
 
06:04:54.390 --> 06:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
allow for consent to mental health
 
06:04:57.910 --> 06:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
treatment at 12 and 14 at 16.
 
06:04:59.590 --> 06:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like the majority of
 
06:05:01.590 --> 06:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
states you can access mental health
 
06:05:04.788 --> 06:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
treatment um before you're 18
 
06:05:08.310 --> 06:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
without parental consent and i guess
 
06:05:09.590 --> 06:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:05:14.548 --> 06:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:16.948 --> 06:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
if your family is functioning reasonably
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
well and some of that is the luck of the
 
06:05:20.470 --> 06:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
draw it's not only if you're good
 
06:05:22.708 --> 06:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
parents i know great parents whose kids
 
06:05:25.510 --> 06:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
have had a lot of problems
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
but if you're if your family's
 
06:05:28.788 --> 06:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
functioning well
 
06:05:30.548 --> 06:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
you don't really need to deal with this
 
06:05:32.948 --> 06:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
at all because you'll just like discuss
 
06:05:35.590 --> 06:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
it together and i guess my my last point
 
06:05:38.070 --> 06:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
would just be that you know
 
06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
since everyone's talking about how great
 
06:05:41.670 --> 06:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
their kids are i would just say that i
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
have two daughters who are now way
 
06:05:45.110 --> 06:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
beyond 16
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
who i would have absolutely trusted to
 
06:05:49.830 --> 06:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
make this decision when they were 16
 
06:05:51.990 --> 06:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
without any um
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
without thinking twice um
 
06:05:58.070 --> 06:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna vote for this but i
 
06:06:00.868 --> 06:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
understand that some that frequently um
 
06:06:03.670 --> 06:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
when we're making decisions were
 
06:06:06.310 --> 06:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's um dueling
 
06:06:09.190 --> 06:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
positives and negatives and um
 
06:06:12.070 --> 06:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i happen to value both
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
family cohesiveness and parental
 
06:06:17.670 --> 06:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
not parental rights but parental
 
06:06:20.150 --> 06:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility for each other
 
06:06:23.830 --> 06:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
and um and the rights of children
 
06:06:25.510 --> 06:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:06:26.868 --> 06:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
i think we're just each going to take
 
06:06:28.708 --> 06:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
our best stab at this one and i'm going
 
06:06:31.350 --> 06:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
to vote for it
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to having three primary care
 
06:06:33.760 --> 06:06:35.030 align:start position:0%
in addition to having three primary care
providers

06:06:35.030 --> 06:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
providers
 
06:06:36.868 --> 06:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
the center i supervise has two
 
06:06:36.878 --> 06:06:38.470 align:start position:0%
the center i supervise has two
counselors

06:06:38.470 --> 06:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
06:06:40.868 --> 06:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
and i know my wife sometimes
 
06:06:42.948 --> 06:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
when talking to a
 
06:06:46.548 --> 06:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
between 16 and 18 year old
 
06:06:46.558 --> 06:06:47.670 align:start position:0%
between 16 and 18 year old
where

06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:06:51.190 --> 06:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
the child may not
 
06:06:54.070 --> 06:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
opt on his or her own without parental
 
06:06:54.080 --> 06:06:56.470 align:start position:0%
opt on his or her own without parental
consent

06:06:56.470 --> 06:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
consent
 
06:06:58.150 --> 06:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
discussions about
 
06:07:01.670 --> 06:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
what the family situation was
 
06:07:03.670 --> 06:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
and at that point
 
06:07:06.230 --> 06:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
my wife and i believe the other two will
 
06:07:08.470 --> 06:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
say we have two family systems
 
06:07:10.070 --> 06:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
counselors here
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like your family's
 
06:07:15.590 --> 06:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
not ideal but it's not horrid you don't
 
06:07:18.628 --> 06:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
have to be pulled out by dcyf but it
 
06:07:20.230 --> 06:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
sounds like you need to have a good sit
 
06:07:22.628 --> 06:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
down as a family and have family systems
 
06:07:25.830 --> 06:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
counseling and we have used what the
 
06:07:28.310 --> 06:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
initial question of the
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
primary care provider was
 
06:07:33.270 --> 06:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
as a teaching moment to see if we could
 
06:07:35.590 --> 06:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
not enter into that and
 
06:07:37.350 --> 06:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
i'm very grateful we have both of those
 
06:07:39.510 --> 06:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
places in the same building on the same
 
06:07:39.520 --> 06:07:40.708 align:start position:0%
places in the same building on the same
team

06:07:40.708 --> 06:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
team
 
06:07:43.990 --> 06:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
but yes i understand um and i hope that
 
06:07:47.270 --> 06:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm like you in that um well i have one
 
06:07:49.270 --> 06:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
great daughter but um
 
06:07:49.280 --> 06:07:50.150 align:start position:0%
great daughter but um
that

06:07:50.150 --> 06:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:07:54.070 --> 06:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:56.868 --> 06:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i definitely appreciate
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
everything that i've heard from
 
06:08:03.270 --> 06:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
the families that
 
06:08:05.830 --> 06:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
probably don't have the support system
 
06:08:08.230 --> 06:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
that they need to make this decision the
 
06:08:10.390 --> 06:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
problem with law is that it includes
 
06:08:10.400 --> 06:08:11.750 align:start position:0%
problem with law is that it includes
everybody

06:08:11.750 --> 06:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:08:13.990 --> 06:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so there's going gonna be a lot of
 
06:08:16.470 --> 06:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
families that would be ill affected by
 
06:08:17.910 --> 06:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
this and since we're talking about our
 
06:08:17.920 --> 06:08:18.788 align:start position:0%
this and since we're talking about our
kids

06:08:18.788 --> 06:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
kids
 
06:08:21.030 --> 06:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh i would trust my daughter with this
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
at 16
 
06:08:25.110 --> 06:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
but i have three boys there's no way i
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
would have said i would have recommended
 
06:08:26.798 --> 06:08:27.590 align:start position:0%
would have said i would have recommended
this

06:08:27.590 --> 06:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:08:27.600 --> 06:08:29.190 align:start position:0%
this
and

06:08:29.190 --> 06:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
to give you an example i had one
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
actually i had two boys that wanted
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
pierced ears at the age of like 14 or
 
06:08:38.390 --> 06:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
something like that and i said you can
 
06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
get your ears pierced when my mother got
 
06:08:43.190 --> 06:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
her ears pierced which was the age of
 
06:08:43.200 --> 06:08:44.708 align:start position:0%
her ears pierced which was the age of
56.

06:08:44.708 --> 06:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
56.
 
06:08:47.590 --> 06:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:50.310 --> 06:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
and they didn't see the humor in that um
 
06:08:52.470 --> 06:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
they did get pierced ears and then six
 
06:08:53.910 --> 06:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
months later they let them dry up
 
06:08:55.510 --> 06:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't as neat as they
 
06:08:56.868 --> 06:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
thought it was
 
06:08:59.270 --> 06:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then i had one who wanted tattoos in
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
the worst way and we said not until
 
06:09:03.030 --> 06:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
you're 18 and i thought that was going
 
06:09:05.910 --> 06:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
to be old enough for them to realize
 
06:09:05.920 --> 06:09:06.788 align:start position:0%
to be old enough for them to realize
and

06:09:06.788 --> 06:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
he started getting tattoos and kept
 
06:09:10.868 --> 06:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
getting tattoos until he was about 24
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then he got sick of tattoos so
 
06:09:13.200 --> 06:09:15.430 align:start position:0%
and then he got sick of tattoos so
um

06:09:15.430 --> 06:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:15.440 --> 06:09:16.150 align:start position:0%
um
i

06:09:16.150 --> 06:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:09:20.150 --> 06:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
to simplify this i i definitely hear
 
06:09:23.590 --> 06:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
the other side of this and i and i
 
06:09:24.628 --> 06:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
i just
 
06:09:27.270 --> 06:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think that in general when we create a
 
06:09:28.708 --> 06:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
law like this
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
16 is going to be too young for the
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
majority of them
 
06:09:34.150 --> 06:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:09:35.510 --> 06:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that we really need to
 
06:09:38.628 --> 06:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
protect the the kids in the the healthy
 
06:09:40.628 --> 06:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
families until 18.
 
06:09:43.590 --> 06:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
um i hear too many stories of healthy
 
06:09:45.910 --> 06:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
families that think that they're healthy
 
06:09:48.310 --> 06:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
and then their kids go off and they
 
06:09:49.590 --> 06:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
either get a
 
06:09:52.628 --> 06:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
something for an std or um
 
06:09:52.638 --> 06:09:53.670 align:start position:0%
something for an std or um
or

06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:09:55.430 --> 06:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
and you know the parent and the parents
 
06:09:57.270 --> 06:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
want to be part of that decision thank
 
06:09:57.280 --> 06:09:57.910 align:start position:0%
want to be part of that decision thank
you

06:09:57.910 --> 06:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:10:01.110 --> 06:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
06:10:02.708 --> 06:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
as i listened to what you're saying
 
06:10:02.718 --> 06:10:04.390 align:start position:0%
as i listened to what you're saying
recently

06:10:04.390 --> 06:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
recently
 
06:10:06.390 --> 06:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things i just
 
06:10:09.270 --> 06:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:12.070 --> 06:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
at 16 you're still in school
 
06:10:15.030 --> 06:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
and the schools require immunizations
 
06:10:17.110 --> 06:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
so therefore in a lot of ways what i'm
 
06:10:18.628 --> 06:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
thinking is the fact that there's a
 
06:10:20.708 --> 06:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
backdrop to this
 
06:10:23.270 --> 06:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
unless a child decides to drop out of
 
06:10:24.470 --> 06:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
school which they have to do with
 
06:10:26.230 --> 06:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
parents permission
 
06:10:27.990 --> 06:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
in essence this bill becomes moot
 
06:10:29.910 --> 06:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
because therefore the child is going to
 
06:10:31.750 --> 06:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
get immunized unless they have a medical
 
06:10:34.070 --> 06:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
exemption something like that even the
 
06:10:35.750 --> 06:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
parent really can't exempt the child
 
06:10:37.190 --> 06:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
from a vaccination when they're in
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
school is that
 
06:10:40.150 --> 06:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
there is a bill to the effect that it
 
06:10:40.160 --> 06:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
there is a bill to the effect that it
will

06:10:43.190 --> 06:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:48.150 --> 06:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:50.470 --> 06:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
some at one point and those of you who
 
06:10:52.948 --> 06:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
are better historians than i am
 
06:10:54.868 --> 06:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
it was 21.
 
06:10:57.190 --> 06:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's adulthood it's 21. we bumped it
 
06:11:00.830 --> 06:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:05.110 --> 06:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
and the statement was recently made
 
06:11:07.670 --> 06:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
it is arbitrary it's not god-given it's
 
06:11:10.390 --> 06:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
humanly devised
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
and 18 if that's the limit then the day
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
before well you can say that for 16. you
 
06:11:18.230 --> 06:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
can say that for any age if 16 is now
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
the new normal
 
06:11:21.910 --> 06:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
what about a day before that what about
 
06:11:24.390 --> 06:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
next session when somebody bumps it down
 
06:11:27.270 --> 06:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
to 14 what about when the children no
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
longer have to do what the parents say
 
06:11:31.510 --> 06:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
and somebody will and if it isn't the
 
06:11:33.670 --> 06:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
parents it might be
 
06:11:35.190 --> 06:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
the government
 
06:11:39.030 --> 06:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman speaking
 
06:11:43.190 --> 06:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
tongue-in-cheek the nice news is that if
 
06:11:45.110 --> 06:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
a kid gets to be 18 and goes into the
 
06:11:46.708 --> 06:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
army they don't have to worry about
 
06:11:49.510 --> 06:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
making a decision about immunization
 
06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
despite your mask i see your tongue in
 
06:11:53.670 --> 06:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
cheek representative kanark
 
06:11:55.190 --> 06:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much one of the things
 
06:11:57.030 --> 06:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's important to remember is that
 
06:11:59.590 --> 06:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
this has to do with obtaining
 
06:12:01.830 --> 06:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
any vaccination
 
06:12:03.510 --> 06:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
against the communicable disease we're
 
06:12:06.310 --> 06:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of discussion of covid
 
06:12:09.990 --> 06:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
but to remember that covet vaccine
 
06:12:11.910 --> 06:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
may become something that's not as
 
06:12:13.990 --> 06:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
controversial or even necessarily done
 
06:12:16.390 --> 06:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
as much or may become just a routine
 
06:12:18.310 --> 06:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
issue later on
 
06:12:19.990 --> 06:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
one of the places where this really does
 
06:12:22.230 --> 06:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
have an issue and it relates to the fact
 
06:12:24.868 --> 06:12:24.878 align:start position:0%
that we do allow children to seek std
 
06:12:27.190 --> 06:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
treatment earlier i do not think that
 
06:12:29.510 --> 06:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
includes the hpv vaccination and we do
 
06:12:31.510 --> 06:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of difficulties as the human
 
06:12:31.520 --> 06:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
have a lot of difficulties as the human
papillomavirus

06:12:33.590 --> 06:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
papillomavirus
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
where parents say well no my kid doesn't
 
06:12:37.350 --> 06:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
need to be vaccinated because they're
 
06:12:39.270 --> 06:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
not sexually active
 
06:12:41.430 --> 06:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
but the kid knows that they are sexually
 
06:12:42.788 --> 06:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
active and they may want to get
 
06:12:45.510 --> 06:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
protected against hpv
 
06:12:46.948 --> 06:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
this would allow them to go get
 
06:12:48.708 --> 06:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
protected again which i think this might
 
06:12:51.190 --> 06:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
be the thing to be most likely to really
 
06:12:53.190 --> 06:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
occur because for most other things most
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
parents aren't having a cow about
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
getting the mmr that's that's not a big
 
06:12:59.350 --> 06:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
deal i think the major place we're going
 
06:13:01.670 --> 06:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
to see this would be on hp hpv
 
06:13:04.470 --> 06:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination where the child could say i
 
06:13:07.270 --> 06:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
am active i want to be protected
 
06:13:09.430 --> 06:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
i don't want cervical cancer and i want
 
06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
to go get vaccinated for that and do
 
06:13:13.030 --> 06:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
that without telling their parents
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
because their parents may not be fond of
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
the message
 
06:13:18.948 --> 06:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
so it's for that reason that i do
 
06:13:21.350 --> 06:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
06:13:22.788 --> 06:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
because i think that's the major place
 
06:13:25.030 --> 06:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
where we might see some of this
 
06:13:28.150 --> 06:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh active changes and require that sort
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
of the need
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
even in a good functional family that
 
06:13:34.708 --> 06:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
may still be a taboo topic that would
 
06:13:36.548 --> 06:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
lead a kid to want to be vaccinated
 
06:13:38.310 --> 06:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
without their parents knowledge thank
 
06:13:40.548 --> 06:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
you representative leon did i mean
 
06:13:42.470 --> 06:13:42.480 align:start position:0%

i have
 
06:14:00.470 --> 06:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
you have
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
it is good company
 
06:14:05.750 --> 06:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you well i i thought i was pushing
 
06:14:08.150 --> 06:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
the button all the time but maybe not
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
silly me
 
06:14:13.190 --> 06:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
um we've got your back yeah thank you
 
06:14:15.350 --> 06:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
mentioning the military you have to be
 
06:14:18.948 --> 06:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
18 in order to uh join the military
 
06:14:20.788 --> 06:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
unless you have your parents permission
 
06:14:23.430 --> 06:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
right right at 17
 
06:14:25.350 --> 06:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
and which i just confirmed with
 
06:14:26.788 --> 06:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
06:14:29.510 --> 06:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i know actually my mom's husband not
 
06:14:31.990 --> 06:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
my father but a man i loved very dearly
 
06:14:32.000 --> 06:14:32.948 align:start position:0%
my father but a man i loved very dearly
actually

06:14:32.948 --> 06:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:14:35.030 --> 06:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
lied about his age and joined for world
 
06:14:36.070 --> 06:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
war ii
 
06:14:37.270 --> 06:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
into the navy
 
06:14:41.350 --> 06:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:43.670 --> 06:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know you're not i don't think you
 
06:14:46.070 --> 06:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're not as at risk and i know that
 
06:14:47.990 --> 06:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are other vaccines other than the
 
06:14:50.708 --> 06:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
covet 19 but really the the hot topic
 
06:14:53.910 --> 06:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
right now is the covid19 vaccine and we
 
06:14:56.310 --> 06:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
know that there are a lot of injuries
 
06:14:58.470 --> 06:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine injuries that are occurring and
 
06:15:00.708 --> 06:15:00.718 align:start position:0%
when i get this piece of paper in front
 
06:15:02.150 --> 06:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
of me
 
06:15:06.150 --> 06:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
and it and it uh reinforces other
 
06:15:08.548 --> 06:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
evidence that i've read and been given
 
06:15:11.830 --> 06:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
you you look at 1 million over a million
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions and 23 000 deaths
 
06:15:17.350 --> 06:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
following covet vaccines which is more
 
06:15:19.750 --> 06:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
than all previous vaccines combined i
 
06:15:21.670 --> 06:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
06:15:21.680 --> 06:15:22.470 align:start position:0%
think that that
to

06:15:22.470 --> 06:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative leon's point
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
what what if
 
06:15:29.430 --> 06:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
god forbid
 
06:15:31.590 --> 06:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
a young person goes out decides they're
 
06:15:33.350 --> 06:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
going to get a vaccine and they don't
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:41.590 --> 06:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
and the and the parents are like what
 
06:15:43.510 --> 06:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
happened and they're like well your
 
06:15:46.230 --> 06:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
child decided to go have a shot for a
 
06:15:50.868 --> 06:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine for for uh covet it i just i i
 
06:15:51.830 --> 06:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
think that
 
06:15:54.868 --> 06:15:54.878 align:start position:0%
because of the the level of risk that we
 
06:15:58.390 --> 06:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
see with this particular injection
 
06:16:01.110 --> 06:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm definitely going to be
 
06:16:03.670 --> 06:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
voting against this bill
 
06:16:05.430 --> 06:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
06:16:07.430 --> 06:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman all of this
 
06:16:09.750 --> 06:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
discussion makes me think of my my
 
06:16:11.350 --> 06:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
friend's father hal
 
06:16:14.708 --> 06:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
his family never told him that there was
 
06:16:16.868 --> 06:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
sudden cardiac death in the family and
 
06:16:18.470 --> 06:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
he never found that out because he
 
06:16:20.628 --> 06:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
dropped dead in front of his wife and
 
06:16:20.638 --> 06:16:22.230 align:start position:0%
dropped dead in front of his wife and
children

06:16:22.230 --> 06:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:16:23.670 --> 06:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons why parents aren't
 
06:16:25.270 --> 06:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
getting somebody getting their child
 
06:16:25.280 --> 06:16:26.548 align:start position:0%
getting somebody getting their child
vaccinated

06:16:26.548 --> 06:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
06:16:28.708 --> 06:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
is medical and
 
06:16:31.270 --> 06:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
is it our job it's not our job to make
 
06:16:33.350 --> 06:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
sure that those families are sharing
 
06:16:35.030 --> 06:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
what might be an outside risk whether
 
06:16:37.190 --> 06:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's uh outsized wrist because they
 
06:16:39.110 --> 06:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
might have a clotting disorder something
 
06:16:41.270 --> 06:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
else that predisposes them to an adverse
 
06:16:41.280 --> 06:16:42.548 align:start position:0%
else that predisposes them to an adverse
reaction

06:16:42.548 --> 06:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
reaction
 
06:16:42.558 --> 06:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
reaction
and

06:16:43.990 --> 06:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:16:45.910 --> 06:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
do we put those families that haven't
 
06:16:47.590 --> 06:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
shared that with their child who may
 
06:16:49.350 --> 06:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
have anxiety or other things that might
 
06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
just concern them more than they're
 
06:16:53.110 --> 06:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
willing to do before they fully launched
 
06:16:55.190 --> 06:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
as an 18 year old do we just throw out
 
06:16:59.830 --> 06:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
those families as well so i i appreciate
 
06:17:01.430 --> 06:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
wanting to make sure that there can be
 
06:17:03.430 --> 06:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
access especially for the hpv vaccine
 
06:17:05.190 --> 06:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
that might be something that
 
06:17:06.788 --> 06:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
if this doesn't pass maybe we come
 
06:17:08.230 --> 06:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
around and try and figure out if that's
 
06:17:09.670 --> 06:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
something that makes sense in the future
 
06:17:12.390 --> 06:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
because i i've i've definitely talked
 
06:17:14.470 --> 06:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
about vaccines and when you can consent
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
to the behavior that's when i'll let you
 
06:17:17.750 --> 06:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
make that choice
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that's valid
 
06:17:20.948 --> 06:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
but right now we're talking about
 
06:17:22.470 --> 06:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
students who are having their washington
 
06:17:25.590 --> 06:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
dc trip cancelled because of uncertain
 
06:17:27.990 --> 06:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination status i mean you're talking
 
06:17:29.750 --> 06:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
about a 16 year old that's dealing with
 
06:17:32.070 --> 06:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of peer pressure
 
06:17:33.590 --> 06:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
do we want to let them give in to that
 
06:17:35.590 --> 06:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
peer pressure or not and that's why i'm
 
06:17:37.750 --> 06:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to be on the side of itl hopefully
 
06:17:40.070 --> 06:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
we can consider that continue the the
 
06:17:42.390 --> 06:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about this these other cases
 
06:17:44.150 --> 06:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
but i think that that's too big a
 
06:17:45.990 --> 06:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
decision to be made outside of the
 
06:17:46.000 --> 06:17:48.548 align:start position:0%
decision to be made outside of the
parents

06:17:48.548 --> 06:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
parents
 
06:17:51.990 --> 06:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:53.910 --> 06:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
i know it's too late for talking about
 
06:17:57.270 --> 06:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:58.868 --> 06:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm looking for
 
06:18:00.868 --> 06:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
here is that
 
06:18:02.548 --> 06:18:02.558 align:start position:0%
when there's a lack of
 
06:18:04.548 --> 06:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
parental guidance
 
06:18:06.470 --> 06:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
where does the child turn to
 
06:18:07.830 --> 06:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that says they
 
06:18:10.070 --> 06:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
can go somewhere
 
06:18:11.430 --> 06:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
the only way they can do is go to court
 
06:18:13.350 --> 06:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
and become an emancipated minor which is
 
06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
a huge step to resolve something which
 
06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
could be done otherwise and there's
 
06:18:19.510 --> 06:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that says the child has
 
06:18:22.708 --> 06:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
a recourse when is that
 
06:18:24.390 --> 06:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
lack of parenting and they need
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
desperately to get a parent but they
 
06:18:30.868 --> 06:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:34.948 --> 06:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
representative folsom thank you
 
06:18:36.470 --> 06:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
06:18:39.110 --> 06:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
whenever i hear about
 
06:18:41.830 --> 06:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
people assuming that 16 year olds
 
06:18:44.310 --> 06:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
are fully capable of making some really
 
06:18:44.320 --> 06:18:45.350 align:start position:0%
are fully capable of making some really
mature

06:18:45.350 --> 06:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
mature
 
06:18:45.360 --> 06:18:46.868 align:start position:0%
mature
decisions

06:18:46.868 --> 06:18:46.878 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
06:18:49.030 --> 06:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
i often think back to
 
06:18:51.510 --> 06:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
a conversation i had with a military
 
06:18:53.030 --> 06:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
recruiter i'm not going to tell which
 
06:18:53.040 --> 06:18:55.350 align:start position:0%
recruiter i'm not going to tell which
branch

06:18:55.350 --> 06:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
branch
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i said why do you take our best why
 
06:19:02.070 --> 06:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
do you take the 18 through 25 year olds
 
06:19:04.390 --> 06:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
and he said because they think they're
 
06:19:04.400 --> 06:19:05.830 align:start position:0%
and he said because they think they're
invincible

06:19:05.830 --> 06:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
invincible
 
06:19:08.150 --> 06:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
and they'll do anything that all the
 
06:19:09.990 --> 06:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
rest of them are doing
 
06:19:13.510 --> 06:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
and you want to talk about peer pressure
 
06:19:16.948 --> 06:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
though if one guy in the squad says yeah
 
06:19:19.030 --> 06:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
let's go the rest of them just go and do
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
it even if it's one of the stupidest
 
06:19:23.910 --> 06:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
things they could possibly do
 
06:19:25.750 --> 06:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
they do it
 
06:19:29.190 --> 06:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
my boys
 
06:19:33.190 --> 06:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
have a few tattoos
 
06:19:36.708 --> 06:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:39.270 --> 06:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
very prominent large tattoos
 
06:19:43.110 --> 06:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
expressing certain opinions on things
 
06:19:45.750 --> 06:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
and now it's going to cost them a whole
 
06:19:47.670 --> 06:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
bunch of money if they want them taken
 
06:19:49.110 --> 06:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
off which
 
06:19:52.150 --> 06:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
now they're saving their money to do
 
06:19:52.160 --> 06:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
now they're saving their money to do
so

06:19:53.350 --> 06:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:19:54.948 --> 06:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
i really
 
06:19:58.070 --> 06:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
i really cannot go with 16 year olds
 
06:19:59.670 --> 06:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
making a decision
 
06:20:01.990 --> 06:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
of putting something in their body they
 
06:20:04.708 --> 06:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
cannot take back out
 
06:20:08.230 --> 06:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
a tattoo as much as i regret it at least
 
06:20:10.070 --> 06:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
you can spend a lot of money and make
 
06:20:12.390 --> 06:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
plastic surgeons happy
 
06:20:14.868 --> 06:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
by getting them erased
 
06:20:17.350 --> 06:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
you cannot erase
 
06:20:18.708 --> 06:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
an injection
 
06:20:24.468 --> 06:20:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:26.548 --> 06:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
point of order it does not work on your
 
06:20:29.510 --> 06:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
dna i'm sorry but that is simply
 
06:20:30.788 --> 06:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
false and i'm going to have to make a
 
06:20:32.548 --> 06:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
point of order it does not work on your
 
06:20:35.110 --> 06:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
dna whatsoever
 
06:20:36.868 --> 06:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't work on the irony it is
 
06:20:39.990 --> 06:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
rna but it does not affect rna may i
 
06:20:41.190 --> 06:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
actually make one other point of order
 
06:20:43.670 --> 06:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
just just this same clarification the
 
06:20:46.390 --> 06:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
various reports again do not imply
 
06:20:47.910 --> 06:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
causality at all
 
06:20:50.390 --> 06:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
they are mandated if there's any death
 
06:20:53.350 --> 06:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
and in the 17
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
sorry 14 deaths between ages 12 and 17
 
06:20:57.990 --> 06:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
06:20:59.430 --> 06:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
again remember two of them were from
 
06:20:59.440 --> 06:21:00.868 align:start position:0%
again remember two of them were from
suicide

06:21:00.868 --> 06:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
06:21:02.310 --> 06:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
that was not because they got the covet
 
06:21:04.390 --> 06:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine and none of them have actually
 
06:21:07.590 --> 06:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
upon full detail and an investigation
 
06:21:09.590 --> 06:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
have been proven to be caused by the
 
06:21:11.590 --> 06:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine although there are still a few
 
06:21:13.350 --> 06:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
where their full information is pending
 
06:21:16.948 --> 06:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:18.468 --> 06:21:18.478 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're about ready to stop
 
06:21:19.830 --> 06:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
kicking this one down the road but
 
06:21:21.590 --> 06:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
06:21:23.510 --> 06:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and just a point of order as
 
06:21:25.190 --> 06:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
well because of the crossover and the
 
06:21:26.708 --> 06:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
initial study
 
06:21:28.708 --> 06:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
the vares is not a perfect system at all
 
06:21:30.548 --> 06:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
but it's pretty much the only long-term
 
06:21:32.230 --> 06:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up we have so we have to take it
 
06:21:33.750 --> 06:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
warts and all
 
06:21:35.670 --> 06:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
and no it has warts are you ready for
 
06:21:37.190 --> 06:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
the question
 
06:21:39.110 --> 06:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
question before us
 
06:21:41.510 --> 06:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1126
 
06:21:44.788 --> 06:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
the motion is itl
 
06:21:46.310 --> 06:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
so if you don't like the bill you vote
 
06:21:48.788 --> 06:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
yes if you like the bill you vote no
 
06:21:51.030 --> 06:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's how sometimes things work and we
 
06:21:53.670 --> 06:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
all get confused with that so
 
06:21:53.680 --> 06:21:54.548 align:start position:0%
all get confused with that so
um

06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
um

twelve to seven i'm i now i'm starting
 
06:22:58.868 --> 06:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
to count if they're not unanimous so i
 
06:23:02.708 --> 06:23:02.718 align:start position:0%
don't miss make mistakes you know
 
06:23:04.468 --> 06:23:04.478 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of us wish we could could
 
06:23:05.990 --> 06:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
have squared this circle because that's
 
06:23:08.310 --> 06:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
who we are and what we do and we really
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
know we have two hands as in on the
 
06:23:12.628 --> 06:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
other hand and i appreciate those as
 
06:23:14.628 --> 06:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
saying maybe we need to come back
 
06:23:16.628 --> 06:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
with something another time particularly
 
06:23:18.150 --> 06:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
on the points that a
 
06:23:21.190 --> 06:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
few of my colleagues made um with that i
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
closed the executive session on 11 26
 
06:23:27.350 --> 06:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
and close at today's business we'll see
 
06:23:32.628 --> 06:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:43.030 --> 06:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
