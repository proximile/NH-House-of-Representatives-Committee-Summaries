00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome to uh today's
 
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
hearings in the health and human
 
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
services and elderly Affairs committee
 
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh this is going to start looking like
 
00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
more of a typical day in the state house
 
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh back when we were running from
 
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
committee to committee so we'll have
 
00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
committee members coming and going as
 
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
necessary introducing bills testifying
 
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and coming back fortunately we
 
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
now have the YouTube recording so nobody
 
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
will have to miss a testimony so this is
 
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
a huge benefit to what we're doing now
 
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
today um and with that I will open the
 
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1706 FN and I will

you good morning honorable committee

members um my name is Julius soti
 
00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
representing uh the Rockingham 35 the
 
00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 align:start position:0%
towns of London der and both
 
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
pronunciations of Windham and Windam
 
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's an inside joke over there um
 
00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
uh my testimony here is going to be for
 
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
the informed consent bill which I am
 
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored but my testimony is also
 
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
relevant to the following bill so it'll
 
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
be covering both
 
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
topics um also want to make a point that
 
00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan bill and I want to give a
 
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
overview of the topic here of what
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
circumcision is and where it came from
 
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
so the hisor
 
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.350 align:start position:0%
so the hisor
overview

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
overview
 
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be brief with it because
 
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of
 
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
other people to flesh it out so what is
 
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
circumcision circumcision is the cutting
 
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
off or amputation of the foreskin of the
 
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
penis where did this come
 
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
from it's a religious ceremony performed
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
by Jews and also observed by
 
00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
Muslims it's a right of passage in a few
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
African tribes and it's performed in the
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
early teen years
 
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
and make no mistake it is meant to be
 
00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
painful a test of
 
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
manhood that's a test um maybe I'd stay
 
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
a kid um I don't think knife and penis
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
should be uttered in the same
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
sentence very cringy
 
00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
um so circumcision is not a thing in the
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
rest of the world and it wasn't a thing
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
back then either uh in in the
 
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
past but in the later half for the 1800s
 
00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 align:start position:0%
in the english- speaking world it was uh
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
sold as a medical practice a Panacea for
 
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
anything that ails you we got your cure
 
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
right here hypersexuality check got you
 
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
covered uh can't not find time to bathe
 
00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 align:start position:0%
check got you cover there too alcohol
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
problem yeah it'll do that too epilepsy
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
yep snake oil and quackery all rolled
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
into one thus the beginning of the
 
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
demonization of the forkin
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
well um oh which by the way does serve a
 
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
purpose but I'm sure I have a lot of
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
Heavy Hitters behind me they'll explain
 
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
that part
 
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
later uh fast forward to the day and The
 
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
Jig Is up it's on the way out infant
 
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
circumcision is no longer routinely
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
practiced in uh English-speaking Nations
 
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
like England gave it up Canada Australia
 
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
and it's also on the way out in a few
 
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
states in the
 
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
US but today we still have a these
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
bitter cling who
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
are uh clinging to the
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
practice uh circumcision is still a cure
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
in search of a disease an answer to a
 
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
problem that does not
 
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
science uh that and that's what you're
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing from the other side
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
what other body part do we do this with
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
none but let's play the game uh let's do
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
teeth let's pull out your teeth prevent
 
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
tooth decay tonsils and take that out
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
too or breast buds for both girls and
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
boys because it prevents breast cancer
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the cost benefits analysis each of
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
these would be far more meaningful
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
circumcision I want to move to uh some
 
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh quotes from various public
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
figures on this issue first I'm going to
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
go with h i on her Lee she's uh from
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
Somalia uh she was um suffer or she
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
was uh she had the female genital
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
mutilation performed on her and um he
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
left Somalia became a politician in
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
Europe and is a human rights
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
activist here's the quote from
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
her the foreskin is cut off the penis
 
00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's a form of
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
Mutilation you should leave the child as
 
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
he is as he came in out of the womb he's
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
finished he's complete
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't take things off especially
 
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
if there's no medical
 
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
reason and we have uh George Carlin the
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
comedian in his
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
Memoirs last words that's it is PG
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
rated quote from Carlin I also survived
 
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
circumcision the barbaric practice
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
designed to remind you that uh as early
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
as possible that your genitalia is not
 
00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.029 align:start position:0%
as possible that your genitalia is not
your

00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
own that's certainly a case for my body
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
my choice right there uh then I also
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
have some well Richard Dawkins the
 
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 align:start position:0%
biologist he has some
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
Twitter posts uh which I'll I'll pass
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
this around because and then the author
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
journalist pist Christopher Hitchens
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's also one I'd rather not
 
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
read um panette from his uh TV program
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh pen and tellers BS uh they did an
 
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
episode on
 
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
circumcision and the quote there is vast
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
majority of the world knows there's no
 
00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 align:start position:0%
reason to circumcise someone should tell
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
the doctors the US doctors that is uh
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
put down the knife step away from the
 
00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
baby uh Joe Rogan okay I'm not gonna
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
read his for the quotes if you can
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
circulate that because you said that you
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
went copies and then if you just want to
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
either speak to the content of the bill
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
um oh just one more quote well actually
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
two more quotes and I'm done okay thank
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
you um Howard Stern radio personality
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
never thought i' be quoting him he's of
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
Jewish origin and this is his view on it
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
I am circumcised and I tell you
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
something I despise it I despise it I
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
despise it I'm completely pissed off
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
that I'm
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
circumcised and uh
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
finally uh from the
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist uh and noted debunker many
 
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
science myths Thomas SAS also of uh
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
Jewish origin I believe that the time
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
has come to acknowledge that the
 
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
practice of routine circumcision rests
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
on the Absurd premise that the only male
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
in creation born in the condition that
 
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
requires surgical correction is the
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
human male so another words it's not a
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
birth effect in fact
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
um condition where you are born without
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
a poor skin and there is such condition
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
that is generally listed as a birth
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
defect so with that um I end my
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't think I answer any
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
questions quite yet I'll wait till the
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
end if necessary because I got have a
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
lot of Heavy Hitters who are on The
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge of this issue thank you
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
very much representative sodi uh next
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call the call Representative
 
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.509 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call the call Representative
Emily

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
Emily
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
Phillips and after that it'll be
 
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.190 align:start position:0%
Phillips and after that it'll be
representative

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
burough I was just hoping Madam chair
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
that that people who testify can be
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
directed to turn very quickly to the
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
substance of the bill that's in front of
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
us because the point about the actual
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
surgery itself has been wellmade and and
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
I we have all taken the point very
 
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
clearly to heart so representative Weber
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that they were he was setting
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
the table for that so that everybody
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
else can speak to the content of the
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
bill and we will be going back to having
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
three minutes um then the committee may
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
ask questions as well so I will start
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
with that representative Phillips and
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
your microphone's off just so you
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um my name is
 
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
Emily Phillips I represent Rockingham
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
District 7 Fremont New Hampshire I am
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the informed
 
00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:04.030 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the informed
consent

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
Bill how do you write a wrong um
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can't so in my role as an
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
elected official I decided to put in
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
meaningful legislation to ensure parents
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
are educated to prevent future
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
wrongs I am a regret
 
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
mom you prepare for your firstborn child
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
and you go through lots of imaginary uh
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
scenarios and how you're going to be as
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
a parent how you're going to care for
 
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
your newborn baby what labor and
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
delivery will look like um nobody
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
prepares you for the wound care involved
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
when you choose circumcision for your
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
son that um was a startling process for
 
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
me um in my postpartum Haze uh I don't I
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
think most of you can agree that
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
nobody's in their right mind after
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
giving birth um we're sleep deprived
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
we're um healing from our own surgical
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
wounds or the birth process and um there
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
was no way for me to absorb any kind of
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know informed consent had it been
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
given to me about uh the choice of
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
circumcision my my son was born healthy
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
um and about 24 hours old they uh a
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
nurse came into my room and said from my
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
recollection you know it's time for his
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
newborn screen do you want him
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
circumcised my husband at the time and I
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
um chose yes we do we didn't know we
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
didn't even think it was an option to
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
not uh that was just normal in our
 
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.790 align:start position:0%
not uh that was just normal in our
culture

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
culture
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
um they took him uh he was returned to
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
us I don't remember signing anything I'm
 
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
sure I did I'm sure I S signed some sort
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
of uh invasive procedure General consent
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
form obviously this I delivered at
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
exitor hospital I'm sure they gave me
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
some sort of sign off for this um he was
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
returned to me uh he was all right uh a
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
couple hours later uh he became very
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
distressed uh he was um crying and 24
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
hours before he was just a normal like
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
healthy sleepy baby um
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
he the nurse came in and said we're
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
worried about his respiratory rate uh he
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
was having very fast uh rapid breathing
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
and we said we don't know what's going
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
on but something's wrong so they took
 
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
him from our room which at the time they
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
had a baby friendly policy so the baby
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
stays in the room with you and they took
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
him from us and they put him in the
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
Special Care
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
Nursery uh for 5 days um and they could
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
not figure out what was wrong with him
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
he was just upset um so uh they put a
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
um an IV in his head say as babies it's
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
hard to get an IV so they put an IV and
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
gave him sugar water trying to he he was
 
00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959 align:start position:0%
not breastfeeding so back then your new
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
mom trying to learn how to breastfeed so
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
they do a tummy to tummy uh when they
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
when you try to breastfeed and I I'm
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
assuming looking back on it now that his
 
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
wound hurt him after the hours after the
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
local anesthetic would have worn off and
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
he was distressed and it was hard for
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
him to breastfeed so they taught me how
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
to do what's called the football hold
 
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
which some of the moms will understand
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
but basically they lay behind you and
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
their belly is up to the ceiling so I
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't making contact with his wound um
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
and he was able to kind of breastfeed
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
and we eventually got out of there he
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
had ja us which may or may not be
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
related to uh the procedure um but again
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
the wound care I was not prepared for um
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
constant attention and cleaning him and
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh repairing uh what I chose to do him
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
lasted at least two years um I
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
never like had a healthy child uh when
 
00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
it comes to his genitals after that and
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
um we were referred to a top pediatric
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
urologist in Manchester um sometime
 
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
before he turned one because he had
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
issues um I don't want to say
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
specifically but he had complications
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
and she said we could offer a repair
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
procedure like a new circumcision or
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
something or we could um wait and maybe
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
by the time he was walking or maybe when
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
he reaches puberty it would resolve um
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
so obviously after that trauma we chose
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
not to do anything and just wait because
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
um why put him through more uh two
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
nights ago in my research I found out
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
one of my son's conditions is listed as
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
a diagnosis code for revisions and
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
repairs in this state under the Medicaid
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
um Billings so I know now um he turns 11
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
next week and I know now that we're not
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
done so I have to go back um and find
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
somebody to help us um I will spend the
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
rest of my life uh in regret and um I
 
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
hope he forgives me and I have to have
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
this conversation with him because he
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what's going on but um I uh
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
went on to have two more children my
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
last son he's two and a half he's intact
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
and no health issues no special care no
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
trauma I'm wrapping up I promise um I
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to be
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
open um to this discussion um because
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
infant circumcision is the only routine
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
surgery performed on healthy infants
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
that is not medically necessary so
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's why a special form is required
 
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
according to Dr uh David Jones who
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here of University of
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
Vermont Medical Center uh Medicade and
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
other thirdparty payers um require
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
specific consent forms for other
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
elective procedur is like tual ligations
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
and vasectomies and that's why we need a
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%

conversation to happen and I'd prefer
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
not to take any questions because I feel
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
like there's plenty of people and a lot
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
of people to get through I'm sure that
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%

burrow

00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you committee members
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
for having me testify um state repita
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
burrow as I represent Carol too and I'm
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition to this bill um
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
my assertion is that HB 1706 does not
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
provide the complete story about this
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
procedure and potential medical benefits
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
there is a directive in the bill for
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS to provide medical care experts
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
with an intact care guide with
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
information to inform parents on the
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
proper care of an intact penis my
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
question is since when does DHHS provide
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
medical experts and healthc Care
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
institutions with directives on what
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
information to give P patients are we
 
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
doing this with heart surgery tonsilitis
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
appendectomies the healthc care provider
 
00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
must also furnish parents with a
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive consent form with a
 
00:16:28.829 --> 00:16:28.839 align:start position:0%
two-person signature required with it
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
the circumcision cannot be proceeded
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
again is such a consent form created by
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
a government since when is a government
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
is a consent form created by a
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
government agency to Health Care
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
Providers a requirement for any other
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
procedure the parents must be shown the
 
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
restraining board clamp and plastic all
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
used in the procedure do we require
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
parents to be shown the scalpel graspers
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
and needle drivers for an act
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
appendectomy the bill states that
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
circumcision is an unnecessary cosmetic
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
procedure however major healthc care
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
institutions including the CDC National
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
Institute of Health and American
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Association which asserts that
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
the benefits outweigh the risk state
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
that there's a decreased risk of urinary
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
tract infections decreased risk of
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted diseases and
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
prevention of penile problems including
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
the inflammation of the fores skim
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
although we did hear opposing SE
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
testimony today from how Howard Stern
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
and George Carlin which I I appreciate
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
um there are disciplinary procedures
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
delineated if these procedures are not
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
carried out by the physi by The
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
Physician or medical professional
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
including referral to a licensing board
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
and potential monetary penalties is this
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
not the purview of the medical
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
institutions since when is this
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature regulates
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
now it's been mentioned Jews and Muslims
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
have been performing this right of
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
circumcision for thousands of year years
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
and many P parents opt to have this
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
procedure done in the hospital but this
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
bill would not allow this relig just
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
custom to be done in a medical office
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
and I ask could this be interfering with
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
our state Constitution Article 5 we're
 
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:07.799 align:start position:0%
the parental right stand in this bill
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
should parents be the Arbiters of
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not to have their babies
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
circumcised why do they need to hoop
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
jump through legislative Hoops in order
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
to have this procedure in closing to my
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge most of our 400 legislators do
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
not have medical degrees it's time for
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
the state house to get out of the
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
doctor's office and Healthcare
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
institutions and leave such is issues
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
such as in sent informed consent and
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
disciplinary procedures where they
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
belong and stop interference with the
 
00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
doctor patient relationship thank
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%

Hampshire legislator in the House of
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives I'm here today as a
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
nurse with nearly 15 years of experience
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
in women's Maternal Child Health with
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
significant experience in mental health
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
specific to the reproductive years um I
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
am the nurse that gets consent I take
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
the baby to the board where they will be
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
strapped down and I sooe the babies
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
during the procceed procedure so I have
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
firsthand knowledge of this process from
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
the inside out how it would impact
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
clinicians and new parents with real
 
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
clinicians and new parents with real
world

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
application sorry sometimes I need
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
glasses sometimes I don't getting to
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
that age um from the beginning 15 years
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
ago I noticed a significant Gap in
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
education um and I have some insight as
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
to why so while all of the and and the
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
fact is that all of the professional
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
organ ganizations such as the American
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics and the American
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
College of Obstetricians and
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
gynecologists all agree that
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
circumcision is medically unnecessary
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
it's a well-known and accepted standard
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
from the obes the nurses this is
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
something we all know to be true and
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is how we educate our patients and
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
this is how we are instructed in to
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
educate them that this is not medically
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
necessary but it is their choice and I
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
strongly believe in parent choice the
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
problem is that there's a gap in the
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
education one of the reasons being that
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh people do not have pediatricians
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
until after they have the baby so who's
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
going to educate them while the obes or
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
The Midwives and the nurses are very
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
very good and are well- intended they're
 
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
bogged down with so much and they
 
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
frankly don't have a good source of
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
Education this is well accepted in
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
society and a lot of people don't do
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
research before they come to the
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
hospital they don't even know really
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
that circumcision is an option so um
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
with that Gap I think this is a really
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
important opportunity to supply the
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
community with input um on this health
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
information um I feel uh strongly um I'm
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
concerned when I do this I don't think
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
that people are getting the right
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
information that I feel comfortable
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
they're making informed consent um
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
because it simply isn't there at the
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
same time I do agree with with the
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
representative who just came up um I
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
feel very strongly that it's not our
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
role as legislators to interfere with
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
medical practice I do think it's our job
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
to uh make sure that information gets
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
out there and I I don't have too much
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
longer so don't worry um I've been
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
thinking about this deeply over the last
 
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
few weeks and I do have a recommendation
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
I would recommend um that this bill be
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
simply ified to include a consent that
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
is specific to circumcision right now
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
most of the consent forms are uh consent
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
for a general invasive procedure they
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't have anything specific to
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
circumcision my recommendation would be
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
that we create a form that is um that
 
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
that is specific to that and on that
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
form would be a box where people can
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
check that they have received a brochure
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
with education and that they understand
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
it now um the other thing is that the
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
state and the federal government already
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
do regulate many of these there are
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
forms and education that are required
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
such as uh helping people know about
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
Shak and baby syndrome and sudden infant
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
death syndrome so there is required
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
education and forms and processes I
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we talk with DHHS
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
so that we can see if they would create
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
a brochure that is congruent in language
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
and sentiment for the brochures they
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
already create so would be congruent
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
with all the education people get in the
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
postpartum period that would be
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
consistent across the state everybody
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
gets that education and then the consent
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
form is processed the way all the forms
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
already are thank you thank you are
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
there any
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
um you're a nurse who does this so you
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
know much more about it than myself um
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
but my question is
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
um while you've described this
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
essentially as an elective procedure um
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
which I would totally agree with you
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
about um is it not true that if one goes
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
looking through the research that one
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
would find
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
um conflicting research about the
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
medical benefits of of
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
circumcision not I'm not making an
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
argument one way or the other I'm just
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
saying wouldn't one find in the research
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
um that circumcision as a pro procedure
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
has medical benefits as well as a lot of
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
research that says it doesn't or it's
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
more harmful than beneficial sure so
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
there so again the the presiding um
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
professional organizations that dictate
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
most of my practice um agree that it is
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
medically unnecessary now in in previous
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
years when it was very culturally
 
00:24:57.159 --> 00:24:58.430 align:start position:0%
years when it was very culturally
accepted

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
um organizations would say something to
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
the effect and this is what you might
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
find um it's medically
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
unnecessary benefits May outweigh the
 
00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:09.799 align:start position:0%
risks most organizations are moving away
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
from that type of statement um a lot of
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
the research I've been I've been
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
researching it for 15 years I'm a I'm a
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
newborn care educator um a lot of the
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
research that was done that indicates
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
that it decreases things like STI HIV um
 
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.549 align:start position:0%
that it decreases things like STI HIV um
and

00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
UTI um were often done in populations
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
that don't have the same hygienic um
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
environments as us so they had increased
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
risk or they were in environments where
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
they were exposed to more of those
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
things that we talked about um so again
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
it's generally accepted by the
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
professionals that the best research out
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
there very much indicates that this is
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
not medically
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
followup then representative mlan after
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
that and then King thank you madam chair
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
I have a a different question
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
so um I'll have representative mlan then
 
00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King and then
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
representa Shapiro
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
again uh thank you uh Madam chair and
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I do have concerns about how
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
consent is often gained in my personal
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
experience it's often been a rubber
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
stamp and so I have enormous Sympathy
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
for the testimony of Representative
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
Phillips who she's under state of duress
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
almost and she's being asked to put
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
things forward so on the consent side
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
which is what this is focusing on you
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
talked about education um so this bill
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
as written it does create a special
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
unique consent form for circumcision but
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
would it do anything to address the
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
situation that representative Phillips
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
found herself in where yes I have a a
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated form but it's being put in
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
front of me again in the state of duress
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
so do do do you see anything in this
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
bill that would address that concern or
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
no uh I recommend um uh reworking the
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
bill a bit to um focus a little bit less
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
on the consent although I think it's
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
very important that it's a specific
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
circumcision consent but I think that to
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
even it out we've got to have a specific
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
brochure that is written that improves
 
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039 align:start position:0%
the education unfortunately this whole
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
concept of educating people before the
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
postpartum time is a cultural problem we
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
we that is one of the major problems
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things that makes this
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
the most dangerous country to have a
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
baby um in the industrialized world so I
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
could say the exact same thing people
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
come in and want to breastfeed and they
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
haven't looked up how to breastfeed they
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
come in wanting a natural birth and they
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
haven't educated themselves on how to
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
manage pain so I think the best that we
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
can do when they're in that state is at
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
the very least give them a bro sure and
 
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
what we know is we repeat things over
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
and over so we mentioned something about
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
a Circ at the beginning and give a
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
little education we give the brochure we
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
give them time to look at it um rather
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
than somebody coming in you just woke up
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
the doctor's coming in at 6:00 a.m.
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
they're kind of throwing something in
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
front of you they need to know now
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they're doing the cirs now so if
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
we give it to them I think you know they
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
can take it and say okay wait let let us
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
look at this for a few more hours before
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
we decide and they can take that time of
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
the day um they can take the time they
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
need to really look at it and ask the
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
nurse questions I I actually think this
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
would be very well accepted and very
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
helpful for doctors and nurses and
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
midwives thank you representative King
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
for for um coming here today and giving
 
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:48.519 align:start position:0%
your testimony I hope you get lots of
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
questions because I really like the fact
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
that you've got both Real World
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
experience as a nurse and also uh
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
legislative experience and a parent and
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
and a parent um of two boys this is
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
probably something I could look up on
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
Google um I haven't done it yet but I'm
 
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
just really curious because in the Bible
 
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:09.799 align:start position:0%
it's clear that their per the um their
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
the circumcision is supposed to be
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
performed at 8 days after birth um and
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
it sounds like um a lot of circumcisions
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
nowadays are being done the day of birth
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
is that correct and and how did that
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
happen how did it go from clearly 8 days
 
00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
of that baby being able to heal itself
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
from just being born and the the parents
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
being you know uh of right mind to all
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
of a sudden like birth circumcision sure
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
sure um a few and thank you for that
 
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919 align:start position:0%
question I'm still getting used to the
 
00:29:42.919 --> 00:29:44.590 align:start position:0%
question I'm still getting used to the
decorum

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
decorum
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the whole history from
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
the Bible days to now in how
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
circumcision has developed but I do have
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
a few answers to your question um one is
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
um I mean we can't can't have a whole
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
debate on Healthcare right um but people
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
are in the hospital that that's where
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
they are they're there um I will tell
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
you um I know that some of the standards
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
of practice are that boys are allowed to
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
get the circumcision as long as they're
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
six hours old so that is pretty much the
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
earliest they could get the
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
circumcision um my my guess and again
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
this is a guess is that um you know
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're removed from from the Bible if I
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
could interrupt for just a moment uh we
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people testifying I I I
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you're providing more
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
than you know but if you can stick to
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
what you know I'd appreciate that we
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
have three more questions for you after
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I I will say this the people are in
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
the hospital at that time and if they
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
leave they're unlikely to come back it's
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
harder it's more
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
complicated representative Shapiro and
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
then representative Weber thank you
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair um so on page two
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
line8 it says um one of the requirements
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
of this of the process of um informed
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
consent would be um that the parents
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
have seen the circumcision devices to be
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
used and the parents still wish to
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
proceed with the circumcision of the
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
child so I have two questions for you
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
about that yes is that outside of the
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
norm of informed consent for most
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
procedures to actually view the tools of
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
the procedure that's the first question
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the second question is someone who
 
00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.710 align:start position:0%
and the second question is someone who
obviously

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
does this and is um very attuned to the
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
um emotional state of the people you're
 
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with um how would you feel about
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
actually doing that yeah so um when I
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
read the bill I I had a similar reaction
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is uh from the
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
logistical Point as well that would be
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
impossible for us to do in the hospital
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
we don't have time to be bringing that
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
to every patient sterilizing it again
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
doing the procedure um my recommendation
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
would be that if if if if people feel
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
strongly to include that that it would
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
just be a picture um on the on the
 
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
brochure I I can't speak to how many
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
other procedures do something like that
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
um but I do think that there's a lack of
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of what it is and that
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
could potentially um that could
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
potentially inform people um what I will
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
say is another reason I like the
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
brochure is because to speak to the
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
sensitivity and and emotional state
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
especially firsttime parents they are
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
very very um they want to be a good
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
parent and they're very sensitive and
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
when we go in with something
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
controversial such as to teach them
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
about breastfeeding and formula no
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
matter how neutral you go in they
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
usually have a defense mechanism and I
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
think if we're if we go too strong with
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
this I I I don't want to be the nurse
 
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
that has to talk to them about this um
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
so I want to be really careful because I
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
do think it can be a very emotional
 
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
state for them and just like our
 
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative you know in that fog and
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
with those emotional hormones I think we
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
should be very
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
careful representative sorry the
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
information needs to be said but very
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
carefully thank you representative Weber
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you very much Madam chair
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question am
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
I really getting the sense from your
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that what might be more useful
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
than some of the prescriptive stuff
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
currently contained in the bill as
 
00:33:39.629 --> 00:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
written that what we should be aiming at
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
for all parents is earlier education and
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
education significantly in advance of
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
the birth process so that it's one of
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
those things that they have had a
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
chance to consider to prepare for and to
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
be a able to make a decision that's not
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
that here I am you've got to make a
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
decision right
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
now is if if would that be in your
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism short answer yes real answer I
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's realistic this is
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
one this is one extremely small piece of
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
everything else that people don't get
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
right they they don't they don't get in
 
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
if you don't take a class you don't even
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
know what the stages and phases of Labor
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
are you don't know what pin is you don't
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
know what increases your risk of
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
cesarian you don't know what
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding is you don't know you know
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is this is everything um so this is
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
about that would be about fixing the
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
entire system I have lots of ideas on
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
that um but in the existing system with
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
the existing time that our clinicians
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
have I think this is the best option
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Murphy
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and thank you
 
00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um just simple
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned medically
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
unnecessary a couple times I just want
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
to make it clear you're you're not
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
equating that to medically
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
contraindicated are you no no it would
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
be more neutral meaning um it's not
 
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.670 align:start position:0%
be more neutral meaning um it's not
necessary

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow so if you can look at a procedure
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
any elective procedure as quote
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
medically unkown necessary which I would
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
argue the majority of procedures are
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
elective procedures would you then be
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
based on what you were trying to how how
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
to amend this bill would you then
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
suggest that every procedure that is
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
done in an operating room the the
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
surgeon in or the people taking care of
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
him show the patient all the equipment
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
and um all of the other aspects of the
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
surgery that they may encounter during
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
the procedure um we're getting a little
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
far off from
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
thist the other areas I'm not an expert
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
in what should happen I know parents and
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
I am also I've been educating for 10
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
years I teach child birth Ed classes I
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
teach perinatal mental health I teach
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
newborn care I know what is good for
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
parents in that time period thank
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank yes you can make a suggestion um I
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
would suggest that perhaps we um
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
consider right now that that this might
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
be a bill that might go to subcommittee
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
because it sounds to me like there are
 
00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
any number of real specifics with the
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
bill that might well be better off
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
discussed in a a forum with more time so
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
that people can be heard now um is that
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
helpful I recognize that however we have
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of members from the public who are
 
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
here to speak on this topic um and it's
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
great to have the input from one
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
legislator but we need to look at how
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
this committee as a whole will be
 
00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with this bill as we move
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
forward but but obviously all
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
considerations remain on the table uh
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much representative
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you and we've already
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
recognized you for two questions
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro sorry
 
00:37:09.069 --> 00:37:09.079 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel you have a question
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Madame chairman and
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I this
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
question may be for a lot of different
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
people I really really really appreciate
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
everything you said about informed
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
consent I think it's a huge problem but
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's not unique to this procedure um
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
according to the national health
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
statistics report from the CDC in 2010
 
00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.630 align:start position:0%
statistics report from the CDC in 2010
48.3

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
48.3
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
million procedures were formed in the
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
United States and this is where my
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
concern comes in um should we be writing
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
a separate statute for the tens and
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of procedures that are done
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
every year that we don't provide
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
informed consent for or is there a
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
better non you've already outlined a
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
non-legislative way of doing this is
 
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
there a better way in process now to
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
statute I again I can't speak to all of
 
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079 align:start position:0%
the other procedures I can speak to this
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
I can say we have specifics on things
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
that are extremely important for the
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
newborn such as the risks and benefits
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
of breastfeeding and formula sudden
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
infant death syndrome shaking baby
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
syndrome and
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
um this is something the one thing
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's difference between this and most
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
other elective procedures is this is a
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
newborn infant who is not doesn't have
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to give consent for
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
their body autonomy and I do think that
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
that is a good reason to
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
consider extra education on this
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
area thank you very much um see are we
 
00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
done yes we're done thank you very much
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
for hearing me and of course I'm
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
available for any other questions at any
 
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.430 align:start position:0%
available for any other questions at any
time

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
Sardi and uh I'll make sure that my
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
three minute timer is a little bit
 
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
louder I want to be respectful to every
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
single one of these every single person
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
speak hi can you hear me
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
hi okay um I'm going to try to shorten
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
this and really kind of speak to I think
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
some of the gaps um and inconsistencies
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
that have already um been brought up so
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's what you're could you
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
sorry could you say your name um my name
 
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.990 align:start position:0%
sorry could you say your name um my name
is

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
Lauren and also speak a little closer to
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
the microphone so we can make sure that
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
you my name is Lauren Sardi I'm a
 
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
professor of sociology and women's and
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
gender studies at quak University in
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampton Connecticut I'm speaking to you
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
first as a scholar and a researcher I've
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
spent the last 17 years of my academic
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
career beginning in graduate school at
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
the University of Connecticut studying
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
the ethics and human rights implications
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
of neonato penile circumcision and the
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
ways in which this procedure has been
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
maintained and upheld in our society
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is done even though all national
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
and international health and medical
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
organizations note that the procedure
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
above all else is cosmetic which we have
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
already established um um and secondly
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to you all as a parent um I
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
support both um bills that are in front
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
of legislator this morning um and I'd
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
like to sort of briefly explain
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
why obviously as we've covered before
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
penal circumcision has commonly been
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
described as a routine procedure
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
performed shortly after birth at least
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
in the United States in my previous
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
research on medical providers and
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
parents I asked what the most common
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
reasons were for parents to approve a
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
circumcision on their child um I'm going
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
to list some of these reasons below
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
briefly and also kind of talk about sort
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
of like why these are a little bit off
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
um and then explain sort of why this is
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
all kind of a moot point anyways because
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the concept of
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
informed consent um this is actually a
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
misnomer as it applies to neonatal
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
circumcision um but I'll get into that
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
in a little bit um we talk about things
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
like basic hygiene um it is much less
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
invasive on a person to just simply be
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
able to bathe themselves use mild soap
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
when appropriate we talk about uh you
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
know this common um uh phrase that gets
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
tossed around um that circumcision um
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
prevents UTI um what we actually find is
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
that you'd have to perform 100
 
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
circumcisions to prevent one case of a
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
UTI um and certainly if a child with a
 
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
vula has a UTI what do we do we
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
prescribe antibiotics we do not
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
circumcise them um again we talk talk
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
about these lowered risks of um HPV and
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
STI other types of STI preventions um
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
even if you're circumcised you still
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
need to use barrier protection that is
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
actually the only um true way to
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually fully um you know attempt to
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
prevent these kinds of um infections and
 
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
and diseases as they later may occur um
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
from a public health perspective uh
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
these are easy to obtain easy to use
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
cost-effective and does not result in
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
the permanent removal of a part of a
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
we also get into other things like
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
aesthetic preferences uh matching the
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
father uh things like that which are all
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
culturally um uh cultural considerations
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
um parents actually should not allow
 
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
their own preferences of genital
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
appearance to be literally circumscribed
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
on their infant children as a society I
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
think we would feel disgusted if we
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
heard uh parents discussing aesthetic
 
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
preferences of infants born with vulvas
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
and so I will admit it's a bit
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
perplexing that we do not have the same
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
response for those parents who have
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
children born with
 
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
penises um so there's a lot of other
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
reasons here that I could list but what
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
I really want to talk about is that you
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
know people also give this argument of
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
well what if they just have to get it
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
done later on in life um and what I
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
would say is that based on the the best
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
estimates that we have um only one out
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
of roughly 16,000 adults with a penis
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
need to be circumcised as an adult and I
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
say need like there's medical necessity
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
simply put neonatal circumcision is not
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
ever an appropriate prophylactic
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
procedure to be done on neonates or
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
frankly anyone who is too young to give
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
direct consent in fact circumcision is
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
literally the only procedure in the
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
world in which parents are able to
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
provide proxy consent to an elective
 
00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
procedure no less one that permanently
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
Alters one one's body forever so truly
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
informed consent as described in medical
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
ethics the kind of informed consent we
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
all get as adults for both medically
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
necessary and cosmetic procedures at
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
least in theory is not able to be
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
carried out in the case of neonatal
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
circumcision right so the the issue here
 
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
is that what we actually have is that
 
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
parents can provide proxy consent right
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
so in my research in hospital settings
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
on circumcision in all cases verbal and
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
written proxy consent which again is
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
incorrectly referred to as informed
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
consent was wholly inadequate and did
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
not fully include a comprehensive list
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
of all the important long-term side
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
effects and risks of the procedure in
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
fact I was truly taken AB by the number
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
of parents I talked to who told me that
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
they not only wish they had more
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
information about circumcision before
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
they agreed to it but that one was
 
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier but that it was
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier on in a person's
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy so that they would have had
 
00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
adequate time to consider the complexity
 
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:46.839 align:start position:0%
and permanence of the decision on behalf
 
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
of their neonate which frankly we
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have that choice to begin with
 
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:52.559 align:start position:0%
it is not our choice we are not giving
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
informed consent we are giving proxy
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
consent which we cannot give technically
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
in a cosmetic procedure so when we talk
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
about sort of like well what about this
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
um situation what about that situation
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
those are wholly different they're
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
totally different procedures one is
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
where you're an adult making a choice
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
for yourself and the other is where
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
you're an adult making a choice on
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of a child that's not medically
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
necessary and if you could wrap up I'm
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
sure we'll have some more questions for
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
you okay uh I will just say in my own
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
experience with child birth in 2012
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
although my Healthcare Providers knew
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
that I would be having a boy I was not
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
given any information or even asked
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
about it until 5 minutes after my son
 
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
was already born I was literally being
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
put back together together after what
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
felt like the most physically grueling
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
experience of my life while I already
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
knew based on my previous academic
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
research what my decision would be I
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
could believe there was no discussion at
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
all about it beforehand the entire time
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
that I was pregnant um and that I
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
received no prior consent forms to view
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
upon viewing information about
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
circumcision a few hours later I was
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
still shocked by the blatant
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
misinformation and lack of any detail on
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
what the procedure actually entailed or
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
would have been in store for myself
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
Son thank you very much for that
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
testimony uh representative
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair I also
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh voice my um lightness and
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
tardiness to this committee this morning
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately had a situation at home I
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
had to take care of so I was late to the
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee so I want to let you know why
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
I was
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
late if I
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
may I understand the issue of what
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying about informed consent and
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
parents' rights but where do we draw the
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
line because we always talk about
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
parents having the rights on behalf of
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
their children is this not a situation
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
here where the parents by Def fact still
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
have the legal right to make decisions
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
for the children because that's one of
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
the things we've been talking about is
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
the rights of parents and the state
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
should not be infringing upon those
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
rights so can you speak that please yeah
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
sure um I guess I would just counter
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
argue uh that can't argue that question
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
which is what other um procedure do
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to take
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
a part of their own child's body off of
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
them I I don't know an
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
appendectomy uh that would be done for a
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
a a medical
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
reason thanks follow okay representative
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
sorry um I have a question for you um I
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
know that some other practices um post
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
child birth offering formula and other
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
choices have um sort of had a paradigm
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
shift where instead of saying would you
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
like formula there is a wait for the
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
parent to request it do you think that a
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
shift in policy to meeting a parent's
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
request for circumcision as opposed to a
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
default assumption that all children
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
will want to be circumcised would have a
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
more appropriate conversation on those
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
desires given that there's no medical
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
reason that it needs to be done
 
00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
immediately yeah I certainly think that
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
that the Paradigm Shift has to occur and
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
that the Assumption should not be um
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
that the default should not be at all um
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
that this is what parents want um and I
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
think it honestly puts medical providers
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
in a very tough situation um where
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
they're forced to kind of you know I
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
think many medical providers aren't
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
really interested in this um but but
 
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
parents are asking for it um and they're
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
also asking for information and it's
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
such a touchy subject that that there's
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
just not a lot of communication going on
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
um but I would also argue that again
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
something like formula is is and I'm not
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting it you know um it's
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
just not an equal comparison at all in
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form we talked vaccines
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
not in equal comparison earpiercing not
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
an equal comparison and so I truly mean
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
when we talk about this is the only
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
procedure in which someone's body part
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
that is important is permanently removed
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
it it stands alone it really does it's
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
tough to
 
00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
compare thank you representative kushman
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you had said that
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
there were about 1 in
 
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.230 align:start position:0%
there were about 1 in
16,000

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
16,000
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
um uh medically necessary circumcisions
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
in adults um do you know what the rates
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
are for um dealing with complications of
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
circumcision um the best estimates that
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
we probably have and I certainly I've
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
seen these actually in some on some
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
consent forms are anywhere between two
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
and 5% potentially more um and which I
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
didn't actually say um out loud but what
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
I believe is actually much more commonly
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
the case is that we get revisions done
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
because a circumcision is is done um and
 
00:49:33.549 --> 00:49:33.559 align:start position:0%
because we're moving we're removing very
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
small parts on a very small body um as a
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
a person is growing into their bodies uh
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
things change um so revisions might be
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
necessary um but what also equally is
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
going on is that when we talk about
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
circumcisions that are performed um
 
00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:53.559 align:start position:0%
after the the neonatal period we're
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
talking about often times issues that
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
occur from lack of knowledge and lack of
 
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
information on how an intact penis
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
actually works which is that the forkin
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
at Birth is fused to the head of the
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
penis so when I hear things like oh
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
somebody told me that I need to retract
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
to clean under it no you don't that's
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
actually causing um harm it's causing
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
damage it would be um the physiological
 
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
equivalent if you will of trying to
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
clean under your nail into the nail bed
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
you cannot do that because your nails
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
are fused um to your fingers right um so
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
that is what causes significant damage
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
and that is what leads to circumcisions
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
um in the you know in the post neonatal
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
period can I followup thank you um I was
 
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
actually asking and and you did touch on
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
it at the beginning about um revision
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
rates for circumcision and and
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
complications from that do you know um
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
what some of those potential
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
complications are following
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
circumcision um there is yeah yes there
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
is significant um research done on what
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
those complications are in the short
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
term um you know usually what we see are
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
things like adhesions um where the
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
forkin attempts to um heal itself and um
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh sort of connect back onto the head of
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
the penis um there are also other kinds
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
of issues dealing with um uh too much
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
skin that's removed um so skin that's
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
actually sliced off or removed from um
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
the head of the penis too um things that
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
have to do with uh uneven or Jagged
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of um forkin cuts um things like
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
things like that um you can also see
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
things like forkin Bridges um that could
 
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
occur um they're they're incredibly
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
graphic I I think you You' probably want
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
to search them thank
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions thank you
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
very much for bringing oh sorry
 
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy my apologies no no
 
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much J thank you for
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um are you aware of
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
how circumcision is Le listed in the CPT
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
codes uh for most medical
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
insurers um I think it depends on the uh
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
Insurance are you are you aware that
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
this listed as a cp2 code under cosmetic
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
surgery or as an elective
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
procedure um what I have seen in the
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
past is that they it's sort of listed
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
under its own category of of just
 
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
circumcision not not as even underneath
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
either one of those but I again those
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
codes change so I'm not quite sure just
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
to be clear so you're not aware of it
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
being listed as a cosmetic procedure um
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
for insurance purposes no but it should
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
you um thank you very much and uh
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's somebody who knows uh
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
knows coding who can get into those
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
answers thank you very much for your
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
testimony um and representative
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
santonastaso I apologize that I did not
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
see you listed as a representative when
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
I was handling the C so it was not an
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
intentional oversight since we
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
first thank you uh good morning Health
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
Human Services and elies Affairs
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
committee I'm representative Santa naso
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of ringe Jaffrey
 
00:53:14.829 --> 00:53:14.839 align:start position:0%
and Dublin I'm in support of House Bill
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
1706 this bill provides notice to
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
parents prior to circumcision of an
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
infant as you all know by now um in the
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
bill Roman numeral 10d says your son may
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
want an intact penis and a decision to
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
have a circumcision denies him his
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
bodily integrity and autonomy which he
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
may resent when he
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
matures my relationship with my mother
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
suffers today and this is in part
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
because I resent the circumcision that I
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
received as an infant um I do believe
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
she was just going through the motions
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
we I'm not from a religious family
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's no reason that she would have
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
had the circumcision except that that's
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
just what you do um if she was informed
 
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
she might have made a better decision
 
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
and uh it could be possible that our
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
relationship wouldn't have this
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
contention point that it has today an
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
adult can always undergo a circumcision
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
later if he so desires um for for 10 C
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh circumcision is associated with
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 47 known complications
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
including heavy bleeding infection
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
disinf scarring uh mental sceris uh skin
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh the long-term impact of newborn
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
never been followed is only being
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
explored and publicized in response to
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
increasing complaints from circumcision
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
suffers and those pursuing Force skin
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
restoration uh my own circumcision was
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
botched and mine like most other people
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
I believe wasn't counting the stats
 
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't until I was 17 years
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
old old at actually at a physical where
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
someone had the courage to mention to me
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
that uh there's surgery available to
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
correct this sort of thing um before
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
that nobody would even dare talk about
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
such a thing even though uh it must my
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
parents must have uh been aware of it uh
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
because it's it's obvious uh all
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
circumcisions where the person doesn't
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
desire it is a botch circumcision uh one
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
of the outcomes of a botch circumcision
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
is death uh so it's important for
 
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
parents to be aware that this procedure
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
may actually kill baby um it may be
 
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
directly from hemorrhaging or indirectly
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh like in the uh known very known case
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
of Bruce rier who at 8 months old had a
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
botch circumcision so bad that it led to
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
the result of him losing his penis the
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
parents under guidance of a psychologist
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
attempted to raise the Bruce as a girl
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
and this ultimately failed as Bruce took
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
his own life at the age of 38 um
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
circumcision for convenience and
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
hygienic reasons is not necessary even
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
if it was true that circumcision is more
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
hygienic it would be similar to
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
believing that if we remove a baby's
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
arms it would be easier to put his shirt
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
on it off uh because you know it's
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
really hard to put their shirt on they
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
like move their arms a lot um removing
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
body parts to make it easier to keep a
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
baby clean is inappropriate all three of
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh my boys are uncircumcised and we have
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
a three-year-old and two 7-month old uh
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
twin babies um and there's zero
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
additional tasks that we perform to to
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
take care of him uh so in the United
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
States on the very first day of a baby
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
boy's life uh in these moments when a
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
newborn should be experiencing the Gent
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
care and bonding with his mother he is
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
instead subjected to an act that can
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
only be described as a brutal assault
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
this procedure introduces the innocent
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
newborn to experiences of pain and
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
Trauma it makes it so that at one time
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
in that person's life the only thing he
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
understood was brutality it's a
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
perfectly crafted evil a practice that
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
embodies the very essence of Injustice
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
and violence against the most innocent
 
00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll will take questions
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
if necessary thank you very much are
 
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
representative kushman thank you madam
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
chair do you know what the um the risk
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
of death is following circumcision the
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
statistical risk uh well we can't even
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
understand the psychological damage so
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
for people taking their own life and
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
things like this uh we don't know uh but
 
00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:21.799 align:start position:0%
I know that death from hemorrhaging and
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
stuff like this is one of the more it's
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh more rare than the other uh
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
conditions representative Merchant thank
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you taking the
 
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
question do you support parents rights
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh sorry do I support what do you
 
00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:43.039 align:start position:0%
support parental rights uh of course um
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
but this is making a decision on behalf
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
of someone else that is UN irreversible
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary thank you representative
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
Conway and uh three minutes I'll make
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
sure my timer is close to the microphone
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
point Madam chairman members of the
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for letting me
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
testify today uh my name is Dr David
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
Conway I
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
can is that better okay I'm a retired uh
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
board certified OBGYN I practiced for
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
about 33 years about 16 years here in
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
conquer uh at the uh residency over at
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
conquer hospital where I in fact trained
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
residents how to do circumcisions I've
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
done probably 500 to a th000
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
circumcisions I never really kept track
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
of those numbers I kept track of the
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
number of kids I delivered which is
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
about 2500 so half of those were boys
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
and half girls pretty much um I'm here
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
to testify in opposition to this bill
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
um the it's an incredible intrusion in
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
the practice of
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
medicine dictating the specific
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
information on the informed consent
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
requiring submission of that form for
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
approval requiring parents or patients
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
to inspect the surgical instruments and
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
that parents be shown a restraining
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
board I can think of no other surgical
 
00:59:21.029 --> 00:59:21.039 align:start position:0%
procedure that re requires that degree
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
of legislative intrusion which is no
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
news to since you've heard testimony to
 
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:27.799 align:start position:0%
that fact already uh I'm not going to
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
read the whole uh statement I um
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
um I certainly agree that it is not a
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
medically indicated um procedure it's an
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
elective procedure there are a variety
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
of elective procedures that don't get
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
this kind of scrutiny uh one that I'm
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
particularly familiar with is tubal
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
liation um during prenatal care one of
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
my my jobs as the provider was to talk
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
about circumcision and also about tub
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
liation not so much to liation as
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
contraception after delivery um whether
 
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
that those are recommendations from the
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
American College of OBGYN and that was
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
certainly part of my practice and part
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
of my uh job as training residents um
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's a painful procedure when I was a
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
resident in the late 1980s local
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
anesthesia was not used and kids scream
 
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch and I thought it was
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
barbaric and I chose I don't know if
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with the type of
 
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:35.559 align:start position:0%
instruments that are used um to do
 
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
circumcisions there's um a Mogan clamp
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
that is kind of like a uh a pincer that
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
kind of uh clamps across the the
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
foreskin there's a gamco clamp there's a
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
plastibell and there advantages to both
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
I used a in in residency I used the the
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
Mogan uh because it was quick and it got
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
got it over with as quickly as possible
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
for the infant uh because it was very
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
um I don't have anything really more to
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
add to my statement I will certainly
 
01:01:09.359 --> 01:01:11.710 align:start position:0%
add to my statement I will certainly
take

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative kushman and
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
then representative Shapiro thank you
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for being here
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
testify um so
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
we are you do you understand that the
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine and lure to
 
01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.039 align:start position:0%
practice medicine was created by the
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
legislature and therefore the
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
legislature creates the rules that one
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
agrees to operate under for that license
 
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
I am well aware of that I was a member
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
of the medical review subcommittee for
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
six years uh of the Board of Medicine um
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
I was uh a member of the Board of
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
Medicine itself for 7 years and
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
eventually president of the board so I'm
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
well aware of that thank you follow up
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes follow up um um understanding that
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
and I I just want to kind of um contrast
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
that or show that there's precedent
 
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
for us having a form and would you agree
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
that we have Protections in place for um
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
the human rights of subjects in medical
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
research and we have increased um
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
consent requirements for when that's
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
going to be done on children um are you
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
aware that we have consent forms for um
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
vaginal births after cesarians section
 
01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
and that that's in our statute also so
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
that this isn't creating a new um a new
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
idea or a new method of ensuring
 
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
protection for patients I'm not aware of
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
those specific requirements um informed
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
consent is Central to doing surgical
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
procedures or any kind of procedure and
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
it's something that's very clear clearly
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
taught during medical school and very
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
clearly taught during
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
residency representative shap and then
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you madam
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking this question
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard terms like um
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
cosmetic elective
 
01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:08.839 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um we've also heard from at
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
least one person about some of the
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
health benefits of
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
circumcision um but we've heard these
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
terms as if they were um one and not the
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
other and um isn't it true that there's
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
some overlap between elective surgery
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
and medically necessary surgery for
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
example um when I had terrible sciatica
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
problem I was given the option of a
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
medically necessary back surgery um it
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
was still elective I mean I chose not to
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
do it um
 
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
because you know I made the decision
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
based on my research so isn't there some
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
medically I don't maybe there's another
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
term s it's medically necessary but um
 
01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:00.039 align:start position:0%
medically legitimate and
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
elective hard question to answer because
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
i' I've sat in your shoes with exactly
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
that same decision and uh the outcomes
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
after this is not going to be news to
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
you but the outcomes after back
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
surgery don't Norm don't typically last
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
for a very long time and there's
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
certainly complications involved so I
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a great answer for
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
you r representative Weber and then
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
representative poos
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
off thank you madam chair and I my
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
apologies I had to step out for
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
another trying to be in two places at
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
the same time so you may not be the
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate person to ask this question
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
and if it's not your field uh just feel
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
free not to answer I was just wondering
 
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
I know that certain other states have
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
regulations in this space do you know if
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
there are other states that have adopted
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
this particular bill in its compl
 
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
complete form as it has been presented
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
to us because from what I heard from
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
many people prior to this meeting it
 
01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
sounds like this is a a form that and a
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
movement that is National in scope so I
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
wondered if it has been adopted in its
 
01:05:12.589 --> 01:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
entirety elsewhere I don't know I I've
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
been retired for about seven years uh is
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
that something that could be going
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
around it could be but I have no
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
knowledge of it I'll hold it for later
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I think it's a little bit over
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
the top uh representative p then a
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and then na
 
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chair and thank you for
 
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if we modify this
 
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
bill in in your opinion what's the best
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
procedure or what's the best time to
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
discuss this issue with a parent uh we
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
heard testimonies that sometimes it's
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
discussed uh minutes after delivering uh
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
so that's probably not the best uh peace
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
of mind for mother to make decision so
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
when when it should be discussed with Ma
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
and like in what form like should it be
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
like some additional opportunities to
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
opt out or opt in uh could you uh give
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
your thoughts I don't think it's a
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
specific time it's uh recommended
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
sometime during the prenatal period
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
during prenatal care um one one topic
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
that comes up is contraception
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
specifically around tubal liation and
 
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid patients there's a
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that that could be performed
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
Med and the consent be signed 30 days
 
01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
prior to delivery so somewhere
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
between uh seven months and eight months
 
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry five months and eight
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
months kind of a flip of the
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
coin I representative
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking a question Dr Conway uh
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
first of all congratulations on your
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
retirement in regards to the incent form
 
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
form of
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
consent as a practice physician who's
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
delivered to 2 200 people into this
 
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
world was that something was a verbal
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
consent was it written consent um
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
because it really kind of elected
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
procedure surgical can you comment on
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's more of a verbal consent or
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
was this a written consent any kind of
 
01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
invasive procedure has got to be a
 
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
written consent written consent so in
 
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.190 align:start position:0%
written consent written consent so in
saying

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
that where do you stand on an a formed
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
consent it sounds like we already have
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
one because it's a surgical
 
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
procedure the question I think I'm
 
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
wrestling with is how does prescriptive
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
that form has to be dictated by the
 
01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
state I don't have a good answer for you
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
um if I listed every single possible
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
complication for every single procedure
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
that I was trained to
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
do I would spend hours which I talked to
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
I've talked to patients about what are
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
the most common things that happen
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
certainly with uh circumcision there's a
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
risk of bleeding that's kind of is a
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
no-brainer um there's a risk of I'm not
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
sure if you really understand what
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
happens with a circumcision that any of
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
the instruments really
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
crush the um foreskin and uh the extra
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
foreskin that is uh being taken off is
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
then ex sized above that Crush line uh
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's the the Mogan clamp that
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
kind of comes together like this or
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's the um gamco which comes in
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
three different sizes which really gives
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
people the best control over uh how much
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
force skin to take off um one of the
 
01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
possibilities is that that Crush line
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
can separate so the foreskin then kind
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
of slides up the the shaft of the penis
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
question you um representative Nagel and
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:55.269 align:start position:0%
then representative
shapir

01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
shapir
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um Madam shair thanks for
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question I had two different
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions I decided to go with a
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
different one because you answered mine
 
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
um I've been a doctor for 40 years it's
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
actually my 40th anniversary of my first
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
circumcision that I did so um it's
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
ironic that we're here today to
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
celebrate that event but
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that's really hard
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
about becoming a young doctor and you as
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
a teacher would know this is learning
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
how how to inflict pain because it's
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
part of the job
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
MH Am I Wrong um is it unusual for us to
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
ever inflict pain on a patient when we
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
do a procedure of any
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
kind if somebody is under general
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
anesthesia then there's really you would
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
be inflicting pain if they were not
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
having general anesthesia right so um
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
you inflict pain when you inject local
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
anesthetic um having had several
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
Misadventures with um kitchen knives um
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
and visits to the the emergency room
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
local anesthetic hurts like hell um and
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of local anesthetics that's
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
injected for doing a dorsal P block is
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
four 3 to four1 of a CC on each side of
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
the uh dorsal penis at the the base of
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
it um so uh I will tell you that the
 
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
difference between doing a circumcision
 
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
without anesthesia compared to doing it
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
with the dorsal penar block
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
and um a kind of a sucrose Solution on a
 
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
pacifier is like night and day as far as
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
the experience of perceived pain of the
 
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.870 align:start position:0%
the experience of perceived pain of the
infant

01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
infant
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you uh representative
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you madam chair um if we
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
were to um am end up amending this bill
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
to create an a form consent form um that
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know listed pros and cons cons um or
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
if we amended it to create a br an
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
educational brochure to do the same
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
which I think people should be fully
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
educated who would be in your opinion
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
who would be
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the experts and maybe non-experts who
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
would come together to create a that
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
kind of form or that kind of brochure to
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
um to have you know people with
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
different ideas represented who would be
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
who would the experts who would be the
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
in best position to
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
create um that kind of informed consent
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
or bro education brochure um I don't
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
have a perfect answer I would include
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
people who do the circum do
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
circumcisions as an OBGYN it's something
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
I was trained to do it's something I did
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
throughout my career um pediatricians in
 
01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
different areas of the country where
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
I've practiced um were more likely to do
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
circumcisions I never fought for them
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
they it's not something I go out of my
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
way to try and talk people into period
 
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
um Family Physicians those are the
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
people who are doing most of these
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
circumcisions um so certainly one of
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
those uh members of the public who have
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh some say in the matter uh nursing uh
 
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
I would I didn't put it in my statement
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
but I used to be a labor and delivery
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
nurse before I went to medical school um
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I've seen it from a couple of
 
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.270 align:start position:0%
so I've seen it from a couple of
different

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
sides thank you very much okay thank you
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
still have a representative mlan thank
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
my question um based on some of of the
 
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
prior testimony and your experience um
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
do you feel that uh the informed consent
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
that we have right now is adequate um
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know based on your experience and
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
and what they've testified to and do you
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
think that there might be some Merit you
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
know in non-emergency cases to maybe
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
altering the Paradigm a little bit to
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
frontload some of that consent so it's
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
not coming at the last minute or would
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
that not be practical that's an
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
excellent idea um that's certainly what
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
we do uh prior to doing a um tuation as
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
far as getting that consent signed um
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
and the conversation about contraceptive
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
options goes into that whole process so
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
I think that would be reasonable uh I
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
think having uh putting in every
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
possible complication uh is really over
 
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.750 align:start position:0%
possible complication uh is really over
the

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
top thank you
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
yep um seeing no further questions thank
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%

01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%

welfare I'm grateful that representative

Phillips brought this forward and we
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to discuss it and at
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
the very least raise awareness you see I
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
moved here as a teen from Hungary where
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
just like in the entire European
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
continent or most of the world in fact
 
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
circumcision is not performed
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
prophylactically for disease prevention
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
it didn't even cross my mind until after
 
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
the birth of my first son in 2005 after
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
an exhausting day of giving birth upon
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
leaving the hospital my husband warned
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
me to make sure his son does not get cut
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
or else something really bad is going to
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
happen to the doctor's
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
genitals I didn't understand why he
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
would be worried about this at all you
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
see in my in my mind circumcision was
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
strictly a religious ritual of a faith
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't belong to but lo and behold
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
when I was by myself recuperating from
 
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
giving birth and after a sleepless night
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
trying to nurse my newborn I was in fact
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
presented with a form where I needed to
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
check off if I wanted to have my son
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
circumcised there was nothing to explain
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
what that meant why it was an option it
 
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
was simply listed like one of the
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
choices on a restaurant menu
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
I was surprised but not wanting to hurt
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
either my babies nor the doctor's
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
genitals I checked no my son's polish
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
pediatrician did not try to pressure me
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
at all he's the one who came to the
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
hospital to check out the baby so we
 
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
were smooth sailing until the time I
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
inquired if there was anything special I
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
needed to do to keep my little boy clean
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
that was the time he demonstrated how I
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
needed to push back my baby's foreskin
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
to wash under it at bathtime to my
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
surprise my son started screaming and
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
once we got home I found a drop of blood
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
in his diaper and in the next few days I
 
01:16:02.669 --> 01:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
noticed a tiny scar on his
 
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
foreskin this is what prompted me to
 
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
start researching for myself sure enough
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
I found out that I was given the wrong
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
advice by my pediatrician I learned that
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
at Birth the foreskin is attached to the
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
head of the penis and the tip is like a
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
tight sphincter that keeps dirt out
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that needs to be done
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
besides rinsing it with water in fact it
 
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
was easier to keep clean than my girl's
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
private parts and definitely much easier
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
than caring for a circumcision wound R
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
for infection in a dirty diaper which we
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
know many parents don't even realize had
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
the hospital included a brochure about
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
intact care like they do about
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding umbilical cord care car
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
seat use which is regulated by the New
 
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Justice this
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
could have been avoided
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
even at my pedian office this type of
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
written instruction was lacking despite
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
an entire wall covered with brochures
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
the American Family Physicians website
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
has a list of postpartum discharge
 
01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
instruction that includes genital care
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be nice to print that for
 
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
parents on a website from 2006 it says
 
01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
parents should gently cleanse
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
uncircumcised genitals with warm water
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
the foreskin should never be forcibly
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
retracted because this makes cause fosis
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
well I can thank my intuition and
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
inquisitive mind that I did not cause my
 
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
child a true fosis but we can certainly
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
use a little help in ensuring that
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
proper information is provided to new
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
parents by those who are entrusted with
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
their children's care this is what I'm
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
hoping you will assist with in order to
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that doctors honor their
 
01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:47.239 align:start position:0%

pediatricians or doctor's office um or
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
even prenatal um training or uh
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
educational materials when I was taking
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
fatherhood classes they taught us you
 
01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
know don't shake a baby the no-brainer
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
stuff don't hurt your kid but they also
 
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
didn't teach us what really hurts our
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
kid they they missed one big
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
thing and it's something that I you know
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
I didn't know
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
about I didn't remember being
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
circumcised as a child and many of the
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
issues I had I just thought it was part
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
of puberty just part of growing up you
 
01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:46.030 align:start position:0%
of puberty just part of growing up you
know

01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
just and um but the worst part was what
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
happened to my
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
son I didn't think it was really all
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
that bad when it was happening he didn't
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
scream he just made kind of a little
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
whimper noise like you know you pinch a
 
01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:05.719 align:start position:0%
person a little too hard but it was a
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
week later when he started getting
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
infections after we were cleaning him as
 
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
we normally would we followed the
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
doctor's instructions to the tea we went
 
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
to and before that we went to every
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
class we went to every course we did
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
everything that we thought we were doing
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
was right and he still ended up with an
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
infection and a fever of 102° and we
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
nearly lost my son we had to take him to
 
01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.229 align:start position:0%
nearly lost my son we had to take him to
the

01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
ER I nearly lost my boy that
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
day and I I I I I'm terrible with names
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
here so I don't remember who it was who
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
said that they were a regret mom and
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
that they hope that their son can
 
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
forgive them one day as someone who's
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
going through that myself
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
something that absolutely breaks my
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
heart is I don't know what I'm going to
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
say to Michael
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
when when he's old enough to ask me hey
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
Dad what happened to my foreskin why'd
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
you put me through a procedure that can
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
kill people that gave me an
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
infection what happened to my
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
sensitivity down there maybe he has some
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
other issues that come about in life
 
01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
later that I don't know psychiatrically
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
physically I'm not a doctor I'm not a
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
medical professional I'm just a
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
concerned parent and a person who is
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
also you know grieving over my own body
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
now that I've as a foreskin restorer
 
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
over the last three
 
01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.350 align:start position:0%
over the last three
years

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
um I it really taught me a lot about
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
what I had lost and what I had taken
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
from my
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
son I I if someone had issued me a
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
brochure or any of the things that we've
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
been mentioning here some sort sort of
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
you know sheath of
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
papers maybe about this size with this
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
amount of information on it I would have
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
turned back and said no you're not
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
cutting my son I would have said no
 
01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
you're not going to risk my
 
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
son his life his well-being I wouldn't
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
let you and I wish and my ex-wife wishes
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%

01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
had the information available to us
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
I uh thank you that's been very powerful
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
thank you if there's anything else to
 
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
wrap up but that's been incredibly
 
01:22:32.669 --> 01:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
powerful thank you so much for sharing
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%

wonderful wonderful day were there any
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
questions furthermore I will say that in
 
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion an procedure such as this is
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
not only unnecessary it is frankly an
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
abomination against the ideas of freedom
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
and Justice that it be done with so
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
little information given to the parent
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
and uh that it is allowed to occur to
 
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
someone who is completely unable to even
 
01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:05.719 align:start position:0%
speak on their
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
behalf thank you thank you both both
 
01:23:11.229 --> 01:23:11.239 align:start position:0%

01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Hospital
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
Association uh Mr Bradley you've
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
indicated uh five minutes if you could
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
keep it to three we'd really appreciate
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
it yes of course I'm happy to do that Mr
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
chairman it's honor would be in front of
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
the committee for the first time in my
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
new role as the vice president of state
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
government relation for the New
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association we
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
represent all 26 hospitals in the state
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
including um our 15 birthing hospitals
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Hospital
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
Association I'll keep it brief uh is
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to HB
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
1706 uh and I'd just like to share a
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
quick concern uh that has been um
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned before but I'd like to
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
reiterate uh we believe informed consent
 
01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:17.719 align:start position:0%
is a critical process that ensures
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
patients or their representative
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
participate in the development of plan
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
their plan of care
 
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
however this bill puts into statute very
 
01:24:26.669 --> 01:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
specific language to be used for
 
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
informed consent of a circumcision
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
procedure we're not aware of any other
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
statute that prescribes this kind of
 
01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
specific language for informed consent
 
01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
or any other medical
 
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
procedure uh treatment or care uh by
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
doing so our concern as a legislature
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
would enact language that becomes
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
outdated or insufficient to keep up with
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
modern medicine I'll leave it with that
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll take your questions thank you
 
01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you and welcome to
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services looking forward to
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
getting to know you uh my question is
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
about the way that some of the policies
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
and hospitals have changed that some of
 
01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
the things that were just presumptive
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
before became an on request service and
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
my question which you may need to go
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
back and get answers for would be if the
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
hospital associations would be opposed
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
to moving to having circumcisions on
 
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
request as opposed to saying here's the
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
form yes or no because I remember even
 
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
though I was very aware of this the
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
forms that I had were did not have all
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
the information that I needed understood
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's something the
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislature should contemplate is
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
whether it would be appropriate to
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislate that kind of um consideration
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
for a for for what you just described um
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
as far as I know I think it would also
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
be important to bring together medical
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
experts to understand what would be most
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate um happy to work with you
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have a concrete answer
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh for your exact question um but that's
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
my respon
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%

Palmer thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%

brought up the can you get the
 
01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
brought up the can you get the
microphone

01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
closer I want to hear what you have to
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
say can I get taller no sorry um thank
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
brought up the concern I have which is
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
that the language in here is sort of the
 
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
consent form and I'm my question is
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
would the hospital Association support a
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
a bill that just said a consent form
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
will be created with um you
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
know a a group of experts and and
 
01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
know a a group of experts and and
concerned

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
citizens doing that so that it's that
 
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
now a document that could be changed
 
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
over time yeah I think I think I
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the consideration of allowing
 
01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
those mechanisms that may already exist
 
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
to support how to inform
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
informed the informed consent process
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
right um I will say that you know the
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
centers for Medicare and Medicaid
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
services does have uh guidelines and
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
standards rules requirements for
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
informed consent as does the Joint
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
Commission DMV uh with their
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
accreditation so um you know I can't
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
commit to uh you know something before
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
seeing it I'm happy to take a look but
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
our big concern is really just
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
legislating the specific language that
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
you see before you thank you sentive
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um as a followup
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
to the earlier discussion um and
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
with understanding of concern about
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
intruding ourselves into the practice of
 
01:27:43.149 --> 01:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
medicine I wonder if there would be a
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
willingness on the part of the hospital
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
Association in connection with medical
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
providers to undertake a rigorous
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
examination of both the informed consent
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
process and the
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
um question of whether this is something
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
that you you have a yes or no whether
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
you have to ask for it and say gee I'd
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
like to talk about this procedure as
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to having it in
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
legislation well and that's try what I
 
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
tried to allude to with representative
 
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
Palmer is to use the body that exist
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
today to help with informed discussion
 
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
with experts who can make determinations
 
01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
process followup
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
sure I guess my concern is trying to
 
01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that somewhere along the line
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
in this discussion there would be a real
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
um representation that that would happen
 
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
rather than that it ought to happen I I
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
think these are I can't speak for as a
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
medical profession
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
but what I would say is I think that the
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
expectations of an informed consent are
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
routinely reviewed on an ongoing basis
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
in a moment in time I think that would
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
be continually important this is an
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
important discussion for the committee's
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
consideration on the importance of
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
informed consent and um I'm not opposed
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
to to working with anybody on um on this
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
issue representative
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair
 
01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
could you speak too how long a form has
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
to be retained by a facility um if
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're a minor because in here it says
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
specifically 25 years if you're an
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
infant that probably makes a lot of
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
sense but if you're not if you turn it
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
into someone who does it at 10 or 11
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
year ages of year that's a long time so
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
is 25 years consistent with what
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals today have to do with consent
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
forms for
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
minors I do not know the answer to that
 
01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
question precisely um I will say in what
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
I've heard previous previously is
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
statute has recognized a 7-year hold um
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
of medical information seven
 
01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
years seven years from thank you Mr
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
chair sorry seven years from what time
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
is it seven years from age of maturity
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
or is it seven years from the time it's
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
done I don't have a I don't have an
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
answer for
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
speak and uh representative
 
01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:23.719 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm assuming that
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
your voice is gone because you were at
 
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
the Bills game with me I was not no okay
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
I would had more fun probably than where
 
01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.430 align:start position:0%
I would had more fun probably than where
I

01:30:32.430 --> 01:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
was um I I I really appreciate the
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
discussion here today especially about
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
informed consent because I agree that
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
it's a more Global problem that we
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
really seriously need to think about
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
more globally with that
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
said I do have concerns about this bill
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
that I wish you could answer for me and
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
I will reiterate what I said earlier
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
um there in 2010 when I assume the
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
number may be increased I don't know but
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
48.3 million Surgical and non-surgical
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
procedures that would have required an
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
informed consent of some sort this is
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
just one small element to that and do
 
01:31:09.149 --> 01:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
you as your organization see this bill
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
as a potential slippery slope that we're
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
going to start facing not just this but
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
another legislation next year another
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
next year another next year for back
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
pain obviously we should do it for back
 
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
pain too right um do you see that as
 
01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
potential problem with bills like this I
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
think that's a reasonable consideration
 
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
that the committee should think about
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
yes other
 
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Rob Barry
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
Services good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I will be brief
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
um so um we are just here to provide
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
information we don't have a position on
 
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
the bill uh but I did want to direct the
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
committee's attention to a couple things
 
01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
um on page two of the bill line
 
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
25 it gives the department the ability
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
to Institute disciplinary procedures for
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
violations of the section uh in talking
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
with our licensing certification unit
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
here at the department or at the
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
department um we're a little concerned
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
about how we could enforce that there is
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
some overlap with um with patient files
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to look into with
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
this kind of um this kind of issue but
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
it's not something we anticipate that
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
would be an easy enforcement mechanism
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
for the Department with that being said
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
to the extent that there's any uh
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
suspected misconduct on the part of a
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
medical provider we do refer those to
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
oplc so that would some be something we
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
could do uh but we just wanted to raise
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
that with the committee the last thing
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
is on page
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
four um line 20 this is the consent form
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
that we've been speaking about um
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
currently the bill reads as the
 
01:33:04.590 --> 01:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
department is the final Arbiter of what
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
these consent forms should look like and
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
how they should be presented um it's a
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
bit outside the scope of what the
 
01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
department does um we've heard some I've
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
heard some recommendations from um many
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
individuals around the table here uh
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
that this should be a an effort uh by
 
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
medical professionals members the
 
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
community things like that the
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
department would wholeheartedly support
 
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
that as it doesn't feel like it's
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
equipped to deal with um such a task and
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take any questions okay
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr Barry for taking the
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
question would you look at line all of
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
two my concern is that in here is a
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
monetary penalty for medical procedure
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
as medical
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
facilities uh can you comment the fact
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
that they're not the ones doing the
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
procedure but the healthcare provider
 
01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
why would the medical facility be
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
penalized well when we have licensing
 
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
rules that we put in place we do have
 
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to issue civil monetary
 
01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
penalties uh this may be something that
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
falls under that but to your point
 
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant this was
 
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
something when I was speaking with the
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh the bureau chief of Licensing
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
certification we were not really sure
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
how we could Institute proceedings based
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
on this section uh against the facility
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
we'd have to look into that but it's not
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
immediately clear how this would fit
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
into our ongoing uh licensing
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
scheme thank you other
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative kushman thank
 
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
my question um hopefully I can remember
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
what it was
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
now um oh would you find that
 
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
um you were saying that you don't want
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
the department or it's kind of tricky
 
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
for the Department to be the final
 
01:35:00.910 --> 01:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
Arbiter of what the form says um would
 
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
you agree that perhaps a better way
 
01:35:05.229 --> 01:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
would be to find a form that already
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
exists from an organization that um has
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
created one like the Midwifery um
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
consent form for vaginal births after
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
cesarian I mean that's a potential
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
option but I I think the more
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate or at least the Department's
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
perspective is the more appropriate
 
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
course of action is to
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
involve as many stakeholders who have
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the situation as possible
 
01:35:27.199 --> 01:35:28.270 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the situation as possible
thank

01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
you Al representative
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman I I see on
 
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
the back of the spill that there's no
 
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
Financial note um as of yet um but is it
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
safe to say that if the department
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
actually had to provide copies of such
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
forms at no cost to a variety of um
 
01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
groups that there would be some
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
significant cost potentially um with um
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
with printing when especially when
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
you're not able uh to charge the
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
receiving entity for it it can cost a
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
lot in uh ink toner um and in particular
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
staff time um you know I I deal with
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
right to no requests a lot um and they
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
can take a significant period of time to
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
um to get out there so um it's it's a
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of time to put the
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
stuff together sometimes thank
 
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:21.870 align:start position:0%
stuff together sometimes thank
you

01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:24.070 align:start position:0%
you
other

01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Richard
 
01:36:34.719 --> 01:36:36.109 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Richard
Arthur

01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
Arthur
 
01:36:49.229 --> 01:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
rights so you've indicated you want 10
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm afraid we can't give you
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
that much time um we said everybody to
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
keep it right around three minutes
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
please good uh also uh you've you've
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
filled out this card for both this bill
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
and the next bill we need separate cards
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
for each bill uh so if you could do a
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
separate card for HB 1683 I'd appreciate
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
that oh sure sure no problem the good
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
news is uh most of what I was going to
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
say has already been
 
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
addressed um but but um there are
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
certain things that I would like
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
to to uh to address uh for one thing one
 
01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
common theme that I'm here we've got
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
medical professionals who oppose the
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
bill we had a doctor we had well anyway
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
um the problem is that medical
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
professionals think they know more than
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
they do and uh Studies have been shown
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh I actually sent links to such studies
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
two of them um studying medical
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
textbooks in the US which uh do not
 
01:38:04.830 --> 01:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
adequately educate about the foreskin
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
and its
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
functions and uh surveying doctors and
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
finding out that they don't know
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
anything about what they're cutting off
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
so appealing to
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
doctors is is
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's not a good idea it's called a
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
argumentum vacunan or uh appeal to
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
Authority but when the authority are
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
mistra or uninformed themselves that
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
does nobody any
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
good this is not a medical issue it's a
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
human rights issue any and all argument
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
about the pros and cons or medical
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
benefits versus
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
not benefits it's all bunk when it comes
 
01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:57.159 align:start position:0%
down to bodily
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
autonomy uh which by the way is a
 
01:39:03.149 --> 01:39:03.159 align:start position:0%
concept not any particular
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
organization uh the first
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative buroughs uh cited
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
the AAP but the aap's statement which
 
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
was made in 2012 and which was heavily
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
criticized and torn apart by all the
 
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
medical organizations of the world
 
01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
basically uh expired uh several years
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
ago and is null and void and the
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
CDC they themselves refer to it so it's
 
01:39:32.639 --> 01:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
CDC they themselves refer to it so it's
all

01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
bunk there is no valid medical reason
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
for uh amputating baby boys for skins
 
01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:44.629 align:start position:0%
for uh amputating baby boys for skins
and

01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh as men who are who are uh victims of
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
this we do not appreciate it um there
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
are hundreds of thousands of men that we
 
01:39:59.550 --> 01:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
know of based on sales and inquiries and
 
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
so on that are undergoing forkin
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
restoration as for me I have to say this
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
because people have to know that um it's
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
not a good idea people have to know the
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
truth but I keep a an O-ring or other uh
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
device in place on my penis to hold
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
vestigal skin and scrotal tissue over
 
01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:28.550 align:start position:0%
vestigal skin and scrotal tissue over
the

01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
glands to keep it
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
protected the glands whether male or
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
female is an internal organ that is
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be covered and
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
protected if that ever slips off and I
 
01:40:42.159 --> 01:40:43.270 align:start position:0%
protected if that ever slips off and I
lose

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
lose
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
it then within a short time I start
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
feeling very uncomfortable as the glands
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
painfully rubs on my clothing just like
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
before I started the foreskin
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
restoration uh when I was 25 years old
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
and within a few hours my
 
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
meatus uh that is the uh urinary opening
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
burns with pain from being exposed and
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
rubbing on my clothing you could please
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
St please St wrapping up your testimony
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
one of the questions was the rate of
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
complications the answer is we don't
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
know because such complications are are
 
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
hidden it's a criminal operation and the
 
01:41:36.750 --> 01:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
truth would put circumcisers behind bars
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh and so of course the complications
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
are being hidden but meatal
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
stenosis that is hardening of the UR uh
 
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
the opening there the the meatus is
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
diagnosed in about 20% of cases I sent a
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
link to representative Phillips to to
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
back that up that that 20% diagnosed I
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
maintain that there's a 100% rate of
 
01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:05.719 align:start position:0%
meatal stenosis sir but it's only
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosed as such once it uh it starts
 
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
obstructing the urinary flow thank thank
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
you sir thank you I support the bills to
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
to defund circumcision from Medicaid it
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
is not a medical procedure it is a
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
medical fraud and to uh inform parents
 
01:42:31.589 --> 01:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
so uh so as to slow down their eagerness
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
to have it done to their children thank
 
01:42:36.189 --> 01:42:36.199 align:start position:0%

question um you had mentioned that
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
um you had alleged that it's a criminal
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
operation and I just kind of wanted to
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
explore that a little bit is there some
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
way of making money off of poor skin oh
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely oh absolutely look it up look
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
up um uh forkin uh regenerative uh cream
 
01:43:08.669 --> 01:43:08.679 align:start position:0%
there's facial cream that's being made
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
with foreskins that are basically taken
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
from hospitals uh you can look at up uh
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
Candace Williams uh Candace Owens excuse
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
me did quite an expose on that it's a
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
huge business that's not to mention
 
01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.669 align:start position:0%
huge business that's not to mention
foreskin

01:43:24.669 --> 01:43:24.679 align:start position:0%
foreskin
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
restoration um one study found that uh
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
well there's a potential for billions of
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
dollars if men had the money to do it
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
they would get their forkin back not
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
that it can be done
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
really other
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.709 --> 01:43:49.719 align:start position:0%
sir and again please don't forget that
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
card for the next bill
 
01:43:54.589 --> 01:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
um also signed up to speak and I hope I
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
close yes my name is yob abav um I was
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
born and raised uh Jewish Orthodox where
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
the practice of circumcision is
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
routinely done um with no anesthesia um
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
the baby gets a a tip of of uh a finger
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
is dipped in the wine that's made a
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
blessing and they put in the baby's
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
mouth and and there you go um it is not
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
a uh a joyful s at all
 
01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:37.639 align:start position:0%
um any anyway
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
um the circumcision comes you know as
 
01:44:44.189 --> 01:44:44.199 align:start position:0%
far as you go from the Bible when uh it
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
is done as part of a contract between
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
God and the Jewish people and uh it goes
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
from there even my Mones um thousand
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
years ago is a Jewish scholar a
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
philosopher and a and uh and
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
um and a doctor um wrote that it was
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
mainly done um for the benefit as it
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
would kept uh U men for from uh
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
masturbating and uh this is nothing but
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
a uh a
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
religious ritual that got carried on
 
01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
into the modern times where most people
 
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
around the world would not do it when it
 
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
comes to circumcising uh females
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's oh it's a big deal and um I
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
would uh it would be funny to see people
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh playing the parental rights card on
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
that one uh in this country um it only
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
works if when it's for uh
 
01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:43.430 align:start position:0%
works if when it's for uh
male

01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
um that's pretty much the gist of it but
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh at the very least if uh as long as
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's legal people should be afforded at
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
least a good acknowledgement to what the
 
01:45:57.790 --> 01:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
procedure is and what it is not thank
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
you uh any
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%

brother I was born over in Salem Mass
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
and I was a premature infant and had a
 
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
doctor who decided not to circumcise me
 
01:46:48.189 --> 01:46:48.199 align:start position:0%
because he thought it would kill me I
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
was premature and I am an attorney at

01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
have been studying this entire issue
 
01:47:05.119 --> 01:47:05.910 align:start position:0%
have been studying this entire issue
since

01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
1980 uh just before uh we had
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
children um since 1995 I've actually
 
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
been litigating circumcision issues I've
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
been admitted proac V in 28 States I've
 
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
lectured at Pace University uh lawol
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
school on this issue and at Jefferson
 
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
Medical College in Philadelphia and
 
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
several International symposia I have
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
handled about 72 genital injury cases
 
01:47:32.189 --> 01:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
arising out of circumcision including
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
such things as shaft stripping buried
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
penis part of the glands being cut off
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
or rotting off uh forc forkin retraction
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
and other uh injuries I have handled
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
over about 22 wrongful circumcision
 
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
cases where a parent where a child was
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
circumcised without permission I've
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
handled about handled or advised on
 
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
about seven cases where parents were
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
arguing over
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
circumcision um I will go into this more
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
with the other bill but there are a lot
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
of risks and the risks are really
 
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
unknown the last statement the American
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics the folks on that
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee admitted that they didn't know
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
the risks even though they were willing
 
01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
to say the benefits they thought
 
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
outweighed the risk but they really
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
didn't know the risk submitted to the
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
committee is has been um a uh uh a a
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
pamphlet that cites an 11 or a a study
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
that was uh put on at the society for
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Urology that showed an 11.5%
 
01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
complication rate uh I believe it is
 
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
greater than that 20% of the average
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
pediatric urologist time is spent
 
01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:39.750 align:start position:0%
pediatric urologist time is spent
repairing

01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
repairing
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
circumcisions uh I think probably 30% of
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
men who've been circumcised have had too
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
much shaft skin removed um what I do
 
01:48:50.189 --> 01:48:50.199 align:start position:0%
want to say is this is not a Rel
 
01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
religious issue none of the bills that
 
01:48:54.189 --> 01:48:54.199 align:start position:0%
neither of the bills that you'll
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
consider today have anything to do with
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh religion uh my family is somewhat
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
unique one of my brothers-in-law is
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
Jewish uh and his sons are Jewish
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
although I don't know if they practiced
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh one of my nieces uh has is a uh PhD
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
in Arabic studies Married An Egyptian
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
and converted to Islam I do not see the
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
bill of informed consent for a medical
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
place having anything to do with
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
religious circumcision and certainly
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit it or even require
 
01:49:25.149 --> 01:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
that parents in religious ceremonies be
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh informed of these things although
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
I must say that even there having
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
represented about five Jewish children
 
01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh who suffered serious injuries uh that
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
it would not be a bad idea but that
 
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
certainly isn't What U is required if
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
you could please stop wrapping up let me
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
say this circumcision is unique okay it
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
is the only so-called medical procedure
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
that removes a normal body part from a
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
normal infant that is why the consent
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
form needs to be there it is also the
 
01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
only surgical procedure that is
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
solicited unrequired surgical procedure
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
that is solicited doctors ethically are
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
not supposed to solicit medical
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
procedures and yet they do on a daily
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
basis in fact when my first son was born
 
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
the first thing that happened after he
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
was born as a nurses waving consent for
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
him going do you want to have him
 
01:50:18.510 --> 01:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
circumcised that is why the
 
01:50:20.669 --> 01:50:20.679 align:start position:0%
non-solicitation part of this statute is
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
so important uh I realized I I should
 
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
say this I have brought a book here I've
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
passed out some things on the function
 
01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
of the foreskin as well as other things
 
01:50:32.109 --> 01:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
you can look at I do want to say one
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
thing doctors will say and Dr Nagel I I
 
01:50:37.229 --> 01:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate you very much and the other
 
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
doctors on the committee doctors
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
honestly are not informed by the things
 
01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:42.679 align:start position:0%
I'm handing out which are what I handed
 
01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
out at Jefferson Medical College to the
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
students when I lectured there they
 
01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
would be the worst persons in my opinion
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
to be on a committee
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is unfortunately a very political
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
and as you can tell from the testimony
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
here to a highly um emotional topic I
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
think though if you look at it seriously
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
sir why don't we see if there's any
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
questions at this point are there any
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative kushman thank
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I you had mentioned
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
that you are an attorney and uh I just
 
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify something um just for
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
the record um it's according to the
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
lawyer code of professional
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility whenever a lawyer seeks
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
legislative administrative changes he
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
should identify the capacity in which he
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
appears whether on behalf of himself a
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
client or the public and so are you
 
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:32.360 align:start position:0%

or the public today I I I'm here just as
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
an individual acting on behalf of myself
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
in an issue that I think is important
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
and no no one has uh uh I'm not
 
01:51:43.149 --> 01:51:43.159 align:start position:0%

01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
organization whatsoever thank you
 
01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:48.109 align:start position:0%
organization whatsoever thank you
representative

01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned uh
 
01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
parents arguing about circumcision so is
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
father have any say uh in whether this
 
01:52:04.669 --> 01:52:04.679 align:start position:0%
procedure will be done and like in your
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
opinion is there any change needed in
 
01:52:08.079 --> 01:52:08.950 align:start position:0%
opinion is there any change needed in
this

01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
situation when parents don't agree well
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
I do I do believe this our law allows
 
01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:17.719 align:start position:0%
parents to make this decision one can
 
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
argue whether or not it ought to do I
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
think two parents uh if both are
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
involved as this statute requires should
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
have to agree on it absolutely I have I
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
have seen spite circumcisions I have
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
seen people fighting over this uh I have
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
seen uh instances where parents uh you
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
know the parent the boy won't be
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
circumcised and then a parent later
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
marries somebody who wants the boy
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
circumcised and they have custody we
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
fought over that in Chicago uh yes I
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
think it's absolutely essential that
 
01:52:48.189 --> 01:52:48.199 align:start position:0%
both parents have to consent not just
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
one parent not just the mom who is was
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
under anesthesia uh and may not even
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
know what she's signing I represented a
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
a boy uh who when he turned 18 wanted to
 
01:52:58.990 --> 01:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
sue his circumciser we found out that
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
the mother really didn't even know she'd
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
signed a consent form she had just been
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
given demoral a few hours before and she
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
said she didn't even want her son
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
circumcised so yes I think both parents
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely should have to consent thank
 
01:53:14.069 --> 01:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
you representative wber then
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you I I
 
01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
may finally have found the more
 
01:53:20.069 --> 01:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate person to ask my question um
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
do you know uh if this uh legislation
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
which appears to me to be sort of
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
national in its submission has been
 
01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
adopted unchanged in any other states uh
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
I I do not know I do not believe it has
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
been okay thank you okay I this isn't
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
like uh the American legislative
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
exchange Council who's sitting around uh
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
lobbying uh legislatures okay I I in
 
01:53:48.189 --> 01:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
fact I didn't even know about the
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
existence of this bill until somebody
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
alerted me to it about two weeks ago and
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
asked if I and representative Phillips
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
asked if I would come up and offer my
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question following up
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
on the question from representative
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
kushman I understand you're not here
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
representing anyone except
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
yourself again for full disclosure and
 
01:54:15.149 --> 01:54:15.159 align:start position:0%
transparency are you here on your own
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
dime um I
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
I years ago okay when I was asked to do
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
a case in Chicago uh where parents had
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
agreed not to circumcise the boy they
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
were both from Europe the mother then uh
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
divorced uh married a circumcised man
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
who had a circumcised son who wanted to
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
push the circumcision on the boy uh a
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
number of people donated money uh
 
01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
essentially for my travel expenses I
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
think I don't think I charged any fee in
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
that case I thought it was important
 
01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
enough to do it pro bono but I had to
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
pay a co-counsel and and I had to have
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
travel expenses uh and as a result of
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
that an amount of money has remained in
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
my trust account that we did not expend
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that is I'm using that to be here
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
today if that weren't available either
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
friends would donate it or I'd be here
 
01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
on my own
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
dime representative Shapero thank you Mr
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um you just spoke um about both
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
parents consenting yes sir and I'm
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
wondering um I know you're not a
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
physician you're but you are lawyer so I
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
wonder if that is like significantly
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
different than any other kind of medical
 
01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
consent um where my understanding at
 
01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
least as a parent and as a mental health
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
professional that um it takes a parent
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
you know in good standing a parent who
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
actually has guardianship to consent to
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
medical treatment um and that um you
 
01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
know people wouldn't typically be asked
 
01:55:48.589 --> 01:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
to have if a mother takes their child
 
01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
for for treatment to have the father
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
come in also to give their consent so
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
would this be a departure from the norm
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
yes it would but I think it's an
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
important one and I'll give you an
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
example I was involved in advising in a
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
case in Missouri where the child had not
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
been circumcised the dad had always
 
01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
wanted it done and actually managed to
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
get custody of the child took the child
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
and had it done while he had custody and
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
had the doctor call and laugh at the
 
01:56:17.709 --> 01:56:17.719 align:start position:0%
mother so do I think both parents should
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
have to consent absolutely I'm very
 
01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:23.719 align:start position:0%
passionate about that I I think it it
 
01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
it's not fair to the child remember this
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
is unique this is the removal of a
 
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
normal body part on a child who cannot
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
consent proxy consent for for non for
 
01:56:35.709 --> 01:56:35.719 align:start position:0%
reasons everyone agrees is not medically
 
01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
necessary under the ama's there the AAP
 
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the American Academy of
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics own guidelines that is
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
unethical all right but we allow it but
 
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
if we're going to allow it certainly
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
both parents should have to consent it
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
should never be done over the objection
 
01:56:55.629 --> 01:56:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.069 --> 01:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
um I don't think in whatever we do with
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
this bill um I don't think we're going
 
01:57:02.910 --> 01:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
to solve the problem of contentious
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
divorces or contentious parenting so I I
 
01:57:08.069 --> 01:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't use this personally I
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to use this as an
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try to solve that problem
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
oh oh I I'm certainly not think having
 
01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
done an amount of divorce work I've done
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
a wide variety of cases in my time not
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
just the cases uh I agree we aren't
 
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
going to end that contention but it can
 
01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
requiring both parents to agree would
 
01:57:29.229 --> 01:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
end the bickering about it in many
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
respects because it would just be the
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
law and parents would have to respect
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
that and you would not have the coercion
 
01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
that often happens there was a terrible
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
case down in Florida where a uh couple
 
01:57:43.069 --> 01:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
had agreed the mother had agreed at when
 
01:57:45.069 --> 01:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
the kid was one to have him circumcised
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
the parents never were married uh she
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
had custody eventually he got custody
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
one of the doctors testified well I I
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
would do it but it's really not
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
necessary on a four-year-old okay and
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
the mother ran with the child hid out
 
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
got arrested and literally was forced to
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
get out of jail to sign a consent form
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
in Chains It's theonomous case and you
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
can look it up on YouTube it's
 
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's one of the worst things
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
I've ever think I've ever seen filmed in
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
a courtroom here in this country if both
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
parents had had to agree this wouldn't
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
have happened thank you other questions
 
01:58:21.149 --> 01:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman it's not often we
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
have a knowledgeable attorney before us
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
so I w't take advantage of it um so bear
 
01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
with me in regards to this procedure if
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
I understand it
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
correctly have had the time for a child
 
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
basically at that point in time a parent
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
makes a decision and therefore causes a
 
01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
complication and therefore you're
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
basically saying the child has some
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
legal ramifications to the parent
 
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
and this is one of situations where the
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
parent makes a choice on behalf of a
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
child and therefore as an attorney
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
you're representing the child if you
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
will against the parent can you tell me
 
01:59:01.629 --> 01:59:01.639 align:start position:0%
how this different than a parent elects
 
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
not to have a child receive polio
 
01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine and subsequently becomes victim
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
of polio and how the parent at that
 
01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
point in time is now going to be subject
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
to ramifications of making that choice
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the parent Char I have
 
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
never represented a child against a
 
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
parent in which hesitate to do so uh
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
I've I've only
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
represented um I guess it was one young
 
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
man against a doctor who circumcised him
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh be because with the consent was
 
01:59:38.589 --> 01:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
invalid I would I do think that the
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
circumcision is quite different than
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination vaccination can actually and
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
I don't want to participate in this
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't particip I believe in
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines I understand there are people
 
01:59:50.669 --> 01:59:50.679 align:start position:0%
who do not they're out they're in front
 
01:59:53.310 --> 01:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
here this morning uh I respect that but
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
I think that vaccines have a I remember
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
I'm old enough I'm 73 years old I I
 
02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
remember Polio I have a couple of
 
02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
friends who still have metal braces okay
 
02:00:05.229 --> 02:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
I don't for one minute think that
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines don't work effectively are
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
there risks yes I'm allergic to
 
02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
polyethylene glycol when I had to get a
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine I had to discuss with my
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
physician is it worth the risk because
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
peeg is in the thing and we decided it
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
was luckily I didn't have a reaction to
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
it so I think vaccination is an entirely
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
different issue here you were removing
 
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
normal healthy tissue from a normal
 
02:00:29.709 --> 02:00:29.719 align:start position:0%
infant now this statute doesn't prohibit
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
that okay and I and I'm not here to
 
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
argue that it should be
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
prohibited I socially I might argue that
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
it should be but that's not what this
 
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
bill does this bill merely says parents
 
02:00:41.790 --> 02:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be told these risks I want
 
02:00:44.109 --> 02:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
you to know I have seen a dead baby who
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
bled out I'm representing a child right
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
now who came very close to dying and had
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
two units of blood from a normally
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
performed circumcision except they took
 
02:00:55.629 --> 02:00:55.639 align:start position:0%
off all the shaft skin on the ventral
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
side of the penis the wound open because
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
of pressure the doctor earlier said
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
something about wounds opening they only
 
02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
open if you've taken off too much skin
 
02:01:05.709 --> 02:01:05.719 align:start position:0%
the child starts to bleed the parents if
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
if they're lucky get to the hospital in
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
time and it's not just poor parents it's
 
02:01:12.189 --> 02:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
Rich parents too I had a pediatric
 
02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
urologist guy head of Pediatric Urology
 
02:01:17.229 --> 02:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
Georgetown told me they had a situation
 
02:01:18.669 --> 02:01:18.679 align:start position:0%
where very wealthy parents right next to
 
02:01:20.669 --> 02:01:20.679 align:start position:0%
the hospital Hospital uh had a wound
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
separation the child almost died I have
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
seen a child that I believe died from
 
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
circumcision from bleeding but I didn't
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
take the case because the autopsy was
 
02:01:31.629 --> 02:01:31.639 align:start position:0%
blown and the body was was uh cremated
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
so I couldn't take the case because I
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't prove negligence on the part of
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
the doctor I'll get to it this afternoon
 
02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
but one of the problems with Medicaid is
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
here in Atlanta is that what the doctors
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
are doing is because Medicaid takes a
 
02:01:44.109 --> 02:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
couple of days to be approved they
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
aren't doing the circumcisions of the
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
hospital they're running and doing them
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
the office and then believe we've gone
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
Way Beyond the scope of the question or
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
the bill and I know there are other
 
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
people waiting if it's related to
 
02:01:58.069 --> 02:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
another bill sir yeah I I'll take that
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
up this afternoon I'll sign up for
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel did you have a
 
02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
question or you kind of had your hand up
 
02:02:05.629 --> 02:02:05.639 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't sure okay do yes thank you
 
02:02:06.910 --> 02:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted to ask you a
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
question you you in the last can you
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
hear me sir you in the last um um um um
 
02:02:18.510 --> 02:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
what you call it witness both implied
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
that doctors really shouldn't be
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
considered the experts on this and I
 
02:02:23.709 --> 02:02:23.719 align:start position:0%
want to ask I want to delve into that a
 
02:02:26.069 --> 02:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more so I want to make it
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
clear I did my first circumcision 40
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
years ago I did my last circumcision 40
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
years ago it's not something I do and
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
it's not something I'm an expert on nor
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
what I even profess that but there are
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
people who are Dr Conway who was here
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
early uh pediatricians things like that
 
02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
are you implying that they're not
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be considered experts or
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
doctors in
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
general I think it depends upon the
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
doctor and depends upon what he has
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
studied for example I asked Dr Conway if
 
02:02:55.950 --> 02:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
he could name for me the five layers of
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
tissue in the forkin he could not I
 
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
asked him to take the the items that
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
I've just given to you he refused them
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
okay medical Campbell's Urology 10th
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
edition does has a diagram in it that
 
02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
does not correctly show the layers of
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
tissue in the foreskin there has been
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
such a prejudice against the foreskin
 
02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
which actually in this country arose as
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
a result of masturb anti-masturbation
 
02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
Hysteria just asking you your opinion
 
02:03:23.310 --> 02:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
well the reason I think that doctors are
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
it depends upon the doctor Dr vanau
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
whose uh articles I have cited has
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
studied the issue in detail I think he's
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
an expert but I don't think everybody is
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of those who claim to
 
02:03:35.709 --> 02:03:35.719 align:start position:0%
be experts really don't know what
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
they're talking about when you get an
 
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
AAP committee who says well the benefits
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
outweigh the risk but we don't know what
 
02:03:43.709 --> 02:03:43.719 align:start position:0%
the risks are when I can tell you what
 
02:03:45.629 --> 02:03:45.639 align:start position:0%
the risks are then I think there's a
 
02:03:47.069 --> 02:03:47.079 align:start position:0%
problem and that's that's thank you sir
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:02.189 --> 02:04:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
Brewster and again Mr Boer you've
 
02:04:05.790 --> 02:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
indicated five minutes please try to
 
02:04:08.350 --> 02:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
keep it to three I will thank you uh
 
02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your time today I
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh hello my name is Shane
 
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
Brewster I am a neighbor from the north
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
I am a mayor born and shortly thereafter
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
circumcised in Portland
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
um I a part of an Ever growing
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
discontentment among those circumcised
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
young uh those who have had this
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
procedure without medical necessity and
 
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
without being able to give their own
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
informed consent I do not speak for
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
everyone uh we all have different
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
relationships with our bodies but I am
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
not alone in wishing my body was left
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
intact I head up the main chapter of the
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
National Organization of restoring men
 
02:04:50.109 --> 02:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
Norm for short a network of men who
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
provide information and support to those
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about being circumcised are
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
considering for skin restoration or are
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
in the process of restoring their
 
02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
foreskins foreskin restoration is
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned in section 10 C of the bill um
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
to elaborate quickly as it's kind of a
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
niche subject uh forkin restoration is
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
the non-surgical regrowth of penile skin
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
via tension induced mitosis in other
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
words by tugging on the remaining tissue
 
02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
over time consistently usually with the
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
device someone can trick their body into
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
growing a functional fact simile of a
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
foreskin uh This Is Not A New Concept
 
02:05:28.510 --> 02:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a fad forkin restoration has
 
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
been traced back to Roman times when the
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
pondis judeus a weight typically of
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
bronze or copper was AIX to the penis
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
for men wishing to undo what was then a
 
02:05:40.549 --> 02:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
less extreme version of circumcision
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
compared to what we practice today um in
 
02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
modern times we are now following
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
similar principles to those used in
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
Antiquity but with devices made of nylon
 
02:05:51.549 --> 02:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
and silicone the materials have changed
 
02:05:53.549 --> 02:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
but the wish to undo a choice forced
 
02:05:55.229 --> 02:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
upon oneself
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
lingers uh the process of forkin
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
restoration can take months to decades
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh depending on an array of factors it
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
can be immensely beneficial both
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
physically and mentally but takes a
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
level of time and commitment that a lot
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
of men struggle with at top that there
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
are specialized tissues excised during
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
circumcision which cannot be regrown in
 
02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
this process forkin restoration is in no
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
way ideal but nods to Roosevelt with a
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
do what you can with what you've got
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
where you are kind of attitude uh I've
 
02:06:29.069 --> 02:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
helped a handful of men locally over the
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
years but as we are more trees than
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
people up in Maine I am also well
 
02:06:36.189 --> 02:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
connected on the internet uh the online
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
platform Reddit has a forkin restoration
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
Forum which alone has around 33,000
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
users currently roughly growing about a
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
thousand users a month I'm also a member
 
02:06:49.069 --> 02:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
of 15 square a United kingdom-based
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
organization formerly known as Norm UK
 
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
their website traffic is upwards of
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
60,000 visitors a year as I said I don't
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
speak for
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
everyone um but there are a fair amount
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
of folks around the world who like
 
02:07:04.109 --> 02:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
myself have been robbed of the chance to
 
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
experience life in an unaltered Natural
 
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
Body men who like me struggle with the
 
02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
physical and mental impacts of a
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
procedure they did not consent to where
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
a bill like this the circumcision
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
transparency act as it's called in place
 
02:07:21.069 --> 02:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
when I was born my life would be much
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
different from
 
02:07:25.390 --> 02:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
discuss please stop to wrap up your
 
02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
testimony we do U for family discussions
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
um I was circumcised with the prompting
 
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the Doctor Who delivered me um he
 
02:07:33.149 --> 02:07:33.159 align:start position:0%
offered a slew of proposed health
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
benefits that we know now are not
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
grounds for the preemptive removal of
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
healthy tissue um parents should be
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
fully educated about circumcision should
 
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
they ask and not be erroneously coerced
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
into a decision that has lifelong
 
02:07:49.149 --> 02:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
impacts for someone other than
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you thank you
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative Paz off thank
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
question uh about uh
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
restoration uh do you have any estimate
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of like financial burden on
 
02:08:10.669 --> 02:08:10.679 align:start position:0%
a person who tries to restore uh his
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
Forest skin and also is this process ass
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
associated with any known further
 
02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:19.270 align:start position:0%
associated with any known further
complications

02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
complications
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
okay um as far as
 
02:08:24.750 --> 02:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
financials um restoration can be as
 
02:08:26.430 --> 02:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
cheap as you want it to be or as
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
expensive as you want it to be so some
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
people can do it by manual means by only
 
02:08:33.069 --> 02:08:33.079 align:start position:0%
using their hands um some people use
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
medical tape and devices they make on
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
their own um other devices cost several
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a piece um and it just
 
02:08:42.189 --> 02:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
kind of depends those devices need kind
 
02:08:43.709 --> 02:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
of Maintenance over time and when we're
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
talking about someone who might be
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
restoring for 5 to 15 maybe 20 years
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
those things have to be updated and
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
changed with
 
02:08:53.790 --> 02:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
time uh pardon could you remind me the
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
other portion complications from
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
restoration uh some medical side effects
 
02:09:02.109 --> 02:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
um nothing that I can speak to of
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
specifically this is an issue which
 
02:09:07.589 --> 02:09:07.599 align:start position:0%
often isn't understood by doctors I've
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
brought it to all of my Physicians that
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to including my chiropractor
 
02:09:16.109 --> 02:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
for fun um all of them had no experience
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
in this and I was the first person to
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
bring it to them so um my apologies I do
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
not have any firm answers
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
there thank you other
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
02:09:27.199 --> 02:09:28.790 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
thank

02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you so much Mr chair and
 
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
honorable members for the record my name
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
is Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 10
 
02:09:50.589 --> 02:09:50.599 align:start position:0%
new market and new new Fields um I think
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
it sounds from what I've heard that
 
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much everyone is in agreement
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
that parents as you've heard multiple
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
testimony are not getting proper
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
education before this you may remember
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
me sitting before you um last year that
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
I am an advocate for patients being
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
informed um so it should be no surprise
 
02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
that I am here today I did want to point
 
02:10:15.629 --> 02:10:15.639 align:start position:0%
out a couple of
 
02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
things that haven't been mentioned and I
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to address a few things that I
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
heard so the first thing is that um some
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the opposition has come from women
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
and I've not to say that because they're
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
women but I personally am hurt by that
 
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
because as a woman there is a ban on
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
female circumcision in this country and
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
in our state that protected me as a
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
child as an infant right and yet we
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
don't have those Protections in place
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
for men now this does not ban
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
that procedure but I find it hard to
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
benefit from protection while we're not
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
protecting male
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
infants um on the hospital guidance I
 
02:11:03.870 --> 02:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to to point out an example of a
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
hospital guidance that I was given on
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
circumcision because I think it kind of
 
02:11:10.510 --> 02:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
tells the story it gives the care for
 
02:11:13.069 --> 02:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
both a circumcised penis and an intact
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
penis at the bottom of the care for the
 
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
intact penis Which is far more simple
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's simply just making sure it's rinsed
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
it says in all bold never forcibly pull
 
02:11:25.069 --> 02:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
the foreskin back because it could cause
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
pain bleeding or tears in the skin
 
02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
that's literally what you're doing when
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
you circumcise the infant so the care
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
guide is saying don't do the thing that
 
02:11:39.870 --> 02:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
um that so many people kind of do just
 
02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
culturally um on the issue of medical
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
necessity and the idea that for some
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
reason it's believed culturally believed
 
02:11:50.430 --> 02:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
to be medically necessary when in fact
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
80% of the world it is not considered
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
medically necessary if you ask the
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians Association in England or
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
France or Germany or Japan or any of
 
02:12:01.229 --> 02:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
these countries they will all tell you
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
across the board it is not medically
 
02:12:04.990 --> 02:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
necessary which is why 80% of men across
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
the C across the world excuse me are not
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
automatically circumcised but the idea
 
02:12:13.149 --> 02:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
that well there may be some one in
 
02:12:16.589 --> 02:12:16.599 align:start position:0%
16,000 people need to be uh circumcised
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
as an adult um
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
by comparison things that we don't
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
remove from infants like uh appendix
 
02:12:27.310 --> 02:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
appendices I should say and gallbladders
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
and winstom teeth while one in 16,000
 
02:12:32.669 --> 02:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
adults may need adult circumcision one
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
in 20 need anend appendectomy one in 10
 
02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
need gallbladder surgery and 85% of
 
02:12:41.709 --> 02:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
people need their wisdom teeth removed
 
02:12:43.629 --> 02:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
as adults we do not take those from
 
02:12:46.109 --> 02:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
infants so why would we do something
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
when only one in 16,000 people need it
 
02:12:52.549 --> 02:12:52.559 align:start position:0%
as an adult on the question of if you
 
02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
could please start wrapping up I will do
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
my best Mr chair I understand that this
 
02:12:59.910 --> 02:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
is um has been a long uh hearing on the
 
02:13:02.189 --> 02:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
question of the duress state of the uh
 
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
of the mother I do think that the
 
02:13:06.430 --> 02:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation for showing the tools
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
that are going to be used can help
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
because that is a state where they're
 
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
not able to process maybe things like
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
facts and figures but are able to see
 
02:13:15.709 --> 02:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
the tools and kind of emotionally
 
02:13:17.229 --> 02:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
process what they would be doing to
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
their child on the question of why did
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
it become like an 8-day thing in
 
02:13:23.549 --> 02:13:23.559 align:start position:0%
religion and an a same day thing
 
02:13:25.229 --> 02:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
culturally I think that speaks to the
 
02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
fact that this is a cultural thing um
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
PRI predominantly cultural thing for
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
some people a religious thing in our
 
02:13:33.310 --> 02:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
culture but it's just something we've
 
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
become accustom and used to and I think
 
02:13:38.189 --> 02:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
our job as legislators is to be willing
 
02:13:39.629 --> 02:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
to question what we're comfortable and
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
used to and weigh things logically
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
objectively on the basis of
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
merits um on the issue of parents rights
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
the thing is that parents we we have
 
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
laws we have laws it's not parents have
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
all rights we have laws protecting
 
02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
children from their parents Ming them um
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then finally the paradigm shift I do
 
02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
personally agree that an opin probably
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
would be more in line with um the the
 
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
facts of the matter being that it's not
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
medically necessary I am glad to hear
 
02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
the suggestion that this will go to
 
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I do agree that bill could
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh use amending to streamline and soften
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
the language uh to make it more
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
consistent with Hospital documentation
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
that currently exists um but we do have
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
Hospital documentation that's required
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be given to parents and other uh
 
02:14:34.589 --> 02:14:34.599 align:start position:0%
people other patients as well so uh
 
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
having said that I don't think I have
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
technical ability to answer a lot of
 
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
questions that you have had before you
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
already but I will happily answer
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
whatever questions you any
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
PM good morning and good morning and
 
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
again uh you've indicated five minutes
 
02:15:07.549 --> 02:15:07.559 align:start position:0%
as close to three as you can possibly be
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
we'd appreciate I'm going to set my
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
timer and try to stick to what I have
 
02:15:14.669 --> 02:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
not heard already here I am representing
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
for myself I'm a family practice
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
physician I came all the way from
 
02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
Vermont here to speak to you because
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
I've been worried and concerned about
 
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
these issues for the 40 years that I've
 
02:15:28.549 --> 02:15:28.559 align:start position:0%
watched medicine uh I've heard doctors
 
02:15:31.709 --> 02:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
speak I did circumcisions on my own
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
patients I also delivered my own
 
02:15:35.549 --> 02:15:35.559 align:start position:0%
patients because I was a family doctor
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
in the midwest in Ohio and in Cambridge
 
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the problem with all of
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
this is that it is a bipartisan issue
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
and right now you're not understanding
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
as I'm he hearing it that this is very
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
unique as the attorney said there's only
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
one other thing that looks like that and
 
02:15:56.549 --> 02:15:56.559 align:start position:0%
that's female genital mutilation yes I'm
 
02:15:59.790 --> 02:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
using very harsh language I did not say
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
cutting I did not say circumcision I
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
said female genital mutilation you've
 
02:16:07.149 --> 02:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
already heard that there's a double
 
02:16:09.390 --> 02:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
standard I want to say that I'm a mom
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
who got caught in this and I would love
 
02:16:14.189 --> 02:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
to have had the kind of informed consent
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about here despite
 
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
being a doctor despite having my son
 
02:16:22.189 --> 02:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
intact till the age of 11 my divorced
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
husband managed to take him in for a
 
02:16:27.149 --> 02:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
circumcision when I was out of town all
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
right so that's one reason you want to
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
have both parents I'll also say that
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
since I was in Massachusetts I helped
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
write the laws that said that only one
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
parent should consent to surgery and
 
02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
that was about abortion issues all right
 
02:16:43.150 --> 02:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
because often it was the father or the
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
uncle or the brother that was the
 
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
perpetrator so I was hoisted on my own
 
02:16:50.309 --> 02:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
patard I know that you do not have the
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
same attitude towards abortion that I
 
02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
have in Vermont but I want you to know
 
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
that there are two issues here one is
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
who's paying for this one is whether
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
anybody is a regret parent physician or
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
patient you've heard from the regret
 
02:17:07.709 --> 02:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
patients I'm a regret parent I'm also a
 
02:17:10.230 --> 02:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
regret physician I was different from
 
02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
what that other doctor did I did not
 
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
lean into it and try to do this fast I
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
tried to know what to do do that door
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
side penile block from the very
 
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
beginning what happens nurses were
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
telling the doctor telling the P ask for
 
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
Dr param your baby will sleep through
 
02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
the procedure if you have Dr parm okay
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
so I started saying okay this is
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
religious if you're Jewish go and get it
 
02:17:36.990 --> 02:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
done as a bris and in time I understand
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
that there's a political issue here this
 
02:17:42.509 --> 02:17:42.519 align:start position:0%
is not anti-semitic okay to be saying
 
02:17:44.190 --> 02:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
that this is not something that we want
 
02:17:46.110 --> 02:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
the state of Nash of uh New Hampshire to
 
02:17:48.669 --> 02:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
be covering all right and it's also
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
bipartisan because I know some
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
Republicans are like hahaha the the
 
02:17:54.309 --> 02:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
neoliberals are hoisted on their own
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
pitard because that other bill that
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to discuss later is going
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
to take away the coverage from Medicaid
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
patients right I don't think it should
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
be covered for any medical insurance not
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
in a newborn genital autonomy is a very
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
real issue and it it haunts people I
 
02:18:15.309 --> 02:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
took care of Somali women all right they
 
02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
resented what had happened to them all
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
right right it's not that different you
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
heard it's not that different and I will
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
wrap up it's not that different for the
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
men I say it three times a peaceful
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:39.070 --> 02:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
sorry my name is op Yi that's a Nigerian
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
name but I'm an African-American who's
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
been here since before
 
02:18:46.519 --> 02:18:48.110 align:start position:0%
been here since before
1860

02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
1860
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
now that was a question and I sat back
 
02:18:55.709 --> 02:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
down to answer the
 
02:19:01.709 --> 02:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.439 --> 02:19:21.549 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:19:21.549 --> 02:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.559 --> 02:19:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:19:25.469 --> 02:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
morning one day several years ago I
 
02:19:27.309 --> 02:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
found myself in a hospital spending time
 
02:19:28.990 --> 02:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
with a family member who had recently
 
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
given birth this was my first time in a
 
02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
Maternity Ward and I didn't quite know
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
what to
 
02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
expect suddenly someone entered the room
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
overpowered me restrained me and cut off
 
02:19:43.549 --> 02:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
part of my penis while I screamed in
 
02:19:46.349 --> 02:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
protest remarkably this happens in
 
02:19:48.509 --> 02:19:48.519 align:start position:0%
hospitals around the country every day
 
02:19:49.950 --> 02:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
perfectly healthy people are strapped
 
02:19:52.030 --> 02:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
down and have their genitals probed
 
02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
clamped sliced and partially amputated
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
while they are too vulnerable to resist
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
or fight back the hospitals obtain
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
consent not from the affected person but
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
from that person's
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
parents putting aside the fact that
 
02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
proxy consent in which a family member
 
02:20:08.830 --> 02:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
speaks on behalf of a person who is
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
temporarily unable to speak for himself
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
is not valid for the amputation of
 
02:20:15.630 --> 02:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
normal healthy body parts we are here
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
today to discuss the issue of informed
 
02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
consent are the parents on Whose legally
 
02:20:21.790 --> 02:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
dubious consent the hospitals rely to
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
avoid accountability being properly
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
informed about the trauma and harm of
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
this unnecessary body
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
modification in almost every case they
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
are not the head of the penis is an
 
02:20:32.830 --> 02:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
internal organ it should be warm and
 
02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
moist and protected like your eyeball or
 
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
your tongue in addition to serving this
 
02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
protective purpose the foreskin contains
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
muscle tissue blood vessels and
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
erogenous nerve endings similar to those
 
02:20:43.630 --> 02:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
found in the lips fingertips and
 
02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:44.710 align:start position:0%
found in the lips fingertips and
cliteral

02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
cliteral
 
02:20:47.710 --> 02:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
Hood the forkin also facilitates sexual
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
activity by gliding back and forth
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
across the head of the penis during
 
02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
intercourse sealing the lubrication
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
inside and reducing the likelihood of
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
painful dry
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
chafing these and many other functions
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
are documented throughout the medical
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
literature but until recently they were
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
absent from most Anatomy textbooks in
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
American Medical
 
02:21:07.349 --> 02:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
Schools the more one learns about
 
02:21:09.389 --> 02:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
foreskin the more disturbing it is that
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
this fascinating body part is being
 
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
destroyed by a medical industry that
 
02:21:14.230 --> 02:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
does not fully understand the damage it
 
02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:15.030 align:start position:0%
does not fully understand the damage it
is

02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
causing we live in a nation of with
 
02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
Wounded genitals many of whom allow that
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
injury to be passed to their sons
 
02:21:23.950 --> 02:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
without even realizing that anything is
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
wrong parents love their children and
 
02:21:28.110 --> 02:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
want what's best for them when they
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
learn the reality of this unnecessary
 
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
genital trauma they protect their
 
02:21:34.510 --> 02:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
children from it if my parents had known
 
02:21:35.790 --> 02:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
about the structure and function of the
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
human foreskin they would certainly
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
never have allowed such a barbaric thing
 
02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
to happen to
 
02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
me HB
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
1706 will result in a better educated
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
population fewer human rights violations
 
02:21:49.710 --> 02:21:49.720 align:start position:0%

02:23:30.670 --> 02:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
largest professional anti-circumcision
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
advocacy group in the country and I'm
 
02:23:35.309 --> 02:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
speaking here on behalf of the
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
organization and our approximately 375
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
supporters we represent in New
 
02:23:44.429 --> 02:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today as we've heard a mother
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
who gives birth to a son will be set
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
upon by doctors nurses and Hospital
 
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
staff who will encourage her to
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
circumcise her baby um some of the
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
things that mothers will be told is that
 
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's cleaner that it's healthier and
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
that everybody does it you've already
 
02:24:01.469 --> 02:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
heard about the condition of the mothers
 
02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
when they're approached and asked to
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
sign a consent form so I won't go over
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
that again but I know this because in
 
02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
the 15 years I've been leading intact
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
America I've heard from
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds um no thousands of mothers with
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
similar stories on the delivery table or
 
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
the morning after giving him birth a
 
02:24:21.309 --> 02:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
doctor or nurse approached them and said
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to circumcise him right or
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's time for his circumcision or it's
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
just a snip it won't hurt or when I said
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure they told me he'll thank
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
you for it later other organizations
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
committed to protect protecting babies
 
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
from painful penis reduction surgery
 
02:24:41.230 --> 02:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
non-medically necessary surgery that's
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
what it is receive the same kinds of
 
02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
complaints in 2020 to verif ver ify the
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
extent of such overt solicitation intact
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
America conducted a national survey we
 
02:24:54.510 --> 02:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
found that new mothers were asked an
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
average of eight times if they wanted to
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
have their boy circumcised even if the
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
mother said no the first time the rate
 
02:25:03.269 --> 02:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
was higher for women of color who
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
disproportionately are enrolled in
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I believe these women were
 
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
targeted because doctors know Medicaid
 
02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
will pay for the procedure despite the
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary among the known
 
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
complications of circumcision are
 
02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
Hemorrhage closure of the urinary
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
opening mangling partial or total
 
02:25:23.309 --> 02:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
amputation of the penis and even in rare
 
02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
instances death why would any parent if
 
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
fully informed put their child at risk
 
02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
from these events if circumcision were a
 
02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
baby product a swing a cradle a toy the
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
consumer product safety commission would
 
02:25:39.469 --> 02:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
prohibit its
 
02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
sale please stop please start wrapping
 
02:25:44.110 --> 02:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
up ma'am sorry please start wrapping up
 
02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
your testimony the circumcision
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
transparency act will ensure that
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
parents are fully informed before a
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
doctor takes a knife to the baby's
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
genitals the ACT will stop healthc Care
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
Professionals from aggressively
 
02:25:57.550 --> 02:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
soliciting parents to say yes to
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
circumcision finally the ACT will ensure
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
that parents not be automatically
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
compelled to consent to donate in quotes
 
02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
their son's foreskin to pharmaceutical
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
and cosmetic manufacturers who pay
 
02:26:11.790 --> 02:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals handsomely for the same tissue
 
02:26:14.190 --> 02:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
that parents have been told is useless
 
02:26:17.389 --> 02:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
and unimportant if not pathological a
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
child's body belongs to himself a penis
 
02:26:21.870 --> 02:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
with its forkin intact is as easy to
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
clean as a finger or toe the forkin
 
02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
keeps pathogens from entering the
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
urinary tract during babyhood protects
 
02:26:30.469 --> 02:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
the head of his penis from chafing
 
02:26:32.429 --> 02:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
drying out and losing sensitivity over
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
time and ensures that when the child
 
02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
reaches adulthood he and his partner
 
02:26:37.870 --> 02:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
will experience sex the way nature
 
02:26:40.349 --> 02:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
intended I urge you to approve and
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%

sir my name is Matthew Goodwin I'm here
 
02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
today to speak as the primary author on
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
a pending publication that broadly
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
assess the quality of circumcision
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
consent forms issued by Major Hospital
 
02:27:49.389 --> 02:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
syst systems in New England of which new
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
H New Hampshire is included our current
 
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
data set which encompasses information
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
collected from more than 40 hospitals
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
represents the largest assembly of
 
02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
consent forms related to
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
circumcision ever
 
02:28:07.389 --> 02:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
compiled these forms were reviewed for
 
02:28:07.399 --> 02:28:08.590 align:start position:0%
compiled these forms were reviewed for
their

02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:28:11.790 --> 02:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
content the findings are deeply
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
concerning we observe a striking
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
variation from hospital to hospital
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
about what risks are being disclosed on
 
02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
these forms while some forms list more
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
than 10 risks associated with
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
circumcision others only list three to
 
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
four some forms do not list any risks at
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
all but simply State my doctor has
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
explained all the risks to me leaving us
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
to wonder what was actually
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
stated is it right that some parents
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
know only of a few risks While others
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
know many
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
more is it fair that some parents see
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
this in writing While others only hear
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
it I would also argue a consent form
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
that lists death as a distinct
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
possibility is very different for one
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
that does
 
02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
not most concerning is the observation
 
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
that some hospitals include terms and
 
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
conditions on their forms to enable
 
02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
harvesting of the amputated forkin
 
02:29:15.070 --> 02:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
tissue for research and or commercial
 
02:29:18.429 --> 02:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
use there is no means to op out of this
 
02:29:20.910 --> 02:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
as it is a term of the procedure
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
itself does a hospital that receives
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
financial compensation by selling
 
02:29:28.750 --> 02:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
neonatal foreskin tissue represent a
 
02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
conflict of
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
interest shouldn't parents have the
 
02:29:35.550 --> 02:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
option to decline participation in
 
02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:36.830 align:start position:0%
option to decline participation in
tissue

02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
tissue
 
02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
donation overall the data from this
 
02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
study clearly shows that parents are not
 
02:29:42.910 --> 02:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
getting the information they need from
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
their hospital to make a truly informed
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
decision and it calls for immediate
 
02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:50.150 align:start position:0%
decision and it calls for immediate
corrective

02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
corrective
 
02:29:52.349 --> 02:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
action this bill would strengthen
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
parental rights to informed consent by
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
providing them with the necessary
 
02:29:58.670 --> 02:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
information and safeguards so that they
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
can make a reasonable thoughtful
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
decision this bill would also serve to
 
02:30:06.349 --> 02:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
protect hospitals doctors and nurses by
 
02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
reducing legal liabilities related to
 
02:30:12.790 --> 02:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
improper informed consent
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%

improvements propos osed in the bill
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
there is less ambiguity about what
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
information is being presented and who
 
02:30:23.469 --> 02:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
has agreed to the
 
02:30:26.269 --> 02:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
procedure based on the large discrepancy
 
02:30:28.630 --> 02:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
and risk documented and presented to
 
02:30:32.190 --> 02:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
parents we anticipate the standard of
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
care being questioned at some of these
 
02:30:37.630 --> 02:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals New Hampshire hospitals can
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
Shield themselves from the scrutiny by
 
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
elevating the current practices to a
 
02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
higher level of care most importantly
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
this bill gives many more children the
 
02:30:50.190 --> 02:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make a decision about
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
their own body by slowing the decision
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
process one that does not need to be
 
02:30:57.790 --> 02:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
rushed and determined at Birth thank you
 
02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you any
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing not representative
 
02:31:05.469 --> 02:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
Lon uh thank you if that paper is
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
published or if you have a pre-draft
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
publication that you can share with the
 
02:31:09.630 --> 02:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
committee um that would be greatly
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
appreciated I will see if I could do
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
that yes thank you other
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative kushman
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you Mr chairman
 
02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
um so I'm looking at the um American
 
02:31:28.030 --> 02:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
medical association's ethical guidelines
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
and uh part of it under patient rights
 
02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
says that uh the doctors shall advise
 
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
their patients of any conflicts of
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
interest that they may have in respect
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
to care um would you say that they are
 
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
not upholding that part of their um
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
ethical code if they're not informing
 
02:31:47.389 --> 02:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
patients that the hospital is getting
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
money from the harvesting of forkins
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
yeah they are not revealing their
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.710 --> 02:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
interest other
 
02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak and again
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's a tough one Anthony Los quers
 
02:32:15.150 --> 02:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
Quadro Los Quadro okay Health equality
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
campaign uh and again welcome sir you've
 
02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
indicated five to six minutes again I'll
 
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
have to ask you to keep it close to

documents that'll you can refer to as
I'm

02:32:37.790 --> 02:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
speaking I'll try to keep my comments
 
02:32:41.469 --> 02:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
brief because a lot of it is I Don't
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
Want To Tread over old territory already
 
02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
but uh my name is Anthony L Squad I'm
 
02:32:48.429 --> 02:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
the director of the health equality
 
02:32:48.439 --> 02:32:50.150 align:start position:0%
the director of the health equality
campaign

02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh I represent the growing chorus Across
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
America that advocate for higher
 
02:32:57.670 --> 02:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
standards for bodily autonomy of
 
02:32:59.790 --> 02:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
children specifically when it comes to
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
routine infant circumcision which I call
 
02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh cosmetic but specifically I just cut
 
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
um the uh the consent
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
bill uh HB 1706 is an important bill
 
02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
that's needed to reform the informed
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
consent process because routine infant
 
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
circumcision needs to be held to a
 
02:33:27.150 --> 02:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
higher standard since it's a proxy
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
decision that's not medically necessary
 
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's a decision that's essentially
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
forced on another person with potential
 
02:33:36.269 --> 02:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
lifelong consequences to his physical
 
02:33:39.309 --> 02:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
being his future sexuality his
 
02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
psychology and one that violates his
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
body autonomy or right to choose for
 
02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
himself hospitals often use inadequate
 
02:33:49.710 --> 02:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
consent forms typically generic
 
02:33:52.269 --> 02:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
fill-in-the blank forms that rely on an
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
oral discussion between the parents and
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
whomever health care worker is on duty
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
at the time in maternity the discussions
 
02:34:03.790 --> 02:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
are often brief and they can be biased
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
based on the provider's uh Viewpoint new
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
parents also have a lot of
 
02:34:10.670 --> 02:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about what circumcision
 
02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
is if it's necessary and how it's done
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
I've attached several consent forms used
 
02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
for circum incision from New Hampshire
 
02:34:20.510 --> 02:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals that we obtained some
 
02:34:22.870 --> 02:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals refuse to disclose their
 
02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
consent forms like the birth center at
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth even to expecting parents
 
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
citing Hospital
 
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
policy why don't they want people to
 
02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
know what their consent forms say in
 
02:34:38.670 --> 02:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
advance since the decision to circumcise
 
02:34:40.830 --> 02:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
is a proxy decision we need to hold the
 
02:34:43.389 --> 02:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
consent form to a higher standard than
 
02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
general surgery based on our research in
 
02:34:48.269 --> 02:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
conversations with parents a
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
circumcision decision is usually rushed
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
and the mother is in a vulnerable
 
02:34:54.750 --> 02:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
condition after birth and maybe under
 
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
the influence of
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
anesthesia now for instance when an
 
02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
adult undergoes general surgery it
 
02:35:02.110 --> 02:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
typically involves multiple doctor
 
02:35:05.790 --> 02:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
visits testing diagnosing discussions on
 
02:35:08.670 --> 02:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
the issue maybe second opinions and the
 
02:35:10.349 --> 02:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
patient has time to research and make
 
02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
the best decision for himself so it's a
 
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
very different scenario between routine
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
infant circumcision and adult general
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
surgery so why don't we have different
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
consent forms now I know doctors really
 
02:35:23.550 --> 02:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
care about their patients and they want
 
02:35:26.910 --> 02:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
the best outcome for them 1706 will help
 
02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
doctors provide better care for their
 
02:35:30.910 --> 02:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
patients by giving parents the
 
02:35:33.550 --> 02:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
information they need it will reinforce
 
02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
the doctor patient relationship because
 
02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
parents will appreciate getting more
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
information to help them to make this
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
decision that likely never came up
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
before it'll help avoid regret parents
 
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
and it'll help avoid disgruntled young
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
men who feel their autonomy was violated
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
with very few options after the fact
 
02:35:53.269 --> 02:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
please start wrapping up
 
02:35:56.950 --> 02:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
sure uh in my uh handout uh on page
 
02:35:59.070 --> 02:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
three it highlights a real life case in
 
02:36:01.349 --> 02:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
Florida where aom Heather heronimus who
 
02:36:02.910 --> 02:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
in a dispute with the father of her
 
02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
child was placed in jail over her
 
02:36:07.710 --> 02:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
refusal to sign a circumcision consent
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
form she ultimately signed the consent
 
02:36:13.469 --> 02:36:13.479 align:start position:0%
form in court in handcuffs in tears and
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
if she didn't she would have been
 
02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
remanded back to jail by the
 
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
judge um I'm just going to skip over
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
some parts also on the issue of tissue
 
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
forkin donation many Hospital consent
 
02:36:27.269 --> 02:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
forms based on our research and Exhibits
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
require tissue donation there are
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
for-profit public companies that
 
02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
essentially purchased this tissue from
 
02:36:35.469 --> 02:36:35.479 align:start position:0%
hospitals for use in cosmetic and
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
biotech products in fact there's one in
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts called organogenesis that
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
has contracts with area hospitals just
 
02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
to do that I know because I did the
 
02:36:47.429 --> 02:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
research and I wrote an article on it
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
and I based My article based on uh
 
02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
internal company documents it's a big
 
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
business and they even sell it on Amazon
 
02:36:57.990 --> 02:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
if you look up human neonatal forkin
 
02:36:59.950 --> 02:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
fiberblast it's
 
02:37:03.550 --> 02:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
$427 51 with prime shipping please wrap
 
02:37:08.990 --> 02:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
default you all
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
set are there are there any
 
02:37:17.269 --> 02:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
questions my representative mlan thank
 
02:37:18.750 --> 02:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
question I'm a little bit concerned by
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
one of the comments that you made that
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
that Dartmouth would not release their
 
02:37:29.150 --> 02:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
consent forms in advance um was that a
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
communication that you had with them is
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
that hearsay um and do you know the
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind that um I called that's

the rules and the and the and the and
 
02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:10.830 --> 02:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you again I'm going to be

along get back on schedule um this bill
 
02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh moves infant circumcision from a
 
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
covered Medicaid expense in New
 
02:40:23.070 --> 02:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this law has passed in
 
02:40:25.630 --> 02:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
similarity in 17 States I'm going to
 
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
pass around a bunch of information
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
specifically on the cost reductions and
 
02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
some other testimony um provided to me
 
02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
um the cost reductions to the state is
 
02:40:37.710 --> 02:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
estimated at $90,000 if we no longer
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
covered it I would estimate it's a lot
 
02:40:41.790 --> 02:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
larger than that based on that is just
 
02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
for the billing codes it does not
 
02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
include the facility charge uh provider
 
02:40:48.269 --> 02:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
charges supplies that sort of thing in
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
addition there's about a 10% revision
 
02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
rate reported so I got the billing codes
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
for that for children in New Hampshire
 
02:40:58.750 --> 02:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
over the past five years and it's
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
$177,000 in billing codes just to repair
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
circumcisions for New Hampshire the past
 
02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:04.590 align:start position:0%
circumcisions for New Hampshire the past
five

02:41:04.590 --> 02:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:41:09.309 --> 02:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
years that's it any questions any
 
02:41:11.389 --> 02:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
Parmer so I in that last part so so
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
let's say somebody has a circum their
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
child is circumcised they went through
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
the whole thing they really read up
 
02:41:23.150 --> 02:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
about it they knew exactly what they're
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
doing that's what they wanted to do they
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
have Medicaid they paid for it out of
 
02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
pocket to have the circumcision now they
 
02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
have a complication are they not going
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to get medical coverage for
 
02:41:35.950 --> 02:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
repair no I suggest we do cover it
 
02:41:37.870 --> 02:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
because that is an injury what I suggest
 
02:41:39.389 --> 02:41:39.399 align:start position:0%
is that it would be reduced there
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be follow-up care if we stop
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
covering or encourage them to not happen
 
02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
through coverage so that's what I trying
 
02:41:48.910 --> 02:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
to paint yes yes please help the
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
children yes oh yeah representative
 
02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman um you
 
02:41:57.469 --> 02:41:57.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned um some of the fiscal note
 
02:41:59.469 --> 02:41:59.479 align:start position:0%
analysis on how much this will reduce
 
02:42:02.830 --> 02:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
costs um but are you aware of how um
 
02:42:05.429 --> 02:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
taking away a benefit um being covered
 
02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
by Medicaid um affects the market cost
 
02:42:12.309 --> 02:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
across the board of of a procedure or
 
02:42:14.990 --> 02:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
intervention yes um thank you so if you
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
reduce the demand on something um you
 
02:42:20.269 --> 02:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
know the price the market price is going
 
02:42:22.269 --> 02:42:22.279 align:start position:0%
to come down I believe in other states
 
02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
um when people pay a cash price for this
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
procedure it's very simple as the um my
 
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative friend said they kind of
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
go Corral all the male babies and they
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
line them up and they do it all at the
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
same time so it's actually relatively
 
02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
inexpensive um when Medicaid is not
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
paying for it driving the costs up
 
02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
because there's so much demand thank you
 
02:42:42.790 --> 02:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative Shapiro
 
02:42:47.550 --> 02:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:42:49.950 --> 02:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
taking the question so just to be clear
 
02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
I think I am clear but just to be clear
 
02:42:58.510 --> 02:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh a a lowincome Jewish or Muslim family
 
02:43:02.110 --> 02:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
that has a child and chooses to have a
 
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
circumcision that's kind of dictated by
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
religious observance but choose to have
 
02:43:09.550 --> 02:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
it in a medical facility
 
02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
because maybe because of some of the
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
risks that you've been talking about um
 
02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
so a medical facility would allow for
 
02:43:21.150 --> 02:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
more hygiene um more medical backup um
 
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
so those Services currently are covered
 
02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
by Medicaid but they will not be if this
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill passes correct in a medical
 
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
facility I don't see it as a benefit to
 
02:43:33.150 --> 02:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
poor children I think that we're saving
 
02:43:36.830 --> 02:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
them by doing this because thank you
 
02:43:40.030 --> 02:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
okay other
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%

representing ringe Jaffrey and Dublin
 
02:44:08.590 --> 02:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
this bill stops the coverage of the
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
Cosmetic circumcision for infants under
 
02:44:13.790 --> 02:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
the State Medicaid plan uh infant uh
 
02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
circumcision is a serious humans rights
 
02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
violation uh a German Court held um any
 
02:44:21.590 --> 02:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
benefit to circumcision can be obtained
 
02:44:23.790 --> 02:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
by delaying the procedure until the male
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
is old enough to give his own fully
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
informed consent with the option of
 
02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
delaying circumcision providing all the
 
02:44:32.190 --> 02:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
purported benefits circumcising an
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
infant is an unnecessarily unnecessary
 
02:44:37.070 --> 02:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
violation of his bodily Integrity as
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%

perception of the practice will dissolve
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%

awareness in the United States about the

brutal nature of the circumcision is
 
02:45:13.630 --> 02:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
becoming more prant when
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
circumcision uh will be legally
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
recognized as inhumane the state will be
 
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
exposed to considerable Financial
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
liabilities uh this will necessitate
 
02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
compensating individuals who underwent
 
02:45:28.349 --> 02:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
the procedure funded by Medicaid or even
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh something like a mass Tor lawsuit uh
 
02:45:33.469 --> 02:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
basically uh we're going to be looking
 
02:45:36.670 --> 02:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
at a tsunami of lawsuits in the future
 
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
um if the state continues to fund this
 
02:45:44.269 --> 02:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
so uh and given the profound widespread
 
02:45:46.349 --> 02:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
impact of circum decision on individuals
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of such a

re-evaluation are substantial and
 
02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
far-reaching um so any questions from
 
02:45:56.750 --> 02:45:56.760 align:start position:0%

record my name is uh Rob Barry I'm the

general counsel to the division of
 
02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um we are again here to provide
 
02:46:23.230 --> 02:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
information uh we are not taking a
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
position on the bill this bill would
 
02:46:29.670 --> 02:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
alter current practice in terms of what
 
02:46:31.469 --> 02:46:31.479 align:start position:0%
covered services are offered under the
 
02:46:33.630 --> 02:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program and it would also
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
require uh the department to engage in
 
02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
Prior authorizations for any
 
02:46:39.630 --> 02:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
circumcision procedure which we don't
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
currently do uh the only suggestion we
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
have for the bill is
 
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
in the medically necessary
 
02:46:54.030 --> 02:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
criteria on page one beginning on line
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
13 uh through lines
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
27 um it's a very prescriptive um number
 
02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
of um conditions that would qualify for
 
02:47:07.630 --> 02:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
this we would suggest having a little
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
bit more flexibility that if there are
 
02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
no conditions covered there uh that we
 
02:47:14.190 --> 02:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to cover
 
02:47:17.309 --> 02:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
circumcisions under um other medically
 
02:47:19.950 --> 02:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
necessary circumstances and I'm happy to
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%

thank you thank
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Weber could I just
 
02:48:09.190 --> 02:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
ask you for
 
02:48:11.389 --> 02:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
clarification um I believe the the
 
02:48:12.910 --> 02:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
question about whether you were acting
 
02:48:16.750 --> 02:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
as an attorney and I am I correct in
 
02:48:18.389 --> 02:48:18.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that it is not the
 
02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
practice of law when you are
 
02:48:23.389 --> 02:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
representing when you are an employe who
 
02:48:23.399 --> 02:48:24.830 align:start position:0%
representing when you are an employe who
is

02:48:24.830 --> 02:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:48:27.469 --> 02:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
representing the general
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:33.309 --> 02:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
employer now you're getting into
 
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
professional responsibility uh
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um my view of it
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
has always been that I'm here in my
 
02:48:42.670 --> 02:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
capacity as a representative of the
 
02:48:46.030 --> 02:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
department I am an attorney uh I try to
 
02:48:48.590 --> 02:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
abide by my professional responsibility
 
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
obligations while I'm doing so um so I
 
02:48:55.150 --> 02:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
view myself as having a high standard of
 
02:48:58.590 --> 02:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
cander to this committee and I do think
 
02:49:00.269 --> 02:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
I forgot to introduce myself in the
 
02:49:02.309 --> 02:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
previous hearing so I do apologize for
 
02:49:06.389 --> 02:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
that um but um yes I am here as a
 
02:49:08.110 --> 02:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
representative of the department and I
 
02:49:09.070 --> 02:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
am an
 
02:49:12.269 --> 02:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
attorney but but if I may be to Dead
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
Horse you are not here specifically or
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
offering legal advice to us that's
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
02:49:23.710 --> 02:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
Weber other
 
02:49:28.429 --> 02:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:31.349 --> 02:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Paige
 
02:49:34.190 --> 02:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
bman from national award
 
02:49:38.110 --> 02:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
4 I'm sorry oh I'm
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
sorry good morning thank you good
 
02:49:43.630 --> 02:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
morning it no no good afternoon um thank
 
02:49:47.429 --> 02:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
you again for those of you who are left
 
02:49:51.150 --> 02:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
um I this may be a little bit surprising
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
I am in the previous hearing very very
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
strongly in favor of additional
 
02:50:00.190 --> 02:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
education and consent I think it's very
 
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
important for all the reasons we've
 
02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:02.750 align:start position:0%
important for all the reasons we've
already

02:50:02.750 --> 02:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:50:05.870 --> 02:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
heard on the flip side I am here to
 
02:50:09.389 --> 02:50:09.399 align:start position:0%
speak against the Medicaid bill and the
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
reason is I don't think we're ready for
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
it yet right now
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
nationally uh circumcision has moved
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
from a few decades ago being about 85%
 
02:50:24.550 --> 02:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
of Americans C of boys were circumcised
 
02:50:26.510 --> 02:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
that has shifted in the last decade or
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
so to about 50% but that is regional um
 
02:50:33.630 --> 02:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
certain States tend more towards 10 to
 
02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
20% here in New Hampshire
 
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
76% of people currently circumcise their
 
02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
sons I'm coming at this from a a Health
 
02:50:48.469 --> 02:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
Equity and socioeconomic status
 
02:50:51.190 --> 02:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
perspective as well as mental health
 
02:50:54.229 --> 02:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
this bill which would impact something
 
02:50:56.190 --> 02:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
that is a deeply held belief for people
 
02:50:58.229 --> 02:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
right now for all the reasons we've said
 
02:51:00.269 --> 02:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
because there's not enough education
 
02:51:03.229 --> 02:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
right now it is a cultural norm and what
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
we will be doing is this will
 
02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect people who are
 
02:51:11.229 --> 02:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
lower income and of course people of
 
02:51:15.389 --> 02:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
color it then becomes a phys physical
 
02:51:17.790 --> 02:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
permanent marker of
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
poverty will that change yes am I in
 
02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
support of people staying intact yes but
 
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
is that the case now no and so I see
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
this as a as many of the things in
 
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
health that have become markers of
 
02:51:34.190 --> 02:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status previously the
 
02:51:36.229 --> 02:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
biggest example I can think of is
 
02:51:38.590 --> 02:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
Formula feeding versus breastfeeding
 
02:51:41.229 --> 02:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
where how you fed your baby was a marker
 
02:51:44.030 --> 02:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
of your income I see the potential for
 
02:51:46.630 --> 02:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
that happen happening and as such it has
 
02:51:49.429 --> 02:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
the potential to have a significant
 
02:51:52.030 --> 02:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the mental health of parents
 
02:51:54.269 --> 02:51:54.279 align:start position:0%
of which I am an expert the
 
02:51:56.229 --> 02:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
conversations that people have in their
 
02:51:59.389 --> 02:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
first few days postpartum stay with
 
02:52:02.910 --> 02:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
women for ever they remember these
 
02:52:05.630 --> 02:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
conversations and if we passed this and
 
02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
I had to do this and I had to have this
 
02:52:10.269 --> 02:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
conversation next week with people I
 
02:52:11.710 --> 02:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
have to go into somebody's room
 
02:52:13.830 --> 02:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
currently we're not opt out I have to
 
02:52:16.790 --> 02:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
ask them required or my job I have to
 
02:52:19.670 --> 02:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
ask them so when I go in and say are you
 
02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
planning on a
 
02:52:22.830 --> 02:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
circumcision I don't know who has
 
02:52:25.110 --> 02:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid yet so that adds work but the
 
02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
point is I go in and they say I want a
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
circumcision I am the person that has to
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
essentially say to them you don't get
 
02:52:36.150 --> 02:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
one because you're poor and for people
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
that still believe because of the lack
 
02:52:40.990 --> 02:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
of Education that this is something that
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
is best for their baby on day one
 
02:52:45.150 --> 02:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
there's the potential for them to
 
02:52:48.030 --> 02:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
already feel like a failure as a parent
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
and unable to provide what they see as
 
02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
something very important for their
 
02:52:56.229 --> 02:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
sons again I am hoping that we can
 
02:52:58.670 --> 02:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
provide the education do I think that
 
02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
this might be the right move in two
 
02:53:03.990 --> 02:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
years three years five years if we can
 
02:53:07.229 --> 02:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
shift our culture and we can bring that
 
02:53:10.990 --> 02:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
percentage down wrapping up yeah if we
 
02:53:13.469 --> 02:53:13.479 align:start position:0%
can bring that percentage down I think
 
02:53:16.229 --> 02:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
this bill makes a lot of sense fiscally
 
02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
right now I have concerns about mental
 
02:53:21.389 --> 02:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
health and about our marginalized
 
02:53:23.229 --> 02:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
communities thank you very much for
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
hearing me and again I'm Paige bman
 
02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh from Nash award 4
 
02:53:32.510 --> 02:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions uh yes sorry um
 
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative to for coming up again
 
02:53:39.030 --> 02:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
today um I believe that our Medicaid
 
02:53:40.870 --> 02:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
births are about half of births in the
 
02:53:43.269 --> 02:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire do you have data
 
02:53:46.229 --> 02:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
on what percentage of Medica of children
 
02:53:49.150 --> 02:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
Bor boys born with Medicaid are
 
02:53:51.309 --> 02:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
circumcised because I think that would
 
02:53:53.830 --> 02:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
be very interesting to know because with
 
02:53:58.429 --> 02:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
that 75% rate if if it's almost 100% in
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid population yet it's 5050 in
 
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
the non-medicaid population perhaps this
 
02:54:06.110 --> 02:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
actually might be reversed about an
 
02:54:08.030 --> 02:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
equity issue what do you think about
 
02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
that you actually need you to repeat the
 
02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
question I'm a little confused I'm sorry
 
02:54:14.950 --> 02:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
um so I guess first question question do
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
you have data on what the uh what the
 
02:54:20.150 --> 02:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
rate is in the Medicaid population I I
 
02:54:21.550 --> 02:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
would guess it exists but I don't have
 
02:54:26.349 --> 02:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
it I just have the total population
 
02:54:29.269 --> 02:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
percentage okay and then uh secondly uh
 
02:54:31.190 --> 02:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
my question would be that if it's either
 
02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
already evenly distributed or if there's
 
02:54:35.150 --> 02:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
a higher rate of circumcision in the
 
02:54:37.670 --> 02:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population do you think that
 
02:54:38.990 --> 02:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
maybe this issue is different than
 
02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
you're first perceiving
 
02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
it if it's 100% of the Medicaid
 
02:54:46.910 --> 02:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
population I if I'm understanding
 
02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
correctly would feel more strongly in
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
this way because then this that shows
 
02:54:53.870 --> 02:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
that the people who are in that
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
population see this as something that is
 
02:54:59.630 --> 02:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
very important and
 
02:55:01.429 --> 02:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
essential one more follow one more
 
02:55:03.309 --> 02:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
followup um thank you I'm just trying to
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
square that with your testimony before
 
02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
about making sure that we're providing
 
02:55:08.269 --> 02:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
adequate education and that we're having
 
02:55:10.269 --> 02:55:10.279 align:start position:0%
informed consent so I'm I'm getting
 
02:55:12.429 --> 02:55:12.439 align:start position:0%
having a hard trouble on comparing I
 
02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely understand that my my main
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
point here is that we're not ready for
 
02:55:20.910 --> 02:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
it right now I think right now step one
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
is to provide education and to shift the
 
02:55:24.479 --> 02:55:25.670 align:start position:0%
is to provide education and to shift the
cultural

02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
norms and so I am I I would advocate for
 
02:55:33.229 --> 02:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
this but when
 
02:55:35.950 --> 02:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
when when we have made that shift when
 
02:55:38.429 --> 02:55:38.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have such a social and
 
02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
emotional impact on
 
02:55:43.790 --> 02:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
people which I think we can get to but
 
02:55:47.229 --> 02:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
not right now representative kushman
 
02:55:48.670 --> 02:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:55:52.190 --> 02:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just to kind of
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
leap off of where um my colleague um
 
02:55:59.870 --> 02:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
just left us is it possible that if it's
 
02:56:02.790 --> 02:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
disincentivized um by being reimbursable
 
02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:03.590 align:start position:0%
disincentivized um by being reimbursable
under

02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:56:06.510 --> 02:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um because in other states
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
where where Medicaid covers circumcision
 
02:56:11.190 --> 02:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
the overall rates of the procedure are
 
02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
twice as high as states where Medicaid
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover it so um is it possible
 
02:56:23.269 --> 02:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
that um that if that is removed that
 
02:56:26.349 --> 02:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
incentive is no longer there that it it
 
02:56:28.990 --> 02:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
that the culture will follow and maybe
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the reasons why the
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
rates are higher
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
here if I may clarify you're you're
 
02:56:39.950 --> 02:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
asking um your your assumption is that
 
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
doctors or clinicians are incentivized
 
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
to offer circumcision
 
02:56:48.429 --> 02:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying they
 
02:56:50.750 --> 02:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
essentially are if it's a reimbursable
 
02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
event under Medicaid so there is a
 
02:56:56.510 --> 02:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
reason that the hospital policy would be
 
02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
to counsel every
 
02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
parent um on circumcision and recommend
 
02:57:06.429 --> 02:57:06.439 align:start position:0%
it versus letting it be just an elective
 
02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
thing that is only discussed if it's
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
brought up by the patient I I have
 
02:57:14.990 --> 02:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
experience in three different hospitals
 
02:57:17.309 --> 02:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
and a birth center facility and that's
 
02:57:18.590 --> 02:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:57:22.110 --> 02:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
anecdotal I I'm almost uh you know
 
02:57:23.790 --> 02:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
trying to stay non- emotional I I'm
 
02:57:28.150 --> 02:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
almost offended at the presumption that
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
people who have gone into a clinical
 
02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
field to take care of people are are
 
02:57:35.110 --> 02:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
pushing procedures on people to make
 
02:57:38.110 --> 02:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
money I have never experienced that with
 
02:57:40.229 --> 02:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
the people I work with it's not the
 
02:57:43.469 --> 02:57:43.479 align:start position:0%
attitude I have ever heard other people
 
02:57:46.469 --> 02:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
being exposed to I know there are cases
 
02:57:48.510 --> 02:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
where people have seen that happen I
 
02:57:51.389 --> 02:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
have not experienced that I don't
 
02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
personally believe in practice that that
 
02:57:57.950 --> 02:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
is why we ask people for the same
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
reasons that I am not in favor of this
 
02:58:02.190 --> 02:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
bill I would not be in favor of an optin
 
02:58:03.590 --> 02:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
versus an opt
 
02:58:07.229 --> 02:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
out just right now because people expect
 
02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
it they wait for us to come in and ask
 
02:58:14.670 --> 02:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
them they're not going to ask us even
 
02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
if even if they want it they are going
 
02:58:23.630 --> 02:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
to wait for us to offer it to them so I
 
02:58:26.670 --> 02:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
um I've lost track of where we were with
 
02:58:28.830 --> 02:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
that um but no I do not think it's
 
02:58:30.670 --> 02:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
incentivized and when you give me that
 
02:58:32.830 --> 02:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
statistic and say Well when it's not
 
02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
covered there are half the circumcisions
 
02:58:37.950 --> 02:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't that make sense because half of
 
02:58:40.070 --> 02:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
them are not being paid for so of course
 
02:58:41.550 --> 02:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
there would be fewer because fewer
 
02:58:43.510 --> 02:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
people have the fewer people have the
 
02:58:46.510 --> 02:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
option to choose that that's one way to
 
02:58:49.550 --> 02:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
look at it yeah I I'm I'm talking about
 
02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
being able to choose what's right for
 
02:58:54.469 --> 02:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
your children and the way to do that is
 
02:58:57.309 --> 02:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
by educating people we educate people to
 
02:59:00.309 --> 02:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
make the informed consent for themselves
 
02:59:03.710 --> 02:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
instead of forcing them into something
 
02:59:06.870 --> 02:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
because they're poor if we are not going
 
02:59:11.190 --> 02:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
to make this if we are not going to ban
 
02:59:14.590 --> 02:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
this outright for everybody we have no
 
02:59:17.750 --> 02:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
place to be putting this on poor people
 
02:59:21.030 --> 02:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
and as a person that comes from poverty
 
02:59:23.630 --> 02:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that this would be
 
02:59:27.269 --> 02:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
painful and it is not okay to do this to
 
02:59:30.229 --> 02:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
people other questions to penalize them
 
02:59:33.510 --> 02:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
for being poor other any other
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:40.030 --> 02:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank
 
02:59:53.030 --> 02:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:57.950 --> 02:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
s good afternoon yeah good
 
03:00:01.469 --> 03:00:01.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon good afternoon
 
03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
03:00:05.670 --> 03:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh and thank you uh Mr
 
03:00:07.510 --> 03:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and committee members for this
 
03:00:09.469 --> 03:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you in support
 
03:00:11.389 --> 03:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
03:00:14.389 --> 03:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
1683 although I'd like to suggest a
 
03:00:14.399 --> 03:00:15.910 align:start position:0%
1683 although I'd like to suggest a
small

03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
small
 
03:00:18.309 --> 03:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
amendment I can certainly understand
 
03:00:20.229 --> 03:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
that you are attempting to ensure that
 
03:00:21.510 --> 03:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
the money that the state of New
 
03:00:23.510 --> 03:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as investing in the state
 
03:00:26.190 --> 03:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
Medicare Plan is used for appropriate
 
03:00:28.590 --> 03:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
purposes however reading this bill I
 
03:00:31.309 --> 03:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
noticed one area that was not included
 
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
in coverage this is when a documented
 
03:00:38.309 --> 03:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
family history indicates that a serious
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
health condition will likely arise
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
unless a circumcision is performed
 
03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
previously for my family and me this was
 
03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
not just a theoretical but in fact
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
resulted in severe Health emergencies
 
03:00:52.510 --> 03:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
for my family
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
members within my immediate family I
 
03:00:57.950 --> 03:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
know for certain of five males who
 
03:01:00.710 --> 03:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
required emergency cir circumcisions in
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
their lives as early as a teen and as
 
03:01:05.150 --> 03:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
late as in their
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
50s all of them hoped that they would
 
03:01:10.030 --> 03:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
not encounter this medical condition
 
03:01:12.790 --> 03:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
known as fosis which is a condition
 
03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
where the foreskin cannot be pulled back
 
03:01:17.429 --> 03:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
from the head of the penis but when the
 
03:01:19.110 --> 03:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
pain was too severe or when
 
03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances forced the issue they all
 
03:01:24.150 --> 03:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
had to undergo adult circumcisions in
 
03:01:26.229 --> 03:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
situations that were not optimal for
 
03:01:28.830 --> 03:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
health care and certainly were not were
 
03:01:30.950 --> 03:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
much more costly than the cost of
 
03:01:32.469 --> 03:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
circumcision of a
 
03:01:34.910 --> 03:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
newborn if you are wondering why this
 
03:01:37.229 --> 03:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
type of condition has not been mentioned
 
03:01:39.790 --> 03:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
much in public I would suggest that this
 
03:01:41.950 --> 03:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
is because men are not willing to share
 
03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
this kind of story with others and will
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
often suffer in silence hoping that the
 
03:01:49.630 --> 03:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
condition will resolve itself it usually
 
03:01:52.389 --> 03:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
does not and that is why I I'm asking
 
03:01:54.750 --> 03:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
you to consider an amendment in the list
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
of allowable conditions for the
 
03:01:59.150 --> 03:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
circumcision in your I think was
 
03:02:02.550 --> 03:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph three adding a a new section k
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
for documented family history that
 
03:02:07.030 --> 03:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
suggests a high likelihood that a
 
03:02:08.790 --> 03:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
serious health condition will arise in
 
03:02:11.670 --> 03:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
the future looking at the bill before
 
03:02:13.790 --> 03:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
you I ask you to consider how much pain
 
03:02:15.990 --> 03:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
and suffering can be mitigated when
 
03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
newborns with a family history of fosis
 
03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
are provided with this covered
 
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
circumcision but covering adults who who
 
03:02:28.630 --> 03:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
um who um have fosis will need who need
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
this operation later in life will almost
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
certainly save money for the state as
 
03:02:36.309 --> 03:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
well allow me to tell you a little bit
 
03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
about my family's relevant experiences
 
03:02:41.830 --> 03:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
my father like me was born in Hungary
 
03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
and during World War II he was a drafted
 
03:02:47.229 --> 03:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
into the Hungarian Army and served as an
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
officer for 2 years he was only 22 years
 
03:02:53.070 --> 03:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
old when during his military deployment
 
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
he encountered such severe pain due to
 
03:02:58.389 --> 03:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
fosis that he asked to be circumcised in
 
03:03:01.429 --> 03:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
a military hospital this was very
 
03:03:02.950 --> 03:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous at the time because
 
03:03:05.950 --> 03:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
circumcised men if captured by German
 
03:03:08.469 --> 03:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
Allied Forces would be suspected of
 
03:03:10.710 --> 03:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
being Jewish and could be sent to
 
03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:12.269 align:start position:0%
being Jewish and could be sent to
concentration

03:03:12.269 --> 03:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
concentration
 
03:03:14.469 --> 03:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
camps um
 
03:03:16.510 --> 03:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
he realized the danger but had the
 
03:03:19.790 --> 03:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
operation performed nonetheless my son
 
03:03:22.269 --> 03:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
had a very similar encounter he was
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
attending his second year at West Point
 
03:03:26.830 --> 03:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
when he too found himself suffering from
 
03:03:29.790 --> 03:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
fosis and decided to have a circumcision
 
03:03:32.990 --> 03:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
in a hospital near West Point my brother
 
03:03:35.150 --> 03:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
was only in his teens when he too
 
03:03:38.510 --> 03:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
experienced severe pain and required his
 
03:03:40.990 --> 03:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
circumcision one of my brother's sons
 
03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
had the same experience when he was in
 
03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
his 20s
 
03:03:46.990 --> 03:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
finally when I was in my 50s it was my
 
03:03:50.110 --> 03:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
turn at that time in my life I thought
 
03:03:52.590 --> 03:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
that I had beaten the odds but my luck
 
03:03:55.429 --> 03:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
had just run out I started to suffer
 
03:03:58.790 --> 03:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
increasing increasingly uh um increasing
 
03:04:02.229 --> 03:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
pain due to fosis which included tears
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
in my foreskin as well as bleeding be
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
could please stop wrapping up yes having
 
03:04:10.990 --> 03:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
intimate relations with my wife kept uh
 
03:04:13.830 --> 03:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
kept getting more and more painful fin I
 
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
too had to have a
 
03:04:18.389 --> 03:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
circumcision all five of us recovered
 
03:04:20.550 --> 03:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
quickly and had no further health
 
03:04:24.670 --> 03:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
problems after the operation uh and
 
03:04:26.990 --> 03:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
either from the operation or
 
03:04:29.950 --> 03:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
subsequently so thank you Mr chairman
 
03:04:31.750 --> 03:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to answer any questions
 
03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
if they they are asked I also have a
 
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
handout I can give to everyone okay yeah
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
if you can pass that around and
 
03:04:39.950 --> 03:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro has a question
 
03:04:42.910 --> 03:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um other than your
 
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
very compelling personal story about
 
03:04:49.150 --> 03:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
this have you done any Research into
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether um the occurrence of fosis fosis
 
03:04:57.550 --> 03:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
which i' never heard before to be
 
03:04:59.670 --> 03:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest do you have you done
 
03:05:02.750 --> 03:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
any research to see if there is a
 
03:05:05.910 --> 03:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
genetic um component to that if there is
 
03:05:08.670 --> 03:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
if it is if it is frequently like
 
03:05:12.070 --> 03:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
evidently in your family is if is there
 
03:05:14.670 --> 03:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
if it's frequently involves a family
 
03:05:17.110 --> 03:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
history um I I can't say that I have a
 
03:05:19.870 --> 03:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
very extensive research on that uh
 
03:05:22.269 --> 03:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
obviously in my family it was pretty
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
obvious and uh I have found many sources
 
03:05:30.389 --> 03:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
that impl impl implicate the the idea
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
that this does carry through the family
 
03:05:35.229 --> 03:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
in the male component uh and I've had
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
conversations with a number of doctors
 
03:05:40.150 --> 03:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
about this uh for example the the doctor
 
03:05:42.830 --> 03:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
that performed my circumcision he too
 
03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
said that it is known that this is a
 
03:05:48.190 --> 03:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
this can be a family thing that is
 
03:05:51.510 --> 03:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
passed down from one to another and um
 
03:05:54.910 --> 03:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
so I I do think that this is this is one
 
03:05:56.830 --> 03:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
of those conditions that I think
 
03:05:58.950 --> 03:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes gets neglected because more
 
03:06:00.830 --> 03:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
often we we hear about this as a
 
03:06:03.670 --> 03:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
religious issue uh my father was
 
03:06:05.429 --> 03:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
Catholic and not Jewish so it was not a
 
03:06:07.510 --> 03:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
religious issue for him or a cosmetic
 
03:06:11.110 --> 03:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
issue and uh but when it gets to a point
 
03:06:12.590 --> 03:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
when you can't bear it anymore as an
 
03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
adult it's a much more serious operation
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
than as a as a newborn so that's why I'm
 
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
asking you incidentally in this bill it
 
03:06:24.229 --> 03:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
does mention fimosis after puberty as a
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
condition that's covered and I would
 
03:06:28.229 --> 03:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
suggest that if there was a real family
 
03:06:30.190 --> 03:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
history this happening we shouldn't be
 
03:06:33.389 --> 03:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
waiting that long thank you for your
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
testimony uh representative fedus yes
 
03:06:39.550 --> 03:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and thank you for
 
03:06:43.750 --> 03:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
taking this my question is um the
 
03:06:46.229 --> 03:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
Factor about Medicaid you don't object
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
in any way the Medicaid would reject
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
this here we're asking to not
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
include so is Medicaid a factor in your
 
03:06:58.429 --> 03:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
testimony this
 
03:07:01.309 --> 03:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
morning my my my suggestion for my
 
03:07:04.870 --> 03:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
amendment is that under the uh areas
 
03:07:06.510 --> 03:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
that are covered under the state
 
03:07:10.469 --> 03:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
Medicare Pro program that family history
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
demonstrated fam documented family
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
history should be included okay followup
 
03:07:20.349 --> 03:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
follow um I understood that part my just
 
03:07:23.590 --> 03:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
basic question is do you object to the
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid being included or circumcision
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
being included in Medicaid it sounds
 
03:07:32.349 --> 03:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
like they want to not have that covered
 
03:07:34.110 --> 03:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
by Medicaid and I don't think that
 
03:07:36.990 --> 03:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
should be the case well I think if I
 
03:07:38.389 --> 03:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
understand your in the question
 
03:07:40.590 --> 03:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
direction of your question is whether I
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
think that should be covered by Medicaid
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
or not and it seems to me uh that in my
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
situation if I was a recipient of
 
03:07:51.550 --> 03:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and I had a demonstrated uh uh
 
03:07:54.229 --> 03:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
history family history of this happening
 
03:07:55.950 --> 03:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
I think it should be covered because
 
03:07:58.190 --> 03:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's almost like uh well I'm pretty sure
 
03:08:00.190 --> 03:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get it at some point and
 
03:08:03.110 --> 03:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is a much more cost effective and
 
03:08:07.229 --> 03:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
it it avoids many painful years later
 
03:08:10.349 --> 03:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
on Mr chair Al set thank you that was
 
03:08:13.110 --> 03:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
the answer I was looking for thank you
 
03:08:14.830 --> 03:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
glad to do it thank you thank you any
 
03:08:17.309 --> 03:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
other questions I'm seeing none thank
 
03:08:19.870 --> 03:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
you very much thank
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
03:08:32.229 --> 03:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you again Mr chair and
 
03:08:36.630 --> 03:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
honorable members um once again my name
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
is Ellen Reed representing Rockingham 10
 
03:08:40.309 --> 03:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
new market and new fields and I am happy
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
to see my former colleague The Honorable
 
03:08:46.030 --> 03:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
uh Peter somuch in the room who is in
 
03:08:48.269 --> 03:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
favor of the underlying bill with the
 
03:08:50.790 --> 03:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that I would also agree to to
 
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
um exempt or allow for Medicaid coverage
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
of people with a a family history um the
 
03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
reason I am a co-sponsor on this bill is
 
03:09:00.910 --> 03:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
because I believe in the separation of
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
church and state and to the extent that
 
03:09:06.190 --> 03:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
this is predominantly a religious and
 
03:09:09.469 --> 03:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
cultural and not a medical uh procedure
 
03:09:12.229 --> 03:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
when it's done automatically um it
 
03:09:13.870 --> 03:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
really has NOS business being paid for
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
by by the taxpayers there's no other no
 
03:09:19.110 --> 03:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
other I I kind of challenge anybody to
 
03:09:21.670 --> 03:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
find another strictly cultural
 
03:09:24.269 --> 03:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
non-medically necessary procedure that
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
we cover with with public taxpayer money
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we do in fact there
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
are many medically necessary things that
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
we don't cover with taxpayer money so
 
03:09:37.229 --> 03:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
again to the extent that it is not
 
03:09:39.309 --> 03:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
medically necessary the only issue
 
03:09:41.429 --> 03:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
there's been talk about well infections
 
03:09:43.950 --> 03:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever and this of course is except
 
03:09:45.550 --> 03:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
for all the exemptions in the bill and
 
03:09:47.309 --> 03:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
the one that The Honorable samsic has
 
03:09:50.590 --> 03:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
has mentioned um the only studies that
 
03:09:53.510 --> 03:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
have given kind of mixed results was the
 
03:09:56.670 --> 03:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
potential for the prevention of future
 
03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
STI and as was previously testified to
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
those predominantly fell on what the
 
03:10:06.510 --> 03:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
hygiene of that culture was in general
 
03:10:09.670 --> 03:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
but um not only has every physician
 
03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
organization in the western world or I
 
03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
say actually the almost the entire world
 
03:10:18.150 --> 03:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
including our own say that automatic
 
03:10:20.190 --> 03:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
circumcision is not medically necessary
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
I just want to read from NIH which is of
 
03:10:24.710 --> 03:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
course our federal National Institutes
 
03:10:26.750 --> 03:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
of Health um this is from their sexually
 
03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
transmitted infections and male
 
03:10:30.349 --> 03:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
circumcision a systematic review and the
 
03:10:32.070 --> 03:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
quote is consequently the prevention of
 
03:10:33.870 --> 03:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted infections cannot
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
rationally be interpreted as a benefit
 
03:10:35.439 --> 03:10:37.070 align:start position:0%
rationally be interpreted as a benefit
of

03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:10:40.229 --> 03:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
circumcision there you go so it's not
 
03:10:42.469 --> 03:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
medically necessary I do want to address
 
03:10:44.830 --> 03:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
comments that were made earlier by my
 
03:10:46.990 --> 03:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
friend who's the new uh member in the
 
03:10:50.710 --> 03:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
house uh about um The Mark of poverty I
 
03:10:53.550 --> 03:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
myself grew up in South Memphis we were
 
03:10:56.670 --> 03:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
always on public assistance um we I
 
03:10:59.150 --> 03:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
lived in a condemned house for a long
 
03:11:02.110 --> 03:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
time without plumbing and heat so I
 
03:11:04.389 --> 03:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
understand when she talks about marks of
 
03:11:05.870 --> 03:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
poverty I take that really really
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
seriously and it did actually I
 
03:11:08.950 --> 03:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
considered that deeply when we were
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
talking about that before this hearing
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
um however that same representative
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
testified on the previous bill that she
 
03:11:19.830 --> 03:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
herself has left her three sons intact
 
03:11:23.309 --> 03:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
so one can now say why if this is such a
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
terrible Mark of poverty that gives
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
long-term psychological problems in our
 
03:11:28.469 --> 03:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
society because it's such a cultural
 
03:11:32.190 --> 03:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
norm why then did you Mark or rather not
 
03:11:35.309 --> 03:11:35.319 align:start position:0%
Mark uh your own Sons with that Mark of
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
poverty so in terms of Mark of poverty
 
03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and is this really a problem 17
 
03:11:42.229 --> 03:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
States already prohibit Medicaid funds
 
03:11:44.389 --> 03:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
from being being used for circumcision
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
medically non-necessary
 
03:11:50.510 --> 03:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision rather than it hurting poor
 
03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
children I would say that and I
 
03:11:54.910 --> 03:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
understand that as a nurse or as
 
03:11:56.590 --> 03:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
somebody having to tell a person that
 
03:11:57.950 --> 03:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
this isn't covered by Medicaid that that
 
03:12:00.030 --> 03:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
might be difficult and uncomfortable but
 
03:12:01.590 --> 03:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
the question is what is right so rather
 
03:12:03.309 --> 03:12:03.319 align:start position:0%
than saving poor rather than hurting
 
03:12:04.990 --> 03:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
poor children or marking them with
 
03:12:07.349 --> 03:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
poverty I think it's saving poor kids
 
03:12:11.309 --> 03:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
from being hurt for no good reason and
 
03:12:13.590 --> 03:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
please St wrapping up I am thank you and
 
03:12:16.469 --> 03:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
the $200,000 that we spend on
 
03:12:18.190 --> 03:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
circumcision and then the revisions from
 
03:12:20.429 --> 03:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
bot circumcision in this state from by
 
03:12:23.030 --> 03:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I think that that F those funds
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
could better be used to help poor
 
03:12:28.469 --> 03:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
children by providing pediatric eye care
 
03:12:30.670 --> 03:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
or dental care I think that better
 
03:12:33.469 --> 03:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
serves lowincome families and uh
 
03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
marginalized communities and finally
 
03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
back to the medical necessity again one
 
03:12:42.150 --> 03:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
in 16,000 people who are intact men who
 
03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
are intact fact uh experience a later
 
03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
need for adult circumcision that is far
 
03:12:49.309 --> 03:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
fewer than what Boston Children's
 
03:12:50.429 --> 03:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
Hospital says is the rate of
 
03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
complication of circumcision which is
 
03:12:56.389 --> 03:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
3% three out of 100 one out of
 
03:13:00.110 --> 03:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
33 so anyway with that I will end my
 
03:13:02.990 --> 03:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr chair thank you any
 
03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative kushman thank
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman representative read
 
03:13:08.670 --> 03:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm so used to getting off the
 
03:13:08.680 --> 03:13:09.469 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm so used to getting off the
hook

03:13:09.469 --> 03:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
hook
 
03:13:11.870 --> 03:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative um I I'll give you an
 
03:13:16.870 --> 03:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
easy one um are you aware of so just let
 
03:13:18.630 --> 03:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
me know if you follow here that if we
 
03:13:21.510 --> 03:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
take away the funding then um we've seen
 
03:13:22.910 --> 03:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
like in other states there will probably
 
03:13:26.550 --> 03:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
be a decrease demand um and are you
 
03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
aware of what happens to the prices in
 
03:13:31.190 --> 03:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
the private Market of of things when the
 
03:13:33.950 --> 03:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
demand decreases so this is a kind of
 
03:13:36.510 --> 03:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
common pra uh common problem rather not
 
03:13:39.550 --> 03:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
just in medicine with Medicaid but also
 
03:13:43.389 --> 03:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
in education uh where if you if you do
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
nothing else to control the market
 
03:13:47.309 --> 03:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
forces which I would say we should fund
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
these things not circumcision but fund
 
03:13:51.830 --> 03:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
Healthcare in general and fund education
 
03:13:53.229 --> 03:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
but that then you have to put
 
03:13:55.030 --> 03:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions in exchange for the public
 
03:13:56.670 --> 03:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
funds and the public trust being given
 
03:13:57.630 --> 03:13:57.640 align:start position:0%
towards that you have to put
 
03:13:59.429 --> 03:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
restrictions on what those private
 
03:14:01.110 --> 03:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
forces will do because what they will do
 
03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
is Rin seeking behavior and they will up
 
03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
the price if it's being paid for by the
 
03:14:07.510 --> 03:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
government they're going to take as much
 
03:14:08.910 --> 03:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
government money as they want so when
 
03:14:11.469 --> 03:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
you re unfortunately when you remove
 
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
those that the benefit of removing the
 
03:14:16.150 --> 03:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
funding is that the price comes down I
 
03:14:18.190 --> 03:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
would like to see everybody have medical
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
care but automatic circumcisions is not
 
03:14:23.070 --> 03:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
medical care so
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
that so that could potentially be a
 
03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
benefit for those people maybe who don't
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for Medicaid or even the people
 
03:14:31.870 --> 03:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
who do qualify for Medicaid but they're
 
03:14:34.229 --> 03:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
having trouble maybe affording that that
 
03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
the price will come down it'll be
 
03:14:37.990 --> 03:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
probably more easily accessible for I I
 
03:14:39.550 --> 03:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
do believe that eventually the market
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
forces would come down if this wasn't
 
03:14:42.910 --> 03:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
being covered by med Medicaid so that it
 
03:14:44.510 --> 03:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
would be more accessible I can't say it
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
would be accessible to everybody but I
 
03:14:47.950 --> 03:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
don't know that I want automatic maming
 
03:14:50.510 --> 03:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
of babies to be
 
03:14:54.150 --> 03:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
accessible other questions okay s on
 
03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:56.309 align:start position:0%
accessible other questions okay s on
thank

03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
03:15:10.990 --> 03:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:13.750 --> 03:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
Penza I don't know if I can follow up
 
03:15:16.590 --> 03:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
that so I'm just here in strong support
 
03:15:19.309 --> 03:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill um for a multitude of
 
03:15:22.510 --> 03:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
reasons but I think we have to be clear
 
03:15:25.710 --> 03:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
not medically necessary elective
 
03:15:28.189 --> 03:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
procedure so that's why would we all be
 
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
forced to pay for something and if
 
03:15:30.720 --> 03:15:32.349 align:start position:0%
forced to pay for something and if
there's

03:15:32.349 --> 03:15:32.359 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
education if someone still wants it
 
03:15:37.269 --> 03:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
after being provide the informed consent
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
and the necessary education that's
 
03:15:42.670 --> 03:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
needed then fi I I think finding the
 
03:15:45.189 --> 03:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
funding or finding the funds to do so
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
won't be very difficult so that's pretty
 
03:15:51.710 --> 03:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
much all I have to say it's elective not
 
03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:53.030 align:start position:0%
much all I have to say it's elective not
medically

03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
medically
 
03:15:55.590 --> 03:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
necessary so we shouldn't have it
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be paid for it it just like
 
03:15:59.309 --> 03:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
anything else that you're you're going
 
03:16:04.229 --> 03:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
to decide to do that is um not you know
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
plastic surgery anything like that those
 
03:16:08.030 --> 03:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
are things that have to come out of your
 
03:16:10.830 --> 03:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
own pocket unless and there's lots of
 
03:16:12.349 --> 03:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
exceptions in here which I think the
 
03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
might be some other ones um that are
 
03:16:17.070 --> 03:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
added in here that are amended in here
 
03:16:19.309 --> 03:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
um and from what the previous speaker
 
03:16:21.710 --> 03:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
talked about too
 
03:16:25.870 --> 03:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
um the gentleman uh I think that I think
 
03:16:27.990 --> 03:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
that it's pretty clear that this bill U
 
03:16:30.830 --> 03:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense uh 17 States is another
 
03:16:33.070 --> 03:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
thing too um we can look at all of that
 
03:16:34.229 --> 03:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
that's been
 
03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
implemented uh and yeah education is key
 
03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
people need to be that needs to be
 
03:16:41.950 --> 03:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
informed to consent in education and
 
03:16:43.309 --> 03:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
it's just just really important that I
 
03:16:45.950 --> 03:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
think um we move forward with these
 
03:16:47.790 --> 03:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
03:16:52.510 --> 03:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:55.469 --> 03:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak are Andrew
 
03:16:57.630 --> 03:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
Sheffer and Zoe
 
03:16:59.870 --> 03:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
Fowler um I can give you each three
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
minutes you've asked for 10 to 1550 and
 
03:17:03.870 --> 03:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
I can't do that that's understandable
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
sir three minutes a piece oh we're up to
 
03:17:07.910 --> 03:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
three minutes a
 
03:17:10.750 --> 03:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
piece so again I would like to apologize
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
in case there's any new faces here I do
 
03:17:15.550 --> 03:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
have a bit of a stutter and a twitch
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's something I've had for a long time
 
03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
might take me a couple seconds longer
 
03:17:21.670 --> 03:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
than three minutes do my best to keep
 
03:17:23.950 --> 03:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
concise um so I'm here I'm sorry
 
03:17:23.960 --> 03:17:26.590 align:start position:0%
concise um so I'm here I'm sorry
representative

03:17:26.590 --> 03:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:17:29.110 --> 03:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
Weber you got put little could you just
 
03:17:30.670 --> 03:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
speak a little closer into your
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
microphone because as you can see it it
 
03:17:36.349 --> 03:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
really does change the volume and it it
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
helps not only for us here in the room
 
03:17:40.150 --> 03:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
but for anybody who's following along at
 
03:17:42.910 --> 03:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
home of so thank you of course um so
 
03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
again I would like to apologize I have a
 
03:17:46.950 --> 03:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
stutter uh boiler play
 
03:17:50.750 --> 03:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
disclaimer um so one of the reasons I'm
 
03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
here to support uh House Bill uh
 
03:17:58.349 --> 03:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
1683 is because again like with
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
the the giving education I I feel this
 
03:18:06.229 --> 03:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
is another side of of a coin here
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
providing education
 
03:18:12.189 --> 03:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
and you know not using public resources
 
03:18:14.110 --> 03:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
that should be going towards treating
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
sick people that should be going going
 
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
towards you know people who have you
 
03:18:22.349 --> 03:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
know medical emergencies we're wasting
 
03:18:26.349 --> 03:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
resources on circumcising people when
 
03:18:28.389 --> 03:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
most of the time unless for the you know
 
03:18:31.150 --> 03:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
for certain medical issues if if they
 
03:18:34.070 --> 03:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
have a medical reason understandable
 
03:18:36.830 --> 03:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's completely you know that that's
 
03:18:40.510 --> 03:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable but otherwise I don't feel
 
03:18:42.990 --> 03:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to be spending American
 
03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:44.269 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to be spending American
taxpayers

03:18:44.269 --> 03:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
03:18:50.910 --> 03:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
dollars um on a unnecessary and very
 
03:18:52.750 --> 03:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
damaging uh
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:01.469 --> 03:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
that I
 
03:19:05.510 --> 03:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
apologize I also I also feel sorry I
 
03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
also feel that having Medicaid as a as a
 
03:19:12.189 --> 03:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
method of obtaining a circumcision
 
03:19:14.950 --> 03:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
encourages people I feel I'm someone who
 
03:19:17.429 --> 03:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
lives in poverty right now I've heard
 
03:19:19.469 --> 03:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
that it's a mark of poverty I'm not
 
03:19:21.550 --> 03:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
making much money right now I'm on
 
03:19:25.389 --> 03:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
disability and I still have no desire or
 
03:19:25.399 --> 03:19:26.550 align:start position:0%
disability and I still have no desire or
anything

03:19:26.550 --> 03:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:19:29.790 --> 03:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
to to go get circumcised I feel that
 
03:19:32.469 --> 03:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
objectively it is a harmful medical
 
03:19:36.429 --> 03:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
procedure that is a drain on our
 
03:19:36.439 --> 03:19:39.070 align:start position:0%
procedure that is a drain on our
resources

03:19:39.070 --> 03:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
resources
 
03:19:41.870 --> 03:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and I I apologize my stutter is kind
 
03:19:43.349 --> 03:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
of of acting up right now so I'm going
 
03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
to um resign myself at this point unless
 
03:19:50.349 --> 03:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
you have any questions for me sure does
 
03:19:53.590 --> 03:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
the other gentleman wish to speak
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
or the idea that uh State medical
 
03:19:59.469 --> 03:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
insurance should pay for circumcision to
 
03:20:03.070 --> 03:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
me would seem uh at best fanciful
 
03:20:06.030 --> 03:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
because any benefit to the procedure
 
03:20:07.790 --> 03:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
could just as easily be rendered as an
 
03:20:09.990 --> 03:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
adult as it could as a baby it is not a
 
03:20:12.229 --> 03:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
mark of poverty to have a forkin any
 
03:20:13.950 --> 03:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
more than it is a mark of poverty to
 
03:20:16.630 --> 03:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
have any health condition that is later
 
03:20:18.870 --> 03:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
fixed we do not perform open heart
 
03:20:22.389 --> 03:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
surgery on babies even if we uh or
 
03:20:24.429 --> 03:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
rather we do only in the instance that
 
03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
we can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
 
03:20:27.790 --> 03:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
that they cannot
 
03:20:31.389 --> 03:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
wait okay thank you are there any
 
03:20:33.550 --> 03:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
questions from committee
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
members I'm seeing none thank you very
 
03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
much all right thank you so much thank
 
03:20:44.349 --> 03:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:55.870 --> 03:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:58.510 --> 03:20:58.520 align:start position:0%

Brewster um I will keep this short as to
 
03:21:02.990 --> 03:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
not completely be a dead horse um I
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
would like to speak in favor of this
 
03:21:07.510 --> 03:21:07.520 align:start position:0%

bill to be passed to help reduce adverse
 
03:21:15.550 --> 03:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
outcomes of unnecessary circumcisions
 
03:21:18.349 --> 03:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
ideally in doing so reserving funds for
 
03:21:20.590 --> 03:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
medically necessitated
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%

won't count that time against
 
03:21:58.439 --> 03:22:10.750 align:start position:0%
won't count that time against
you

03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:10.760 --> 03:22:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
TR

03:22:16.750 --> 03:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay on HB 1683 I ask for your support
 
03:22:21.389 --> 03:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
on this bill because we should not use
 
03:22:24.110 --> 03:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
public resources to encourage medically
 
03:22:26.670 --> 03:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary surgery that also violates a
 
03:22:29.070 --> 03:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
child's bodily autonomy we shouldn't
 
03:22:30.990 --> 03:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
give Health Care Systems Financial
 
03:22:32.710 --> 03:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
incentives that can lead them to
 
03:22:35.429 --> 03:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
pressure parents for a needless surgery
 
03:22:38.349 --> 03:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
just being born male is not a
 
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
diagnosis I'm also concerned with the
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
surge of Latino immigration because
 
03:22:45.229 --> 03:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
foreign born Latinos are almost
 
03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
universally intact and their cultural
 
03:22:50.670 --> 03:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
practices may come under pressure to do
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
things the American
 
03:22:55.150 --> 03:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
way and they may be coerced to
 
03:22:56.950 --> 03:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
circumcise the children which may be
 
03:22:59.990 --> 03:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
presented to them is a free service and
 
03:23:02.950 --> 03:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
when I hear you know talk about that
 
03:23:05.710 --> 03:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
circumcision or being intact is is a
 
03:23:10.110 --> 03:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
stigma or Mark of poverty well Latinos
 
03:23:12.269 --> 03:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
not that they're in poverty but but uh
 
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
immigrants are almost universally intact
 
03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
and they don't seem to have a problem
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
with it so why do we have a problem with
 
03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
it someone brought up what if there's a
 
03:23:24.229 --> 03:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
history of family fimosis I've never
 
03:23:25.870 --> 03:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
read anything in the medical literature
 
03:23:29.229 --> 03:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
about familial fosis or being used to
 
03:23:31.389 --> 03:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
justify circumcision of birth to preempt
 
03:23:35.150 --> 03:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
an adult condition fimosis can be caused
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
by improper care as a baby such as by
 
03:23:39.710 --> 03:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
force retraction which we've heard about
 
03:23:41.070 --> 03:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
and there are minimally invasive
 
03:23:43.189 --> 03:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
treatments such which as steroid creams
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
that can address this if it's diagnosed
 
03:23:47.830 --> 03:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
as an adult when I reviewed the fiscal
 
03:23:49.550 --> 03:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
note I noticed it did not take into
 
03:23:51.510 --> 03:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
account the cost of circumcision
 
03:23:54.110 --> 03:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
complications or the additional savings
 
03:23:55.870 --> 03:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
that would be realized if this bill
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
passes referencing a study I supplied to
 
03:24:00.750 --> 03:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
you on page three the complication rate
 
03:24:03.790 --> 03:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
for circumcision was placed at
 
03:24:06.910 --> 03:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
11% okay so these complications will
 
03:24:08.830 --> 03:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
require the services of pediatric
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
urologist surgeon in a hospital setting
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
which is very ly so the fiscal note and
 
03:24:15.710 --> 03:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
per my exhibit page four should really
 
03:24:18.189 --> 03:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
include these course savings passed on
 
03:24:20.710 --> 03:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
all this pain suffering and Trauma being
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
inflicted on babies and taxpayers for no
 
03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.630 --> 03:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
this public fund should be used should
 
03:24:33.790 --> 03:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
not be used to promote violating bodily
 
03:24:36.309 --> 03:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
autonomy the public sector should set
 
03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
the standard for placing autonomy
 
03:24:42.550 --> 03:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
first I I think we should all live up to
 
03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
the motto of New Hampshire to live free
 
03:24:46.229 --> 03:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
let's have the next generation of
 
03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
children live free as natural normal and
 
03:24:52.189 --> 03:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
healthy intact people because that's
 
03:24:55.510 --> 03:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
what they are they're people I urge you
 
03:24:56.950 --> 03:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
to think about the future and how we
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:03.070 --> 03:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
children any questions thank you uh yeah
 
03:25:03.080 --> 03:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
children any questions thank you uh yeah
any

03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:25:09.349 --> 03:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:19.110 --> 03:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:22.030 --> 03:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
param welcome back thank you very much
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
and I only ask for a minute I wanted to
 
03:25:26.670 --> 03:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
basically say that I was very confused
 
03:25:29.429 --> 03:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
by previous testimony on how uh it's
 
03:25:31.349 --> 03:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
going to be so difficult to explain to
 
03:25:34.030 --> 03:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
poor people what's happening to them um
 
03:25:37.469 --> 03:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
I represent for 3% of doctors look like
 
03:25:40.110 --> 03:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
me black and female and consequently
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
when you talk about poverty I want you
 
03:25:45.070 --> 03:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
to also think about bipac issues here
 
03:25:46.630 --> 03:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
because there's a whole issue of how
 
03:25:49.630 --> 03:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
unfair our medical system is for all of
 
03:25:52.990 --> 03:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
us and it's across the class ladder so
 
03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
right now I would like no coverage not
 
03:25:58.110 --> 03:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
from the Republican fiscal
 
03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility end but from the
 
03:26:02.469 --> 03:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
complications and the fact that when the
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
mom goes back maybe she won't have
 
03:26:06.510 --> 03:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
people listen to her because she's poor
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
because that is a piece of this and then
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
the last thing I wanted to say was there
 
03:26:13.189 --> 03:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
are incentives for doctors to do things
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
I lived with them all the time so I
 
03:26:16.830 --> 03:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
understand some people didn't feel that
 
03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
but under Managed Care yes there are
 
03:26:22.030 --> 03:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
incentives to do things that may not be
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh exactly 100% of what you want to do
 
03:26:28.150 --> 03:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
morally thank you thank you any
 
03:26:33.630 --> 03:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.399 --> 03:26:43.790 align:start position:0%
 
Atkinson

03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
and again you you asked for four minutes
 
03:26:51.030 --> 03:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:52.750 --> 03:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
three good
 
03:26:55.110 --> 03:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
morning I also was puzzled by the
 
03:26:58.830 --> 03:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony uh about poverty uh
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
because I have spent the the past 10
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
years uh spreading foreskin awareness
 
03:27:06.429 --> 03:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
around the US and speaking with people
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
on the street in many different
 
03:27:10.349 --> 03:27:10.359 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods rich people and poor
 
03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
people and
 
03:27:14.269 --> 03:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
for people are intelligent and they
 
03:27:15.630 --> 03:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
understand the structure and function of
 
03:27:16.990 --> 03:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
the human foreskin and they understand
 
03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:18.070 align:start position:0%
the human foreskin and they understand
human

03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
human
 
03:27:21.269 --> 03:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
rights I will now read my prepared
 
03:27:23.229 --> 03:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
statement should be your choice how much
 
03:27:25.309 --> 03:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
of your genitals you get to
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
keep the question before us now is
 
03:27:28.950 --> 03:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire Medicaid dollars
 
03:27:31.950 --> 03:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
should be used to fund human rights
 
03:27:33.950 --> 03:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
violations last time New Hampshire
 
03:27:35.710 --> 03:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
considered this issue in 2015 opponents
 
03:27:37.189 --> 03:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
argued the passage of such a bill would
 
03:27:39.030 --> 03:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
result in fewer services to low-income
 
03:27:41.550 --> 03:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
residents providing services to low in
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
Residence is certainly a worthy goal
 
03:27:46.950 --> 03:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
therefore let me be clear getting part
 
03:27:48.750 --> 03:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
of your penis cut off without your
 
03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
consent is not a service it is an act of
 
03:27:55.189 --> 03:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
theft and violence despite the good
 
03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
intentions of the people who carry out
 
03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
this act the newborn child experiences
 
03:28:00.670 --> 03:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
trauma and betrayal when he only wants
 
03:28:02.349 --> 03:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
to bond peacefully with his
 
03:28:04.670 --> 03:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
mother it makes no difference whether
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
the person who cut my penis intended to
 
03:28:09.550 --> 03:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
hurt or to help the result is the same
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
also parenthetically I heard people
 
03:28:17.670 --> 03:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
talking about pain and I would say that
 
03:28:19.429 --> 03:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
even if foreskin amputation could be
 
03:28:21.309 --> 03:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
accomplished without torturing the child
 
03:28:23.550 --> 03:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
it would still be a human rights
 
03:28:25.710 --> 03:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
violation the children of Medicaid
 
03:28:28.150 --> 03:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
recipients like all children deserve the
 
03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reach adulthood with
 
03:28:32.750 --> 03:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
intact genitals the best way to serve
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
them is to leave their genitals alone to
 
03:28:34.800 --> 03:28:36.349 align:start position:0%
them is to leave their genitals alone to
develop

03:28:36.349 --> 03:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
develop
 
03:28:39.670 --> 03:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
normally we also heard uh briefly about
 
03:28:41.550 --> 03:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics whose
 
03:28:43.309 --> 03:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
2012 statement expired in
 
03:28:46.189 --> 03:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
2017 more recently in December 2022 the
 
03:28:48.349 --> 03:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
AAP published a patient education
 
03:28:49.870 --> 03:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
document regarding care of the intact
 
03:28:52.910 --> 03:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
penis which includes the text quote at
 
03:28:54.830 --> 03:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
Birth the forkin is is attached to the
 
03:28:56.990 --> 03:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
head of the penis until the forkin fully
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
separates it shouldn't be pulled back
 
03:28:59.870 --> 03:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
forcing the force skin to retract before
 
03:29:01.229 --> 03:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
it is ready can cause severe pain
 
03:29:03.910 --> 03:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
bleeding and tears in the skin end quote
 
03:29:05.670 --> 03:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
since premature forcible forkin
 
03:29:08.229 --> 03:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
retraction such as that is the first
 
03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
step of neonatal foreskin amputation it
 
03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
seems clear that the a has quietly
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
retreated from prior support of this
 
03:29:17.389 --> 03:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
practice the state should not condone
 
03:29:19.950 --> 03:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
let alone reimburse an activity that
 
03:29:22.189 --> 03:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
harms children particularly low-income
 
03:29:24.429 --> 03:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
children and that is contrary to Modern
 
03:29:27.150 --> 03:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
medical evidence and advice passage of
 
03:29:28.910 --> 03:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
this bill HB
 
03:29:31.389 --> 03:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
1683 will curtail wasteful government
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
spending prevent numerous human rights
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
violations and reduce the suffering of
 
03:29:36.950 --> 03:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
baby boys and the men they will become
 
03:29:42.349 --> 03:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions
 
03:29:42.359 --> 03:29:45.349 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions

03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:52.510 --> 03:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:55.269 --> 03:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
Goodwin I think he's going okay Mr
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
Goodwin's not here okay well moving on
 
03:30:04.070 --> 03:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:06.510 --> 03:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
lellan and again sir you put found five
 
03:30:08.830 --> 03:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
minutes please keep it to three thank
 
03:30:10.469 --> 03:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
you very much David lwell and as I
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
previously done ify myself I'm a lawyer
 
03:30:16.229 --> 03:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
who's spent the last 28 29 years dealing
 
03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
with circumcision issues I support this
 
03:30:24.309 --> 03:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
um uh this house bill
 
03:30:28.469 --> 03:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
1683 first Medicaid by federal statute
 
03:30:31.750 --> 03:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
is only allowed to pay for medical
 
03:30:34.349 --> 03:30:34.359 align:start position:0%
medically necessary procedures now that
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
is often the determination of that's
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
often left to the state but it is clear
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
that circum neonatal circum decision is
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
not medically necessary therefore abono
 
03:30:46.189 --> 03:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
this bill should be a no-brainer it
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
should not be permitted to be done
 
03:30:51.070 --> 03:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
unless there is a medical diagnosis that
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
is that is uh that requires it I will
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
address very briefly
 
03:30:59.189 --> 03:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
fimosis uh the the former representative
 
03:31:00.830 --> 03:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
who testified about his unfortunate
 
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
family history unfortunately what I
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
heard was burning cracking difficulty
 
03:31:08.189 --> 03:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
retracting the foreskin in an adult or
 
03:31:11.309 --> 03:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
at least in a teenager almost always and
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
his dad during the war almost always
 
03:31:16.990 --> 03:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's caused by yeast infections I've
 
03:31:19.870 --> 03:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
represented several adults who had
 
03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
circumcisions or re circumcisions who
 
03:31:25.870 --> 03:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
actually had a yeast infection never
 
03:31:28.790 --> 03:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
diagnosed by the urologist and diagnosed
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
afterwards either pathologically or
 
03:31:32.990 --> 03:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise I even had a Rec circumcision
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
in South Carolina where the guy still
 
03:31:37.349 --> 03:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
the the gentleman still had the yeast
 
03:31:38.710 --> 03:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
infection I had to send him to a
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
urologist who knew what he was doing
 
03:31:43.150 --> 03:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
you have to be careful about ever
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
including fimosis as a reason for
 
03:31:48.110 --> 03:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
circumcision unless it is after puberty
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
because otherwise they will just say
 
03:31:51.950 --> 03:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
congenital fimosis I see that diagnosis
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
all the time and that is essentially a
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
medical fraud all children generally
 
03:32:01.389 --> 03:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
have fimosis at Birth um it also can be
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
corrected by other than circumcision
 
03:32:05.389 --> 03:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
there are other surgeries that can be
 
03:32:07.830 --> 03:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
done Z plasties Bier flaps and the like
 
03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
I won't bore you with it but it's really
 
03:32:14.070 --> 03:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
not necessary to include that um as far
 
03:32:17.870 --> 03:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
as the uh uh the the state really should
 
03:32:20.590 --> 03:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
not be providing an opportunity for
 
03:32:23.070 --> 03:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
cosmetic surgery and unnecessary surgery
 
03:32:26.910 --> 03:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
what they which they do by um uh by
 
03:32:30.229 --> 03:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
funding this uh in regard to economic
 
03:32:31.710 --> 03:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
considerations is actually in the
 
03:32:33.630 --> 03:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
literature that a doctor has said every
 
03:32:36.269 --> 03:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
baby boy is born with a coupon for
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
$125 on his penis so is this is this uh
 
03:32:43.349 --> 03:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh actually encourag because it's
 
03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursed absolutely uh I would address
 
03:32:47.790 --> 03:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
the whole question of of equity I
 
03:32:49.950 --> 03:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
believe in Medicaid I believe that we
 
03:32:51.510 --> 03:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
ought to be providing things we don't
 
03:32:53.790 --> 03:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
provide eyeglasses for example I think
 
03:32:56.229 --> 03:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
in this state you do provide uh dental
 
03:32:58.349 --> 03:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
care we don't in Georgia we ought to be
 
03:33:00.030 --> 03:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
but we ought not to be wasting the
 
03:33:02.429 --> 03:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
Public's money so I approach this not
 
03:33:04.189 --> 03:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
from a Republican or Democratic
 
03:33:06.550 --> 03:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
perspective but from a perspective that
 
03:33:08.309 --> 03:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
yes the poor should be covered but we
 
03:33:10.429 --> 03:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
should only be doing necessary things
 
03:33:14.030 --> 03:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
with public funds in regard to being
 
03:33:15.670 --> 03:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
marked with poverty my foreskin is never
 
03:33:17.389 --> 03:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
marked me as being poor and I'm not
 
03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
exactly the richest lawyer in the world
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
but I'm not poor and nobody's ever said
 
03:33:24.189 --> 03:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
I was because I have a forkin Hispanics
 
03:33:25.950 --> 03:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
generally don't circumcise and they make
 
03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
up a large percentage in Most states of
 
03:33:31.510 --> 03:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
the population uh on Medicaid so I think
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
you would find if it weren't encouraged
 
03:33:34.830 --> 03:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
you could please start wrapping up Sir
 
03:33:37.710 --> 03:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
yeah anyway I think that it's very clear
 
03:33:40.150 --> 03:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
in in essence that it is not medically
 
03:33:41.469 --> 03:33:41.479 align:start position:0%
necessary that therefore it should not
 
03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
be covered I would change the bill a
 
03:33:45.790 --> 03:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
little bit I would add some things to me
 
03:33:48.030 --> 03:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
for medically necessary circumcisions
 
03:33:50.670 --> 03:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
such as penal tortion hypospadius
 
03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
epispadias other congenital malformation
 
03:33:56.070 --> 03:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
of the penis that um or foreskin that
 
03:33:58.349 --> 03:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
requires uh removal of all of the part
 
03:34:00.630 --> 03:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
of the foreskin for correction I would
 
03:34:03.389 --> 03:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
add those and I would add to under uh on
 
03:34:07.150 --> 03:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
line three uh item three or line 13
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
rather I would add uh in place of
 
03:34:10.990 --> 03:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
recurrent urinary tract infection which
 
03:34:12.150 --> 03:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
you really aren't going to be able to
 
03:34:14.590 --> 03:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
determine under the age of one I would
 
03:34:17.309 --> 03:34:17.319 align:start position:0%
change that to congenital cord D which
 
03:34:19.229 --> 03:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
is a congenital Bend of the penis which
 
03:34:22.389 --> 03:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
may require correction early uh those
 
03:34:23.790 --> 03:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
are changes that I would make to the
 
03:34:27.870 --> 03:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
bill if I had um a choice in the matter
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any questions I'll be
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them any
 
03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you sir thank you
 
03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
very much I I do want to say I am
 
03:34:37.990 --> 03:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
impressed by the fact that their public
 
03:34:39.750 --> 03:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
hearings and the attentiveness of
 
03:34:41.229 --> 03:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
everyone here in New hampsh Hampshire
 
03:34:43.229 --> 03:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
makes me proud to be what a grandchild
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I guess but it makes me
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
very proud thank you very much thank you
 
03:34:53.710 --> 03:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:56.150 --> 03:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
comment also signed up to speak is
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
America

03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
and and again you asked for four minutes
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
try to keep it to three please I will do
 
03:35:25.710 --> 03:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you uh again my credentials
 
03:35:27.790 --> 03:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
are on record uh both in writing and for
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
my prior testimony but I will emphasize
 
03:35:31.830 --> 03:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
that I ran a nonprofit Medicaid managed
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
care plan in New York state for 25 years
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I support um House Bill 1683 FN
 
03:35:43.309 --> 03:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid's a lifesaver for low-income
 
03:35:45.429 --> 03:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
families Working Families the elderly
 
03:35:47.429 --> 03:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
and the disabled but Medicaid resources
 
03:35:49.870 --> 03:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
are finite that's why Medicaid's
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
standard for coverage is medical
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
necessity some who oppose discontinuing
 
03:35:58.510 --> 03:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage of circumcisions argue
 
03:36:00.349 --> 03:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
that doing so deprives poor children of
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
a benefit that wealthier children that
 
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
wealthier families are able to afford
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
the opposite is
 
03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
true circumcision covers circumcision
 
03:36:13.830 --> 03:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
confers no benefit on any boy or the man
 
03:36:16.030 --> 03:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
he will become it only benefits the
 
03:36:18.269 --> 03:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
medical professionals and Facilities who
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
can bill and collect for the procedure
 
03:36:21.990 --> 03:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
and those who make their livings from
 
03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
prep from repairing the damage that's
 
03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
why the American Academy of Pediatrics
 
03:36:29.830 --> 03:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
continues to push for Medicaid coverage
 
03:36:29.840 --> 03:36:30.830 align:start position:0%
continues to push for Medicaid coverage
of

03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:36:33.150 --> 03:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
circumcision I'm going to depart from
 
03:36:35.189 --> 03:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
some of the prior testimony the tone of
 
03:36:37.710 --> 03:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
it and talk about my son my son is 43
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
years old he was born in 1980 when he
 
03:36:44.110 --> 03:36:44.120 align:start position:0%
asked his dad and me um he got into
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
school only a couple of boys look like
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
me how come I'm not circumcised and we
 
03:36:53.070 --> 03:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
told him you're one of the lucky ones
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
you have the body parts that you were
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
born with that God or nature intended
 
03:37:01.110 --> 03:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
you to have and you should while not
 
03:37:03.429 --> 03:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
holding that over other boys you should
 
03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
be happy you should be proud and indeed
 
03:37:09.550 --> 03:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
when he was 18 he thanked us he said you
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
know I never thanked you and Dad I asked
 
03:37:12.670 --> 03:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
you a question I never thanked you and
 
03:37:15.469 --> 03:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
Dad for not having me circumcised but I
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
really want to thank you I can only
 
03:37:20.710 --> 03:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
imagine um what pleasure his foreskin
 
03:37:22.990 --> 03:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
was giving him at that time that came
 
03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
that brought him to that point but most
 
03:37:31.349 --> 03:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
boys all boys should be able to have
 
03:37:35.790 --> 03:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
what my son has which is his entire body
 
03:37:37.910 --> 03:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to just briefly go through
 
03:37:39.670 --> 03:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
the bioethics of circumcision because
 
03:37:41.070 --> 03:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
other people have I've mentioned it
 
03:37:42.870 --> 03:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
it'll take a
 
03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
moment neonatal circumcision violates
 
03:37:50.750 --> 03:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
every basic principle of medical
 
03:37:53.950 --> 03:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
ethics autonomy means that individuals
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
have the right to choose for themselves
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
what to do with their own bodies doesn't
 
03:37:59.670 --> 03:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
mean the parents it doesn't mean the
 
03:38:03.070 --> 03:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
doctors it doesn't mean state taxpayers
 
03:38:06.349 --> 03:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
or State Medicaid individuals have the
 
03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
right to choose what they do with their
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
own bodies benevolence is the principle
 
03:38:14.670 --> 03:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
that doctors should add act in their
 
03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
patients best interests and treat them
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
with kindness and compassion permanently
 
03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
removing healthy normal genitalia from a
 
03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
baby often with inadequate or even no
 
03:38:27.070 --> 03:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
pain relief clearly violates the
 
03:38:29.870 --> 03:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
principle of benevolence non-maleficence
 
03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
you're all familiar with it it is best
 
03:38:34.870 --> 03:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
expressed with a hypocritic oath with
 
03:38:37.710 --> 03:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
which you're all familiar first Do no
 
03:38:41.070 --> 03:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
harm removing a healthy body part
 
03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
creates harm finally Justice is a
 
03:38:46.910 --> 03:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
particularly important principle to
 
03:38:49.110 --> 03:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
apply in the context of routine male
 
03:38:52.510 --> 03:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision in the US girls are rightly
 
03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
protected from Force surgery on their
 
03:38:56.469 --> 03:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
genitals boys are entitled to the same
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
protection to do otherwise violates the
 
03:39:02.309 --> 03:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
bio bioethical principle of Justice in
 
03:39:05.349 --> 03:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
some again infant circumcision violates
 
03:39:07.950 --> 03:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
all of the principles of bioethical all
 
03:39:10.590 --> 03:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
the bioethical principles of Justice
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
autonomy non-maleficence and beneficence
 
03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
by calling for an antim medically
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
unnecessary penis surgery this committee
 
03:39:19.630 --> 03:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
is doing a service to all New Hampshire
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
residents and to the Future boys born in
 
03:39:24.510 --> 03:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
this state and the men they will become
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any
 
03:39:34.750 --> 03:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:37.670 --> 03:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Adrienne
 
03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:39.229 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Adrienne
so

03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:39.239 --> 03:39:48.269 align:start position:0%
so
sodi

03:39:48.269 --> 03:39:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:50.070 --> 03:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
again you have three minutes ma'am
 
03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:53.070 align:start position:0%
again you have three minutes ma'am
welcome

03:39:53.070 --> 03:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:55.710 --> 03:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
back yes so I'm Adrienne soti and I'm
 
03:39:59.070 --> 03:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
here to support um eliminating Medicaid
 
03:40:02.349 --> 03:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
funding of circumcision as uh you had
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
heard me before I had described how I
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
was given improper advice in um how to
 
03:40:10.990 --> 03:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
care for my intact son
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh which uh the American Medical
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
Association describes is exactly what
 
03:40:17.469 --> 03:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to do because you
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
will cause fosis many parents do not
 
03:40:25.269 --> 03:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
know that and therefore um falsely
 
03:40:27.990 --> 03:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
believe that that is a condition that
 
03:40:30.269 --> 03:40:30.279 align:start position:0%
may run in their families when in fact
 
03:40:31.830 --> 03:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps they're not getting proper
 
03:40:35.229 --> 03:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
Medical Care um there are alternative
 
03:40:37.469 --> 03:40:37.479 align:start position:0%
treatments as described earlier and
 
03:40:40.269 --> 03:40:40.279 align:start position:0%
number one there is um there are are
 
03:40:42.990 --> 03:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
steroid creams just like we women uh
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
often for weeks or months have issues
 
03:40:47.910 --> 03:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
with yeast infection men can have that
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
issue as well um the solution is not to
 
03:40:53.229 --> 03:40:53.239 align:start position:0%
remove their genital tissues just like
 
03:40:55.670 --> 03:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
we women do not have the coverage of our
 
03:40:57.870 --> 03:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
clitorises removed to eliminate that or
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
any other uh genital tissues removed we
 
03:41:03.510 --> 03:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
always revert to the most conservative
 
03:41:06.269 --> 03:41:06.279 align:start position:0%
treatment which is what should be done
 
03:41:09.309 --> 03:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
uh should be afforded to men as well um
 
03:41:12.670 --> 03:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
so that I would definitely not use as a
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
um an amendment to this bill and um one
 
03:41:18.910 --> 03:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why circumcision should
 
03:41:22.910 --> 03:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
not be um covered by Medicaid also is
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
the need for repeat corrective surgeries
 
03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
I have earlier handed out uh some uh
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
some papers um there was a study in M
 
03:41:34.590 --> 03:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts General Hospital um that
 
03:41:38.309 --> 03:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
said 7.4% of all visits to a pediatric
 
03:41:40.990 --> 03:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
urologist were for circumcision
 
03:41:43.269 --> 03:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
complications this translated to an
 
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
average total cost per patient for redo
 
03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
procedures of
 
03:41:51.110 --> 03:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
$1,617 and an estimate annual cost of $1
 
03:41:54.349 --> 03:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
137 to that Institution for a single
 
03:41:57.630 --> 03:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
Urologic provider at the hospital so
 
03:41:59.349 --> 03:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
that should be taken into consideration
 
03:42:02.309 --> 03:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
as well as uh what a Utah study shows um
 
03:42:04.229 --> 03:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
that there the
 
03:42:07.469 --> 03:42:07.479 align:start position:0%
complications of circumcision about
 
03:42:10.030 --> 03:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
11% um doctors opposing circumcision
 
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
Vision um state that the approximately
 
03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
the funds of uh saved would be 2,000 per
 
03:42:20.269 --> 03:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
child which include the original
 
03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
procedure and include later costs for
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up and surgical botch repairs and
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
it could be put to better use for actual
 
03:42:30.990 --> 03:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
pediatric medical needs in New Hampshire
 
03:42:34.510 --> 03:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
I also want to mention a very good uh
 
03:42:37.189 --> 03:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
Jewish friend of mine who is a lady in
 
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
New York who I contacted originally when
 
03:42:42.189 --> 03:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
I first was looking for information
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
about uh intac care and uh just
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
understanding circumcision circumcision
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
she run runs a an organization used to
 
03:42:53.950 --> 03:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
run no Circ New York uh National
 
03:42:56.950 --> 03:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
Organization of circumcision information
 
03:42:58.269 --> 03:42:58.279 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers and she's been
 
03:43:00.870 --> 03:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
educating people about this issue for 40
 
03:43:05.950 --> 03:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
years she is a Jewish lady who
 
03:43:08.910 --> 03:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
um does not believe in circumcision she
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
lives by The Motto first Do no harm and
 
03:43:14.710 --> 03:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
the Golden Rule she teaches her par uh
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
her parents to M M Massage their babies
 
03:43:19.870 --> 03:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
and ensure nurturing beginnings and does
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
not procedure not not support procedure
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
that inflicts pain and causes lifelong
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
psychological and physical harm which is
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what another representative uh
 
03:43:35.349 --> 03:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
suggested we would be saving those um
 
03:43:37.790 --> 03:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or poor Medicaid patients who
 
03:43:40.830 --> 03:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
are uh subjected to the Sur surgery so
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
that cannot be further from the truth um
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
remaining intact is the default State
 
03:43:52.229 --> 03:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
and uh it should be um normalized many
 
03:43:55.110 --> 03:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
insurance companies besides
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid also uh do not cover it so it
 
03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea to look into that
 
03:44:06.830 --> 03:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:23.429 --> 03:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
abov uh I uh simply don't think that
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
there's any place uh for taxpayer money
 
03:44:29.429 --> 03:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
to be used for child mutilation
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
under these For No Good Reason um also
 
03:44:36.030 --> 03:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
the idea that doctors are just angels
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
that do always uh always good is not
 
03:44:40.149 --> 03:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
true either they have a lot lot of
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
incentives and uh money is obviously one
 
03:44:43.439 --> 03:44:44.510 align:start position:0%
incentives and uh money is obviously one
of

03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:44:48.349 --> 03:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:48.359 --> 03:44:51.309 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:44:51.309 --> 03:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
okay and I have two cards here I believe
 
03:44:56.670 --> 03:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
they're from the same individual uh Rich
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
angel from Grafton from genital
 
03:45:03.309 --> 03:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
autonomy uh sir you've got should be one
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
card I've actually got two um one says
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
10 minutes one says 3 minutes 3 minutes
 
03:45:13.469 --> 03:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:17.550 --> 03:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
okay well somebody brought up uh mental
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
health um of parents and I just like to
 
03:45:23.309 --> 03:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
point out that the mental health of
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
children is what should come first and
 
03:45:28.110 --> 03:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to tell you a little a little
 
03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
story about that I the first Symposium I
 
03:45:32.349 --> 03:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
attended on the subject was a second
 
03:45:34.510 --> 03:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
International Symposium on circumcision
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
in San Francisco the second speaker was
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
Dr David Chamberlain who went on to um
 
03:45:44.429 --> 03:45:44.439 align:start position:0%
lead um birth psychology uh if you look
 
03:45:46.990 --> 03:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
up birth psychology.com I think it is
 
03:45:50.550 --> 03:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
or.org uh he wrote uh babies remember
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
their birth and uh and other birth uh
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
books on that subject and so anyway uh
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
after he spoke I uh I did the questions
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
and answers thing I I asked him Dr uh
 
03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
Chamberlain I found your book in the
 
03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
bookstore uh called babies remember
 
03:46:12.030 --> 03:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
their birth and I looked all the way
 
03:46:16.110 --> 03:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
through it and I didn't find anything on
 
03:46:19.149 --> 03:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
circumcision uh how did you overlook
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
that or or am I missing something he
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
said well thank you very much um
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
actually I wrote a burning chapter on
 
03:46:28.349 --> 03:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
circumcision and other procedures that
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
are done routinely on infants without
 
03:46:34.149 --> 03:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and the publisher refused to
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh publish the book with that chapter
 
03:46:40.950 --> 03:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
intact so I had to uh omit it and uh if
 
03:46:43.309 --> 03:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
you want to know more about the
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
psychological impact of infant
 
03:46:49.189 --> 03:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
circumcision uh look up uh doctors
 
03:46:51.630 --> 03:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
opposing circumcision.
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
org4 professionals you'll you'll find it
 
03:46:58.229 --> 03:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh just look for psychological impact
 
03:47:00.309 --> 03:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
and in case you think that doctor's
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
opposing circumcision is
 
03:47:07.389 --> 03:47:07.399 align:start position:0%
biased you are correct and their bias is
 
03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
Do no harm to two bodily autonomy for
 
03:47:14.110 --> 03:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
all three education and preventative
 
03:47:15.990 --> 03:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
care and
 
03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
four conservative treatment for the rare
 
03:47:21.830 --> 03:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
problems that do come up now and then
 
03:47:26.149 --> 03:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
usually because of uh iatrogenic uh care
 
03:47:28.149 --> 03:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
that is to say they um most of the
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
complications are iatrogenic in nature
 
03:47:32.189 --> 03:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
in the first
 
03:47:33.990 --> 03:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
place and with that I would like to
 
03:47:37.349 --> 03:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
yield the balance of my time to the next
 
03:47:41.630 --> 03:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.189 --> 03:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:47.389 --> 03:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
you actually there's no one else signed
 
03:47:50.429 --> 03:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
up to speak uh on hb1
 
03:47:52.750 --> 03:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
1683 um the blue sheet in the back
 
03:47:55.269 --> 03:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
indicates six people did sign up in
 
03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
favor of it and pleas signed up opposed
 
03:47:57.760 --> 03:47:58.510 align:start position:0%
favor of it and pleas signed up opposed
to

03:47:58.510 --> 03:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
it uh so with that I'm going to close
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
1683 as previously announced we're going
 
03:48:09.550 --> 03:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
to continue 1669 until later the
 
03:48:12.429 --> 03:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon till 300 p.m. uh it is after
 
03:48:16.030 --> 03:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
1:00 so we can move on to HB
 
03:48:19.269 --> 03:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
1194 and this time I will recognize the
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor who once again is
 
03:48:21.439 --> 03:48:23.189 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor who once again is
representative

03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
Phillips is actually is representative
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:41.070 --> 03:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon everybody I hope
 
03:48:42.990 --> 03:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
everyone got their lunch in um I'll be
 
03:48:47.750 --> 03:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
very quick this um Bill 1194 um just as
 
03:48:48.990 --> 03:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
a definition
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
correction to align with the idea that
 
03:48:54.750 --> 03:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines protect people from uh diseases
 
03:48:54.760 --> 03:48:55.429 align:start position:0%
vaccines protect people from uh diseases
that

03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
are uh pass personto person so the RSA
 
03:49:02.910 --> 03:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:06.309 --> 03:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
all well that's quick representative
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
Palmer so looking at the schedule that
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
sort of leaves out
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
tetus and I'm not quite sure why we
 
03:49:16.110 --> 03:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
would want to leave out tetus since it's
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
not communicable person to person but if
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
you get it I've seen somebody with
 
03:49:21.870 --> 03:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
tetnus and I never want to see that
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
again just a definition change what do
 
03:49:26.349 --> 03:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
you mean by leaving it
 
03:49:29.149 --> 03:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
out you mean on what what things can be
 
03:49:32.189 --> 03:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
mandated people can still choose tness
 
03:49:34.149 --> 03:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
yeah right but I'm not I'm just not
 
03:49:36.309 --> 03:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
quite sure then why we would change the
 
03:49:38.189 --> 03:49:38.199 align:start position:0%
language why we would have ail to change
 
03:49:40.149 --> 03:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
the language
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
if there's no other thing than it
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
changes the language uh representative
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
Parmer we're having trouble hearing you
 
03:49:48.030 --> 03:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
up here is this not working uh just move
 
03:49:50.670 --> 03:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
it move it closer even closer sorry I I
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
guess so since all of the most of the
 
03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
other diseases in there pneumonia is a
 
03:50:01.950 --> 03:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
little iffy but are infectious and
 
03:50:04.030 --> 03:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
transmitted person to person and I guess
 
03:50:06.630 --> 03:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
technically tetanus is really infectious
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
as well but it's not transmitted person
 
03:50:11.550 --> 03:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
to person but it's kind of a really key
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
thing to have
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated I'm not quite sure maybe you
 
03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
can explain to me better than I'm
 
03:50:19.710 --> 03:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
understanding the reason that we need a
 
03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
a language change if it doesn't really
 
03:50:21.680 --> 03:50:23.510 align:start position:0%
a language change if it doesn't really
change

03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:50:26.830 --> 03:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
anything I mean we're trying to I guess
 
03:50:28.030 --> 03:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
the vaccine is supposed to protect you
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
from Catching something from someone
 
03:50:31.950 --> 03:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
else right and tetanus cannot you cannot
 
03:50:35.550 --> 03:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.429 --> 03:50:38.439 align:start position:0%
being right but I wouldn't want somebody
 
03:50:41.590 --> 03:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
to opt out of of the tetus for some
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
reason and then get tetanus but if I'm
 
03:50:47.790 --> 03:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
just not understanding the the rationale
 
03:50:50.070 --> 03:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
for the bill I guess that's my I believe
 
03:50:52.990 --> 03:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
people can opt out of whatever they
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
want yes but why do we need to get rid
 
03:50:59.590 --> 03:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
infectious it's not transmissible I
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.309 --> 03:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
just representative kushman thank you Mr
 
03:51:11.710 --> 03:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you representative
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that the idea for
 
03:51:15.960 --> 03:51:17.469 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that the idea for
mandating

03:51:17.469 --> 03:51:17.479 align:start position:0%
mandating
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinations is that you are preventing
 
03:51:22.510 --> 03:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
something that can be transmissible
 
03:51:25.630 --> 03:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
between people and that is the only
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
scenario where the
 
03:51:30.830 --> 03:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
government asserts some kind of ability
 
03:51:35.110 --> 03:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
to do that um and that matters of
 
03:51:37.870 --> 03:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
diseases that are not transmissible are
 
03:51:40.710 --> 03:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
personal decisions where government has
 
03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
no authority to step
 
03:51:48.870 --> 03:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
in yes thank you follow up um are you
 
03:51:52.189 --> 03:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
aware of any tetanus vaccin vaccines
 
03:51:54.429 --> 03:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
available in the United States that
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't also include antigens for
 
03:52:00.030 --> 03:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases such as D theia
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
and uh protesis I'm not a medical
 
03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
professional but I'm not familiar I
 
03:52:06.910 --> 03:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
think they're all combos thank
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
03:52:12.110 --> 03:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions okay thank
 
03:52:16.750 --> 03:52:16.760 align:start position:0%

03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
today is Dr Ryan tanan who is a
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
registered pharmacist and the chief of
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of Infectious Disease Control
 
03:52:56.110 --> 03:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
and we are here to speak in opposition
 
03:52:57.710 --> 03:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
1194 um relative to this definition
 
03:53:03.389 --> 03:53:03.399 align:start position:0%
change which removes the word infectious
 
03:53:05.469 --> 03:53:05.479 align:start position:0%
from the current definition of non-c
 
03:53:08.189 --> 03:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
communic non-communicable disease in RSA
 
03:53:11.229 --> 03:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
141c uh as is already started to be
 
03:53:13.110 --> 03:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
discussed uh we believe this proposed
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
legislation is intended to prevent the
 
03:53:17.229 --> 03:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
department uh specifically from
 
03:53:20.110 --> 03:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
requiring um certain immunizations that
 
03:53:23.710 --> 03:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
are currently required under RSA 141c
 
03:53:26.229 --> 03:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
for entry into child care in schools
 
03:53:29.429 --> 03:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
specifically the tetanus vaccine um and
 
03:53:31.229 --> 03:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
combination vaccines which include
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
tetanus um all of the infectious
 
03:53:36.670 --> 03:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
diseases currently listed um under RSA
 
03:53:38.950 --> 03:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
141c for which the department current
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
currently requires vaccination for
 
03:53:43.389 --> 03:53:43.399 align:start position:0%
children in child care and schools are
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
spread personto person with the
 
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
exception of
 
03:53:50.710 --> 03:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
tetanus however um there is a conflict
 
03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
because the tetanus vaccine is not a
 
03:53:54.910 --> 03:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
standalone vaccine rather it's a vaccine
 
03:53:57.389 --> 03:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
that um is formulated in combination for
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
other diseases like diptheria um and
 
03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
pertusus which are also required
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
immunizations under RCA
 
03:54:10.750 --> 03:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
141c um therefore a child must receive a
 
03:54:12.149 --> 03:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
tetanus containing vaccine to be
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
immunized against dip theia and pressus
 
03:54:17.389 --> 03:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
which sets up a um conflict and a contra
 
03:54:19.630 --> 03:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
indication within the legislation said
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
should um House Bill one uh House Bill
 
03:54:26.790 --> 03:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
1194 pass um so we believe that um this
 
03:54:29.590 --> 03:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislation if adopted would prevent the
 
03:54:33.189 --> 03:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
department from requiring any vaccine
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
that contains tetanus including
 
03:54:37.630 --> 03:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
combination vaccines uh for some of
 
03:54:39.830 --> 03:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
these other important um communicable
 
03:54:43.269 --> 03:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
diseases so for that reason we oppose um
 
03:54:45.070 --> 03:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
any attempt to remove uh the
 
03:54:47.030 --> 03:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
Department's authority to require tetnus
 
03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh particularly if it
 
03:54:50.590 --> 03:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes requirements for other
 
03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases uh based on the
 
03:54:54.550 --> 03:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
currently available vaccine
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
formulations um we also want to make the
 
03:54:59.750 --> 03:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee aware that during the 2018
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
legislative session House Bill
 
03:55:05.950 --> 03:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
1367 was proposed relative to removing
 
03:55:08.070 --> 03:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
tetanus from the law requiring certain
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
immunization and that proposed
 
03:55:12.469 --> 03:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
legislation at that time was determined
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
by this uh committee to be inexpedient
 
03:55:17.630 --> 03:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
to legislate so in summary well it's
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
true that tetanus is not transmitted
 
03:55:22.910 --> 03:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
personto person we still recommend for
 
03:55:25.269 --> 03:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
um the reasons already highlighted uh
 
03:55:27.030 --> 03:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
that all all children and adults be
 
03:55:28.750 --> 03:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately immunized against this
 
03:55:31.590 --> 03:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
potentially deadly disease and we oppose
 
03:55:33.309 --> 03:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
legislation that would limit um the
 
03:55:34.710 --> 03:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
Department's authority to require
 
03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
certain vaccines that are safe and
 
03:55:38.030 --> 03:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
highly effective at preventing the
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
spread of disease and outbreaks in
 
03:55:42.870 --> 03:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
childcare in school settings um and with
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
that I will'll end our testimony and
 
03:55:45.870 --> 03:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you I think
 
03:55:48.030 --> 03:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's exactly three minutes that's
 
03:55:50.510 --> 03:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
excellent um you indicated on your pink
 
03:55:52.710 --> 03:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
card that you had written testimony you
 
03:55:55.510 --> 03:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
were going to submit is that correct yes
 
03:55:56.590 --> 03:55:56.600 align:start position:0%
and uh I thought we had already
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
submitted that oh okay I think it has
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
been submitted and I'll just I'll just
 
03:56:01.389 --> 03:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
also point out that there's actually
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
more information in that testimony
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
specific to tetanus um it's an uncommon
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
disease uh we certainly highly recommend
 
03:56:11.950 --> 03:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
that people um get vaccinated against it
 
03:56:13.429 --> 03:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
because even with modern medical care
 
03:56:15.229 --> 03:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
when people get tetanus it can be
 
03:56:18.510 --> 03:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
there's like a 10 to 20% fatality rate
 
03:56:20.990 --> 03:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
um because of how severe the infection
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
can be okay thank you Dr tanan did you
 
03:56:26.950 --> 03:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
want to say anything or uh are you just
 
03:56:29.149 --> 03:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
here for backup so to speak or just here
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
to assist if there's any questions thank
 
03:56:33.309 --> 03:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
you okay are there any questions
 
03:56:33.319 --> 03:56:34.990 align:start position:0%
you okay are there any questions
representative

03:56:34.990 --> 03:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
Weber so I'm wondering about about the
 
03:56:40.830 --> 03:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
effect of the language of removing that
 
03:56:44.030 --> 03:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
one word and being left only with the
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
personto person
 
03:56:50.790 --> 03:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
designation um when it's is am I correct
 
03:56:53.590 --> 03:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
in thinking that there are that that
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
might be a problem because there are
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
issues of transmission from um uh
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
animals to people or from um Less Direct
 
03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
contacts than personto person uh through
 
03:57:12.550 --> 03:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
F food or something like that or hot
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
tubs or other things I mean I know
 
03:57:16.990 --> 03:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
there's no vac for that but yeah
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you for that
 
03:57:20.910 --> 03:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
question um and and you're absolutely
 
03:57:23.469 --> 03:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
right tetanus is a disease that's
 
03:57:25.950 --> 03:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
transmitted through the environment you
 
03:57:30.149 --> 03:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
know this is a it's a toxin mediated
 
03:57:32.550 --> 03:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
disease where um somebody can get
 
03:57:34.590 --> 03:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
infected from the environment with
 
03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
spores at this bacteria the spores start
 
03:57:39.630 --> 03:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
germinating and reproducing in their
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
body it releases a toxin that causes um
 
03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
the disease tetanus so it's not
 
03:57:47.349 --> 03:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
transmitted personto person uh it's an
 
03:57:50.269 --> 03:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
environmentally acquired disease it's
 
03:57:52.710 --> 03:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
still an infectious disease right it's
 
03:57:54.429 --> 03:57:54.439 align:start position:0%
not transmitted person to person but it
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
is an infectious disease and hence
 
03:57:58.389 --> 03:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
removing the word infectious disease or
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
infectious from the definition would
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
specifically Target That
 
03:58:06.030 --> 03:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine followup sure and are there
 
03:58:08.630 --> 03:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
other roots of transmission like um
 
03:58:12.030 --> 03:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
through contact with an object or or
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
other other ways of transmission that
 
03:58:16.269 --> 03:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
are not strictly speaking personto
 
03:58:19.149 --> 03:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
person but through an intermediary of
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
some kind um so so tetanus is not a
 
03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
disease that somebody gets and then
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
passes along to somebody else through um
 
03:58:30.189 --> 03:58:30.199 align:start position:0%
the environment as through an
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
intermediate mechanism right this is a
 
03:58:34.149 --> 03:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
bacteria that's s in the soil um you
 
03:58:35.910 --> 03:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
know the classic example is somebody
 
03:58:38.670 --> 03:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
steps on a rusty nail for example and
 
03:58:40.750 --> 03:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
that Rusty Nails Bend in the environment
 
03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
it you know punctures the skin you know
 
03:58:46.510 --> 03:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
contaminating somebody's you know body
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
with the bacteria and the spores that
 
03:58:51.469 --> 03:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
then release the toxin uh into the body
 
03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
but it's not like somebody has it and
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
then passes it through the environment
 
03:58:57.309 --> 03:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
to somebody else it's just a bacteria
 
03:58:58.910 --> 03:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's everywhere currently in our
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
environment and hence the need for a
 
03:59:03.469 --> 03:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
routine and uh periodic boosting uh with
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
a tetanus
 
03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine repr Murphy thank you Mr
 
03:59:10.110 --> 03:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
question um this a simple question I
 
03:59:14.149 --> 03:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
guess and I should know this but the
 
03:59:16.429 --> 03:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
mortality rate for unvaccinated patient
 
03:59:18.830 --> 03:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
03:59:18.840 --> 03:59:20.710 align:start position:0%
uh from
tetnus

03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
tetnus
 
03:59:24.630 --> 03:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think uh so so the
 
03:59:28.110 --> 03:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine is probably near 100% effective
 
03:59:30.710 --> 03:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
right so if somebody gets tetanus
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's almost always I don't you know
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
nothing's ever 100% it's almost always
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
in somebody that's unvaccinated or is
 
03:59:40.030 --> 03:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
not up to date on their
 
03:59:42.389 --> 03:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
vaccination and so when tetanus does
 
03:59:43.630 --> 03:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
occur you know obviously there's
 
03:59:46.750 --> 03:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
supportive care that you can provide um
 
03:59:48.910 --> 03:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
but even with you know that supportive
 
03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
care 10 to 20% of people will still die
 
03:59:53.309 --> 03:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
from the disease okay um and it's a
 
03:59:55.110 --> 03:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
toxin mediated disease meaning somebody
 
03:59:58.590 --> 03:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
gets it it causes convulsions paralysis
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
the the the lay person's term is lock
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
jaw because it causes such severe muscle
 
04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
spasms and convulsions that people can
 
04:00:08.590 --> 04:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
break their bones from the the dis from
 
04:00:12.389 --> 04:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
the Sy uh symptoms um so it's it's not a
 
04:00:15.229 --> 04:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
it's not a pretty disease um I'm I'm
 
04:00:16.990 --> 04:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
impressed that you've seen a case of
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
tetanus it's not common anymore because
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine um but it's not
 
04:00:24.670 --> 04:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
transmitted personto person thank you
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer thank you Mr Jaren
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for doing this one the
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
other things that come to mind would be
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
this would get in the way of any kind of
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
um issues around vectorborne disease
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
later on because that's not personto
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
person but it might I mean now that
 
04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
there's a malaria vaccine not that we
 
04:00:43.389 --> 04:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
have it here yet but who knows yeah no
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great Point thank you
 
04:00:46.910 --> 04:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
for that question you know um we
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
certainly can't predict the future of
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
what's coming with
 
04:00:53.950 --> 04:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines um but there are a number of
 
04:00:56.910 --> 04:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
other vaccines uh potentially out there
 
04:00:59.389 --> 04:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
in development um you know I think that
 
04:01:01.389 --> 04:01:01.399 align:start position:0%
the question is going to be and again
 
04:01:02.830 --> 04:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
just going back to the VAC you know we
 
04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
only require a subset of vaccines um for
 
04:01:09.870 --> 04:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
children entering school and child care
 
04:01:11.189 --> 04:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a number of
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
criteria that we often talk about you
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
know one is that the vaccine has to be
 
04:01:18.030 --> 04:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
highly effective um you know and second
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
it needs to be effective at preventing
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
infection and preventing you know
 
04:01:24.510 --> 04:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
outbreaks um and so you know whether a
 
04:01:27.389 --> 04:01:27.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine would sort of meet that criteria
 
04:01:28.950 --> 04:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
I I think remains to be seen what the
 
04:01:30.910 --> 04:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
what the vaccine is um you know we've
 
04:01:32.349 --> 04:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
also talked in the past about how we
 
04:01:34.710 --> 04:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't require and don't plan to require
 
04:01:36.550 --> 04:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines like influenza vaccine or
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine because these are
 
04:01:40.510 --> 04:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
recurring vaccines where you see
 
04:01:42.269 --> 04:01:42.279 align:start position:0%
efficacy drop off over time and so what
 
04:01:45.389 --> 04:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
we're really looking for um when we um
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
add a vaccine to the required list which
 
04:01:51.389 --> 04:01:51.399 align:start position:0%
we haven't done in many years um it's
 
04:01:54.590 --> 04:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
really high efficacy preventing um
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
outbreaks and spread of disease and
 
04:01:58.550 --> 04:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
child care and school settings um it
 
04:02:00.750 --> 04:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
just so happens that with tetanus uh you
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
can't get the tetanus vaccine without
 
04:02:04.389 --> 04:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
also getting vaccinated for some of
 
04:02:07.229 --> 04:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
these other highly communicable diseases
 
04:02:09.070 --> 04:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
um and that poses a problem with this
 
04:02:09.080 --> 04:02:11.070 align:start position:0%
um and that poses a problem with this
current

04:02:11.070 --> 04:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
legislation okay uh representative
 
04:02:17.309 --> 04:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman um I just
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
want to raise a question of uh the
 
04:02:22.469 --> 04:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of an employee of the um
 
04:02:22.479 --> 04:02:23.590 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of an employee of the um
executive

04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
executive
 
04:02:26.830 --> 04:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
branch um coming here in His official
 
04:02:29.229 --> 04:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
capacity and supporting or opposing a
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
bill and not just providing technical
 
04:02:34.030 --> 04:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
information um I believe that
 
04:02:36.550 --> 04:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
instructing the agents is a right for
 
04:02:38.469 --> 04:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
the people in part one it's reserved to
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
them it's not a right given to um
 
04:02:45.309 --> 04:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
government agents in place of um the
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
people so I I just see a little bit of a
 
04:02:50.910 --> 04:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
conflict here I feel that they either
 
04:02:52.710 --> 04:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
should only be offering the technical
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
advice without supporting or opposing if
 
04:02:57.550 --> 04:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
they're here on behalf of the state and
 
04:03:00.389 --> 04:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
um or be here as a private person and
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.189 --> 04:03:08.199 align:start position:0%
oppose all right uh any reaction
 
04:03:11.429 --> 04:03:11.439 align:start position:0%
gentlemen or for that comment or I I I
 
04:03:13.149 --> 04:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
guess I'll just say that you know I I
 
04:03:15.630 --> 04:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
think we've oftentimes taken so there's
 
04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
a number of options uh certainly
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
providing information is one option but
 
04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
we have certainly the the department has
 
04:03:24.790 --> 04:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know opposed and supported bills uh
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
even that that also you know impact our
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
authorities so that's uh I I think
 
04:03:31.710 --> 04:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill is not outside of the
 
04:03:36.149 --> 04:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
realm of uh the the positions and uh the
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
processes of the department in the past
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
04:03:44.279 --> 04:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
thank

04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
you last person I have signed up to
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
testify on HB
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:06.070 --> 04:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
Bedford good afternoon my name is Laura
 
04:04:08.590 --> 04:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
Condon I'm from Bedford New Hampshire
 
04:04:12.670 --> 04:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
and I um I support I support this change
 
04:04:15.590 --> 04:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the definition because this is an era
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
in the definition of non-communicable
 
04:04:20.910 --> 04:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
and it warrants correction in
 
04:04:23.030 --> 04:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
statute the committee should be aware
 
04:04:26.189 --> 04:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
that over 76% of the vaccines purchased
 
04:04:27.870 --> 04:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
and sold by the Department of Health and
 
04:04:30.830 --> 04:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services are on a voluntary use
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
basis this demonstrates that parents
 
04:04:36.149 --> 04:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
will actively choose vaccination for
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
their children even if it's not required
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
by State Statute there is no expectation
 
04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
that people won't use the tetanus um
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine for for their children so that
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:55.030 --> 04:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
concern there the requirements of
 
04:04:58.830 --> 04:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines are are are for products that
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
contain risk they are not risk-free
 
04:05:02.910 --> 04:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
products and so because of that they
 
04:05:04.830 --> 04:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
must only apply to diseases that can
 
04:05:07.950 --> 04:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
actually be spread from child to child
 
04:05:10.590 --> 04:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
the attent of vaccination requirements
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
are to prevent the spread of disease in
 
04:05:15.750 --> 04:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
the community not specifically to
 
04:05:17.149 --> 04:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
protect one
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
individual um if we were protecting one
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
individual we would be mandating um that
 
04:05:24.189 --> 04:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be allowed to eat the junk
 
04:05:26.269 --> 04:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
cereal and the donuts they're eating for
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
breakfast there are now over 70 doses of
 
04:05:32.349 --> 04:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines recommended for children from
 
04:05:34.990 --> 04:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
birth to age 18 now that is not a
 
04:05:37.870 --> 04:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
misstatement over 70 doses of vaccines
 
04:05:39.389 --> 04:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
recommended for children from birth to
 
04:05:42.990 --> 04:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
age 18 by the CDC there are dozens of
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
more vaccines in the pipeline there
 
04:05:48.429 --> 04:05:48.439 align:start position:0%
could be vaccines against obesity and if
 
04:05:51.710 --> 04:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a proper definition um in
 
04:05:53.630 --> 04:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
statute those sort of vaccines could be
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
required for
 
04:05:58.189 --> 04:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
children to speak because the tetnus was
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
raised I wanted to add some comments
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
about this because I was involved in
 
04:06:03.750 --> 04:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
Prior legislation with regard to
 
04:06:06.910 --> 04:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination um against tetanus tetanus
 
04:06:09.550 --> 04:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
is a bacteria that's ubiquitous it's
 
04:06:11.469 --> 04:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
everywhere it's probably here it's
 
04:06:14.510 --> 04:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
probably on you it's
 
04:06:17.309 --> 04:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
everywhere it's extremely rare that
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
anybody who comes in contact with
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
tetanus because we all do may have an
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
adverse illness uh outcome in fact if
 
04:06:26.910 --> 04:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
somebody is experienced symptoms of
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
tetanus you actually can't test for
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
tetanus it's not like you can do you
 
04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
know a bacterial culture and test for
 
04:06:34.830 --> 04:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
tetanus because tetanus is ubiquitous
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
it's everywhere so it's actually a
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of elimination so they test
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
the person could it be this could it be
 
04:06:43.149 --> 04:06:43.159 align:start position:0%
that could it be this could it be that
 
04:06:46.750 --> 04:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
it's not so they said well must be tetus
 
04:06:48.550 --> 04:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
in fact if you look at the cases of
 
04:06:52.030 --> 04:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
tetanus in this country um it is only in
 
04:06:55.149 --> 04:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
the very elderly those over age 60 they
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
are chronically ill with severe
 
04:07:00.630 --> 04:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
illnesses often in um already um in some
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
sort of Medical Institution in spite of
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
that and there might be two dozen cases
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
a year in spite of that the Mortal
 
04:07:12.149 --> 04:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
mortality rate is extremely low um 99%
 
04:07:15.070 --> 04:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
of those chronically individuals survive
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
their diagnoses of tetanus and you'd
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
think that you know there would be much
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
more outbreaks because the the majority
 
04:07:25.630 --> 04:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
of adults actually are not current with
 
04:07:29.109 --> 04:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
um tetanus recommendations so for those
 
04:07:31.510 --> 04:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
reasons I do believe that this this bill
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
is a necessary bill at this time and I
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take any questions
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
04:07:41.070 --> 04:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
representative kushman thank you Mr
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
chairman so in your view is this just a
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
correction of of an incorrect definition
 
04:07:49.389 --> 04:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
because the definition of
 
04:07:51.389 --> 04:07:51.399 align:start position:0%
communicable I
 
04:07:54.109 --> 04:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
non-communicable ab ab absolutely it it
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
is you know just an error that was made
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
um when you know the the definition of
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
non-communicable was put in place and um
 
04:08:05.910 --> 04:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's a technical area that that needs to
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
be corrected um
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
to protect our children from vaccines
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
that don't address a communic
 
04:08:17.229 --> 04:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
problem representative paza thank you Mr
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
question in in your research uh uh and
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
your data uh do you see any
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
contradiction uh uh to the statement
 
04:08:31.750 --> 04:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
that uh it's this uh tetanus vaccine is
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
close to 100% effective Could It Be
 
04:08:38.550 --> 04:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
Still true that it's 100% % effective
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
that the vaccination is 100% effective
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.910 --> 04:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nel you acting
 
04:08:53.760 --> 04:08:55.429 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nel you acting
like

04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
you well we prefer
 
04:08:58.080 --> 04:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
you well we prefer
questions

04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:09:03.149 --> 04:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions I'm saying n
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.670 --> 04:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
you I have no one else that signed up
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
for to uh speak to HB 11194 does anyone
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
else wish to speak to HB
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
11194 uh on the blue sheet in the back
 
04:09:20.109 --> 04:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of people expressing their
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
position on this bill um seven people
 
04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
signed up in favor and two people signed
 
04:09:26.080 --> 04:09:27.149 align:start position:0%
signed up in favor and two people signed
up

04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
against Mr chairman uh yes
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
representative kushman do we know what
 
04:09:34.630 --> 04:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
the numbers on the um online Portal sign
 
04:09:38.309 --> 04:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
in I I do not know that no that might be
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to understand where you
 
04:09:43.189 --> 04:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
know what the public opinion if most
 
04:09:45.030 --> 04:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
have been the number of and that that
 
04:09:47.550 --> 04:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
may be continuing even Beyond Today
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
certainly especially for executive
 
04:09:51.309 --> 04:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
session that might be something to be
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.109 --> 04:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
go representative Palmer I think that
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
might be because the online testimony
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly did not the people did
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
not list where they're from and I'd like
 
04:10:16.590 --> 04:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
to know on on the online will'll see how
 
04:10:18.149 --> 04:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
many people in New Hampshire actually
 
04:10:19.710 --> 04:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
have an opinion one way or the other so
 
04:10:19.720 --> 04:10:21.389 align:start position:0%
have an opinion one way or the other so
that

04:10:21.389 --> 04:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:24.750 --> 04:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
sure anything else on HB
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
1194 saying none I'm going to close the
 
04:10:28.990 --> 04:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB
 
04:10:31.550 --> 04:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
1194 next public hearing scheduled is
 
04:10:35.149 --> 04:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
not until 2:00 for hb1 1213 FN so we

will be in recess for the next 20
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:06.359 --> 04:32:11.550 align:start position:0%
 
2:00

04:32:11.550 --> 04:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:14.550 --> 04:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and welcome back to the
 
04:32:15.790 --> 04:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
house committee on Health and Human
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs the next
 
04:32:21.109 --> 04:32:21.119 align:start position:0%

once again we're seeing a lot of
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
Representative Phillips
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
today we could have canceled today if it
 
04:32:35.710 --> 04:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't for you you know it's a i very
 
04:32:37.149 --> 04:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
much appreciate having everything
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
scheduled on one day thank you um
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
everyone good afternoon again um so I am
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
on the child care the special committee
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
for child care and we have heard a ton
 
04:32:48.309 --> 04:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
of testimony that uh there is not enough
 
04:32:50.349 --> 04:32:50.359 align:start position:0%
supply of child care providers in New
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that there plenty of demand
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
and that they are overworked
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
underappreciated and they have a lot of
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
Burden uh as far as paperwork so this
 
04:33:02.710 --> 04:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
bill was written in a way to allow um
 
04:33:04.990 --> 04:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
daycare workers to opt out of collecting
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines information uh we threw in the
 
04:33:10.750 --> 04:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
private schools too um there's just
 
04:33:12.510 --> 04:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard overwhelmingly in the online
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
portal you'll see uh from daycare
 
04:33:15.629 --> 04:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
workers who support this bill because
 
04:33:18.269 --> 04:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
they're not trained to handle um
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
confidential medical information and
 
04:33:22.109 --> 04:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
they feel like they're constantly
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
chasing down parents who children are
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
due for vaccination um or updated
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
paperwork um as you know our state has a
 
04:33:33.551 --> 04:33:33.561 align:start position:0%
um uh great exemption program so
 
04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're just getting the
 
04:33:37.029 --> 04:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
initial exemption from the child but
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
other times they're chasing people down
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
um so it's not really a public health
 
04:33:42.510 --> 04:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
issue because some people have
 
04:33:44.269 --> 04:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
exemptions some people are are following
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
the schedule so we're just trying to
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
relieve um the paperwork burden for
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
daycares in private schools because who
 
04:33:51.189 --> 04:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
are we to tell private businesses what
 
04:33:55.070 --> 04:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
to do so that's the gist of it um
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
04:34:02.269 --> 04:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay oh
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
representative HB
 
04:34:08.429 --> 04:34:08.439 align:start position:0%
1213 I do have a question okay sure um
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
my question I I I I become a stickler on
 
04:34:17.510 --> 04:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
definitions um so this is going to sound
 
04:34:19.470 --> 04:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
like a really weird question but is
 
04:34:20.990 --> 04:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
there I I was looking to see if there's
 
04:34:23.949 --> 04:34:23.959 align:start position:0%
any definition of Public School versus
 
04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
private school anywhere in statute and I
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
went through I couldn't find one and I'm
 
04:34:31.869 --> 04:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
just curious given the complexity of
 
04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
Education these days is that's Germain
 
04:34:34.279 --> 04:34:36.109 align:start position:0%
Education these days is that's Germain
or

04:34:36.109 --> 04:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:34:37.390 --> 04:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
a very good question I don't know the
 
04:34:38.910 --> 04:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
answer to that maybe someone behind me
 
04:34:43.629 --> 04:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
can Define it thank you thank
 
04:34:43.639 --> 04:34:45.949 align:start position:0%
can Define it thank you thank
you

04:34:45.949 --> 04:34:45.959 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
okay also signed up to speak are Dr
 
04:34:52.750 --> 04:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
tanan and Dr Chan from from the
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.590 --> 04:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
Services good afternoon again um I'm Dr
 
04:35:08.510 --> 04:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
Ryan Tan and I'm joined with Dr Benjamin
 
04:35:11.109 --> 04:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
Chan and uh we're here to speak about
 
04:35:11.119 --> 04:35:12.789 align:start position:0%
Chan and uh we're here to speak about
hb1

04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
04:35:15.510 --> 04:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
12113 and uh the department at this time
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
we do oppose um the bill as written so
 
04:35:21.310 --> 04:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
this bill actually does more than um
 
04:35:23.349 --> 04:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
minimize or reduce the reporting
 
04:35:25.150 --> 04:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
requirements uh which I can talk to in a
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
moment but um hb1 1213 would also um
 
04:35:32.910 --> 04:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
remove the requirement of the vaccines
 
04:35:35.670 --> 04:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
that are currently required in childcare
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
agencies and private schools and it
 
04:35:39.629 --> 04:35:39.639 align:start position:0%
would be limited only to children who
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
are attending Public Schools so the
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
department uh believes that this would
 
04:35:45.869 --> 04:35:45.879 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily Place children teachers
 
04:35:48.429 --> 04:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
School staff uh both at schools and
 
04:35:50.910 --> 04:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
child care agencies uh public or private
 
04:35:53.629 --> 04:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
at risk for infectious disease outbreaks
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh we believe it would also negatively
 
04:35:57.709 --> 04:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
impact the effect of the surrounding
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
Community um you know for example I can
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
share with you right now uh Philadelphia
 
04:36:05.150 --> 04:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
recently identified a measles outbreak
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
break in a child care center and uh this
 
04:36:10.910 --> 04:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
was in December of 2013 and the
 
04:36:11.949 --> 04:36:11.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health in
 
04:36:14.830 --> 04:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia is working with three Area
 
04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
Children's Hospitals where patients may
 
04:36:18.830 --> 04:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
have been exposed as well as other
 
04:36:20.551 --> 04:36:20.561 align:start position:0%
hospitals and an urgent care center to
 
04:36:23.150 --> 04:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
identify individuals who may be at
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
risk um additionally there's just a
 
04:36:28.830 --> 04:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
growing number of meil outbreaks
 
04:36:30.990 --> 04:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
reported globally as well as uh here in
 
04:36:33.269 --> 04:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
the United States and these outbreaks
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
not only put the health and safety all
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
children regardless of what type of
 
04:36:39.670 --> 04:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
school or educational model they may be
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh pursuing but it puts everyone at risk
 
04:36:44.590 --> 04:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh and when we do go to investigate and
 
04:36:46.590 --> 04:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
bring these investigations under control
 
04:36:48.750 --> 04:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
they actually are quite costly there was
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
a study in 2020 that reviewed measles
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
outbreaks from 2001 to 2018 and was
 
04:37:01.349 --> 04:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:01.359 --> 04:37:03.150 align:start position:0%
 
$12,383

04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
$12,383
 
04:37:05.470 --> 04:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
18,000 and these costs were Associated
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
to the public health response
 
04:37:06.840 --> 04:37:08.470 align:start position:0%
to the public health response
hospitalizations

04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations
 
04:37:10.510 --> 04:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
investigations um and other things that
 
04:37:12.910 --> 04:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
go into bringing those outbreaks under
 
04:37:16.109 --> 04:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
control and also facilities would
 
04:37:18.189 --> 04:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
possibly have to voluntarily close if
 
04:37:20.429 --> 04:37:20.439 align:start position:0%
there's health risks due to uh their
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
staff it may also affect um Staffing
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
ratios and other reasons for why a child
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
close so the dment also believes that we
 
04:37:34.949 --> 04:37:34.959 align:start position:0%
already have a process in place that's
 
04:37:36.750 --> 04:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to protect all children
 
04:37:39.629 --> 04:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire and also allows for
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
medical exemptions and religious
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
exemptions as far as the documentation
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
and Reporting requirements the
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
department does not collect or retain
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
any individual student or patient
 
04:37:53.470 --> 04:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
information that is managed at the
 
04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
school level what the department does do
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
is look at aggregate raw data about the
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
number of students in child care and
 
04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
school settings who are considered
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
upto-date or may be exempt from a
 
04:38:08.429 --> 04:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine ination and it also helps our uh
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
Folks at Public Health work with school
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
programs to work on any sort of process
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
Improvement or quality initiatives and I
 
04:38:16.990 --> 04:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
can share a recent example where there
 
04:38:20.590 --> 04:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
was a school that had a um had reported
 
04:38:23.629 --> 04:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
a odd-looking number of exemptions we
 
04:38:25.949 --> 04:38:25.959 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with the school nurse
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
and it was a new school nurse it was
 
04:38:30.269 --> 04:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
their first year working um and they
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
were actually reporting the information
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
incorrectly so we were able to work with
 
04:38:35.709 --> 04:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
them after reviewing some of the
 
04:38:36.910 --> 04:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
information and make sure that what
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're reporting is
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
accurate and then lastly uh you know we
 
04:38:42.510 --> 04:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
believe that the all New Hampshire
 
04:38:43.551 --> 04:38:43.561 align:start position:0%
children should have an equal
 
04:38:45.470 --> 04:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to attend school or child
 
04:38:47.629 --> 04:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
care in a healthy and safe environment
 
04:38:48.750 --> 04:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
and we believe that there's already
 
04:38:50.429 --> 04:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
proper measures in place to protect
 
04:38:51.470 --> 04:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
against these
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
diseases I want to thank you for the
 
04:38:54.551 --> 04:38:54.561 align:start position:0%
opportunity today and we're happy to
 
04:38:56.949 --> 04:38:56.959 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have thank
 
04:38:56.959 --> 04:38:59.109 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have thank
any

04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
questions yeah representative Murphy
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a tech um it
 
04:39:06.189 --> 04:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
says on the card that you have submitted
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and I believe you did that um
 
04:39:10.429 --> 04:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct I I I trying to find
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
it I was just wondering when you get
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
back could you send a that out again
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps that testimony is if you're
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
going to do that even 1194 because I i'
 
04:39:20.590 --> 04:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
just like to get both copies if I could
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
much representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm understanding this
 
04:39:31.949 --> 04:39:31.959 align:start position:0%
bill properly um as I read
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
it the children are still required to
 
04:39:36.869 --> 04:39:36.879 align:start position:0%
have the these immunizations what no
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
longer would exist if this bill takes
 
04:39:40.868 --> 04:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
place is that the Child Care Agency or
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
the private school would have to
 
04:39:44.788 --> 04:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
maintain the records and and demonstrate
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
that they've had those so in other words
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
if I start there I don't have to bring a
 
04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
record that I have had this immunization
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
am I reading that bill
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
wrong so so what I what I will say the
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
interpretation that the department had
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
on this bill there's three three pieces
 
04:40:01.788 --> 04:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
to this where one it is now removing the
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
requirement for children who are
 
04:40:06.190 --> 04:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
attending child child care or private
 
04:40:08.550 --> 04:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
schools would no longer be required to
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
have vaccinations the second point is
 
04:40:13.150 --> 04:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
the department would not have the
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
ability to review any sort of
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
immunization records at the school and
 
04:40:21.430 --> 04:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
um lastly only Public Schools would be
 
04:40:23.910 --> 04:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
required to report the aggregate data to
 
04:40:23.920 --> 04:40:24.750 align:start position:0%
required to report the aggregate data to
the

04:40:24.750 --> 04:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:27.910 --> 04:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
state can I follow up follow up as as I
 
04:40:29.910 --> 04:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
see it is the the the requirement to
 
04:40:33.150 --> 04:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
have the immunization is line one of the
 
04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
statute um but that doesn't seem to be
 
04:40:37.590 --> 04:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
removed it's only the changes in line
 
04:40:39.390 --> 04:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
two so according to what I'm reading
 
04:40:41.310 --> 04:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
they still have to get the immunization
 
04:40:44.310 --> 04:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
the the agency or the school doesn't
 
04:40:44.320 --> 04:40:45.470 align:start position:0%
the the agency or the school doesn't
have

04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:40:56.110 --> 04:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.110 --> 04:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
correct right so thank you again for for
 
04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
this question but as the we reviewed at
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
the department we interpret this as the
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements in 141 c20a
 
04:41:10.510 --> 04:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
would no longer be required for children
 
04:41:15.390 --> 04:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
schools you all
 
04:41:20.550 --> 04:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
set okay representative kosman thank you
 
04:41:24.070 --> 04:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for um making
 
04:41:27.750 --> 04:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
that statement um if that's your reading
 
04:41:30.670 --> 04:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
that the documentation requirement of
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
this law it requires either than
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
immunization records or an exemption is
 
04:41:38.160 --> 04:41:40.270 align:start position:0%
immunization records or an exemption is
that

04:41:40.270 --> 04:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:42.310 --> 04:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
correct I'm sorry could you state the
 
04:41:44.830 --> 04:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
question again so the Department's
 
04:41:48.430 --> 04:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law is that if
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass that there would
 
04:41:52.750 --> 04:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
no longer be a
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
requirement um for private um schools
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
and daycare
 
04:42:02.310 --> 04:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
agencies uh to ensure that children have
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated according to the
 
04:42:09.310 --> 04:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
RSA correct correct so then does it also
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
follow that it's the position of the
 
04:42:14.590 --> 04:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
department that agencies also must
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
accept exemptions since the statute says
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
that they have to take
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
either have to keep either the record or
 
04:42:26.070 --> 04:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
the record of an
 
04:42:29.708 --> 04:42:29.718 align:start position:0%
exemption so the exemptions whether it's
 
04:42:32.788 --> 04:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
a record of immunization or an exemption
 
04:42:34.110 --> 04:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
the department does not collect that
 
04:42:35.628 --> 04:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
information that's maintained at the
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
school or the Child Care Agency
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
right but you're saying that the statute
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
requires the kids to be vaccinated to go
 
04:42:46.948 --> 04:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
to the daycare or the private school it
 
04:42:49.390 --> 04:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
Al it also it says immunization or
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
exemption or posal immunization so all
 
04:42:55.110 --> 04:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
three of those one of those three is
 
04:42:57.628 --> 04:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
required for a child to go to a daycare
 
04:43:00.430 --> 04:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
or a school in New Hampshire per this
 
04:43:03.070 --> 04:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
RSA that's how the department is uh
 
04:43:07.350 --> 04:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
as currently written or what's being
 
04:43:13.270 --> 04:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
proposed as currently written yeah so as
 
04:43:17.310 --> 04:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
currently written RSA 141
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
c20a children attending Child Care
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
public or private schools either require
 
04:43:27.948 --> 04:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
documentation of the immunization or an
 
04:43:30.670 --> 04:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
exemption thank you can I ask one more
 
04:43:34.070 --> 04:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
followup one followup one more okay so
 
04:43:36.910 --> 04:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
if if this bill passed then it would
 
04:43:40.230 --> 04:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
remove a requirement for children to be
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
either vaccinated and show proof of that
 
04:43:45.390 --> 04:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
and it would also remove the requirement
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
exemptions I would have to look into
 
04:43:55.708 --> 04:43:55.718 align:start position:0%
this in more detail to answer the
 
04:43:57.708 --> 04:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
question about accepting the exemptions
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
but our initial interpretation is the
 
04:44:02.708 --> 04:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements would only
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
apply to children attending Public
 
04:44:07.948 --> 04:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
Schools thank so there yes does that
 
04:44:10.510 --> 04:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
answer your question thank you yes
 
04:44:10.520 --> 04:44:11.948 align:start position:0%
answer your question thank you yes
representative

04:44:11.948 --> 04:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
palazov uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:44:18.270 --> 04:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh is my
 
04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
understanding correct that state and
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
specifically DHHS uh uh in uh business
 
04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
of providing uh selling some of those
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines and if so like uh let's say the
 
04:44:38.670 --> 04:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
case scenarios that all public private
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
schools and daycare centers would
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
stop uh those kids stop uh purchasing
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
and using those vaccines uh what would
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
what would be financial
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
implications for DHHS and
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh can you
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
elaborate yes thank you for the question
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
so the the state does not sell vaccines
 
04:45:06.030 --> 04:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
um and vaccinations are actually
 
04:45:08.190 --> 04:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
conducted at the the child's
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
pediatrician's office or or family care
 
04:45:15.150 --> 04:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
provider um is any clinics that may be
 
04:45:17.708 --> 04:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
conducted at a school particularly the
 
04:45:20.910 --> 04:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
school-based influenza clinics are uh
 
04:45:22.590 --> 04:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
you know conducted through uh either
 
04:45:24.070 --> 04:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with healthc Care Systems
 
04:45:25.708 --> 04:45:25.718 align:start position:0%
or the regional public health networks
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
so uh aside from a
 
04:45:33.550 --> 04:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
transactional uh aspect to purchase and
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
selling vaccines there would be no
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
impact but we believe that there would
 
04:45:39.510 --> 04:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
be a financial impact potentially to
 
04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
child carees or private schools that may
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
have to close due to disease outbreak or
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
increased health care costs due to
 
04:45:49.230 --> 04:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
increased um um children Contracting
 
04:45:50.830 --> 04:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases that are prevented
 
04:45:50.840 --> 04:45:53.750 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases that are prevented
by

04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:56.350 --> 04:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines any other
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.200 --> 04:46:08.110 align:start position:0%
 
gentlemen

04:46:08.110 --> 04:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:09.550 --> 04:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
Barry thank you Mr chairman um my name
 
04:46:22.990 --> 04:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
is uh representative Ross Barry I'm also
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
the uh chair of the house special
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee on Child Care um so this was
 
04:46:29.830 --> 04:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that came forward as
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
you guys know we've been working on ways
 
04:46:34.750 --> 04:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
to uh increase access to child care and
 
04:46:37.390 --> 04:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
decrease the cost of child care um while
 
04:46:40.150 --> 04:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
maintaining quality Child Care um so
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
this was one of the things that has come
 
04:46:44.910 --> 04:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
up um in our time is child care centers
 
04:46:48.190 --> 04:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
have a lot of paperwork burden a ton of
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
paperwork burden um I believe three
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
other childcare centers have written
 
04:46:54.470 --> 04:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
into the committee supporting this bill
 
04:46:56.590 --> 04:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
um this bill I I know that there's going
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
to be a tendency for this bill to try to
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
get caught up in the vaccine not vaccine
 
04:47:02.548 --> 04:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
debate so let me start off with I am
 
04:47:04.990 --> 04:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated my child is vac ated my wife
 
04:47:08.070 --> 04:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
is vaccinated I'm not antiva I have what
 
04:47:09.948 --> 04:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
you do with your body is in fact your
 
04:47:13.070 --> 04:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
choice um but what happens is is you
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
guys the state has turned Child Care
 
04:47:19.150 --> 04:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
Centers into this kind of faux Reporting
 
04:47:22.670 --> 04:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
Agency on vacines the irony being is we
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
have a religious exemption waiver so any
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
health argument that might be made is
 
04:47:30.670 --> 04:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
kind of moot because I could have all 65
 
04:47:33.708 --> 04:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
of my children that are under my care
 
04:47:36.190 --> 04:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
sign a religious exemption waiver and
 
04:47:38.350 --> 04:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
that would be perfectly compliant so
 
04:47:40.628 --> 04:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
what happens is is child care centers
 
04:47:42.190 --> 04:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
have to maintain these immunization
 
04:47:44.190 --> 04:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
records we get asked for them it's a
 
04:47:45.788 --> 04:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
recurring thing that we constantly have
 
04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
to update um and we're already you know
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
that's not why anybody got in the
 
04:47:52.548 --> 04:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
childcare industry was to track these
 
04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
medical records uh one of the things
 
04:47:57.270 --> 04:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to flag is there has been
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
kind of quiet concerns about Hippa
 
04:48:01.708 --> 04:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
violations because while Hippa doesn't
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
cover Child Care Centers specifically
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
you look at kind of like what's covered
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
it we do have medical um procedures that
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
are performed in a child care center um
 
04:48:15.150 --> 04:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
DCF might come in and perform a mental
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
exam um from a child they're
 
04:48:19.708 --> 04:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
investigating all of my teachers are you
 
04:48:22.110 --> 04:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
know we can give epipens we things the
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
claim has never been made but I am
 
04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
terrified that one day it will be made
 
04:48:28.910 --> 04:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
and it could be extended to us um and a
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
problem with that be is we are in no way
 
04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
hippoc compliant you are forcing parents
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
to turn over private medical information
 
04:48:39.788 --> 04:48:39.798 align:start position:0%
to us that we do not have to hold in a
 
04:48:41.948 --> 04:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
standard that another Med a medical
 
04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
center would hold so I I do worry about
 
04:48:46.110 --> 04:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
kind of the liability of that in the
 
04:48:48.708 --> 04:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
long run if that claim is ever made um
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
because while it wouldn't be a direct
 
04:48:54.030 --> 04:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
jump to that I do think that a um a a
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
sleuthing person using the law could
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually connect the two given the other
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
services that get provided at Child Care
 
04:49:01.708 --> 04:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
Centers outside of kind of what you
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
would normally think of um but we do I
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
do believe that this would reduce the
 
04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
burden uh it would reduce paperwork
 
04:49:12.270 --> 04:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
violations what happens is when DHHS
 
04:49:14.070 --> 04:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
issues a violation we have to post it
 
04:49:16.390 --> 04:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
prominently in our Center um most
 
04:49:18.670 --> 04:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
parents don't e either don't look at it
 
04:49:20.548 --> 04:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
or really look at it there's kind of two
 
04:49:21.788 --> 04:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
parents the ones that are really like oh
 
04:49:23.548 --> 04:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
my God what is this and the ones who
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
don't notice it's there um and then we
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
have to start explaining about you know
 
04:49:29.470 --> 04:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
if you miss one child right you can get
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
written up for that by DHHS and then you
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
have to post it publicly until they
 
04:49:35.548 --> 04:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
inspect you again um so these sort of
 
04:49:37.510 --> 04:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
things they do add up it's one of the
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
deals of kind of it was one of those
 
04:49:41.070 --> 04:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
things and you can kind of see it
 
04:49:42.190 --> 04:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
happening right it's like all right well
 
04:49:43.230 --> 04:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
we're just going to add this and we're
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
going to add this and we're going to add
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
this so one of the things we're trying
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
to do in the child care committee
 
04:49:49.110 --> 04:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
special committee on childcare is remove
 
04:49:50.548 --> 04:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
those things that have been added over
 
04:49:53.548 --> 04:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
time um so I'm happy to to answer any
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
questions about this um I will say uh
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS came up here and said there be a
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on Child Care Centers if
 
04:50:03.948 --> 04:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
we took away this requirement my
 
04:50:05.830 --> 04:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
personal belief in dealing with parents
 
04:50:07.470 --> 04:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
and children is that the overwhelming
 
04:50:09.548 --> 04:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
vast majority of parents are going to
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
get their children immunized because
 
04:50:13.510 --> 04:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
they believe it is the right thing to do
 
04:50:16.110 --> 04:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think the state requiring it to
 
04:50:17.070 --> 04:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
attend well the state doesn't even
 
04:50:18.070 --> 04:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
require it because you can sign the
 
04:50:20.270 --> 04:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
waiver um but I don't think the state
 
04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
having it on there I don't think that's
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
a valid um I I don't think that's a
 
04:50:29.150 --> 04:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
valid um uh a valid argument um just to
 
04:50:31.548 --> 04:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
be blunt you know the there's sick
 
04:50:33.150 --> 04:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
there's illnesses go through child care
 
04:50:36.548 --> 04:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
centers on a regular basis um it's not
 
04:50:38.190 --> 04:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
because a child care center is dirty
 
04:50:40.110 --> 04:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
like at my at my child care center we
 
04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
disinfect every night and then we do a
 
04:50:43.830 --> 04:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
deep clean every Thursday um and we
 
04:50:45.190 --> 04:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
still have stuff gets through there
 
04:50:48.190 --> 04:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
because kids are kids like you know they
 
04:50:50.910 --> 04:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
have um they have um you know they get
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
dirty and they they have weaker immune
 
04:50:53.868 --> 04:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
they have newer immune systems that
 
04:50:56.230 --> 04:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
don't have everything yet um so you know
 
04:50:58.030 --> 04:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
we're kind of used to dealing with that
 
04:50:59.868 --> 04:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
on on that front um so I wouldn't put a
 
04:51:01.708 --> 04:51:01.718 align:start position:0%
whole lot of weight to that um I haven't
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
met a single Cher Cent our owner that
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
has said we have to have these
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
immunization records otherwise we'll be
 
04:51:07.948 --> 04:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
shutting down because there's going to
 
04:51:09.670 --> 04:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
be a measles outbreak it just it just
 
04:51:11.070 --> 04:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
bluntly sounds a little far-fetched to
 
04:51:12.708 --> 04:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
me but anyways I'm happy to answer any
 
04:51:14.590 --> 04:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
questions like I said I I own a child
 
04:51:16.030 --> 04:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
care center over in epom New Hampshire
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's where I just came from it's why I
 
04:51:20.470 --> 04:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
look like this um but Happ to answer any
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the business side of
 
04:51:24.030 --> 04:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
Representative par you had a question or
 
04:51:27.150 --> 04:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
yeah well my question is really and and
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative Philip sort of said
 
04:51:30.510 --> 04:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
and we threw in public I mean private
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
schools and I'm sort of I've got two
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions about the private school thing
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
is one you know well why I mean there
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
are small private schools and I actually
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
my kids actually went to a little one
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
and I was one of the people who helped
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
collect the data because there wasn't a
 
04:51:46.750 --> 04:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
staff member to do that so that would
 
04:51:48.590 --> 04:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
fall into sort of the same boat that
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about about lack of
 
04:51:52.470 --> 04:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
resources but I doubt St Paul's has that
 
04:51:56.070 --> 04:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
problem and um and the second part of my
 
04:51:58.830 --> 04:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
question is so people send their kids to
 
04:52:00.670 --> 04:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
St Paul's from all over the place and
 
04:52:02.310 --> 04:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
there are a bunch of other big private
 
04:52:05.190 --> 04:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire that have kids
 
04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
from everywhere and I would imagine
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
those the parents of a lot of those kids
 
04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
are sort of expecting that the school is
 
04:52:11.948 --> 04:52:11.958 align:start position:0%
keeping track of that because there's no
 
04:52:13.788 --> 04:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
way the state could keep track of
 
04:52:15.948 --> 04:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
somebody who's coming from California to
 
04:52:18.750 --> 04:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
go to school there so I guess I'm a
 
04:52:21.830 --> 04:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit Leary about putting the
 
04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
public the private schools into this
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
boat along with the daycare centers I
 
04:52:27.390 --> 04:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
mean I I don't know what the the
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
question is there I don't I don't work
 
04:52:30.628 --> 04:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
in the CH in the private school space I
 
04:52:31.990 --> 04:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
can't say dealing with parents they're
 
04:52:33.990 --> 04:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
usually more generally surprised that we
 
04:52:37.548 --> 04:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
ask for that um but you know it's it's
 
04:52:39.548 --> 04:52:39.558 align:start position:0%
uh I I can't speak for private schools I
 
04:52:41.230 --> 04:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
don't I don't work inside of a private
 
04:52:42.150 --> 04:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
school setting working inside of a
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
childcare setting I guess maybe I'll put
 
04:52:45.310 --> 04:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
the question the other way then would
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
you mind having this bill amended to
 
04:52:49.868 --> 04:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
take private schools out of it um I mean
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
if that makes it more likely to pass
 
04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
that would be that that would be my
 
04:52:53.868 --> 04:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
statement if it makes more likely for
 
04:52:56.270 --> 04:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
the bill to be successful then sure my
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
my philosophical answer would be leave
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
them in but if it makes it uh you know
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
politics is not a dictatorship so um
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
trust me I have to make deals all the
 
04:53:05.548 --> 04:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
time in election law that I don't always
 
04:53:05.558 --> 04:53:06.830 align:start position:0%
time in election law that I don't always
love

04:53:06.830 --> 04:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
love
 
04:53:09.708 --> 04:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
so other
 
04:53:12.910 --> 04:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
questions see oh representative kachman
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:53:17.430 --> 04:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative um being that you uh run
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
a child care center is it your
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of the law that the law
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
says that children have to have um is it
 
04:53:26.590 --> 04:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
your understanding that you have to
 
04:53:28.868 --> 04:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
honor exemptions if you receive them as
 
04:53:30.628 --> 04:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
a part of that law you have to honor
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
either an exemption or a vaccination and
 
04:53:35.788 --> 04:53:35.798 align:start position:0%
that you can't discriminate you can't
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
keep kids out uh uh correct and there
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
was I believe in the written test the
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
answer question is yes I believe in one
 
04:53:42.510 --> 04:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
of the written testimonies you received
 
04:53:44.470 --> 04:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
from one of the other child care centers
 
04:53:47.110 --> 04:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
we don't check into whether or not there
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
is a I don't care a legitimate religious
 
04:53:53.070 --> 04:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
exemption right we don't put them up to
 
04:53:55.390 --> 04:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
some sort of religious louth test uh nor
 
04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
would we by the way um it would be
 
04:53:59.350 --> 04:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
grossly inappropriate to do that um we
 
04:54:01.548 --> 04:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
just take them on their word um I would
 
04:54:03.788 --> 04:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
be stunned if there weren't parents just
 
04:54:06.670 --> 04:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
signed that form just to avoid having to
 
04:54:08.190 --> 04:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
either turn that information over or go
 
04:54:11.430 --> 04:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
get it from their child's PCP um it's it
 
04:54:13.510 --> 04:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
is definitely a catchall um and I don't
 
04:54:14.548 --> 04:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
see a way in which you could
 
04:54:15.990 --> 04:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
legitimately enforce it because how are
 
04:54:17.830 --> 04:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
you to determine what somebody's true
 
04:54:20.310 --> 04:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs are especially a
 
04:54:23.310 --> 04:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
Childcare Center
 
04:54:25.868 --> 04:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
employee my representative Shapiro thank
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so if you share my
 
04:54:30.990 --> 04:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
assumption which maybe you don't that
 
04:54:33.750 --> 04:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
tracking vaccinations through Public
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
Schools private schools dayc carees
 
04:54:38.830 --> 04:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
overall improves compliance and the
 
04:54:41.708 --> 04:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
numbers of people who get vaccines if
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
you share that
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
assumption but it's such a problem with
 
04:54:50.070 --> 04:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce and um you know tedious
 
04:54:52.230 --> 04:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic work that you that daycare
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
centers have to do can you think of
 
04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
another alternative to kind of track
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinations in a way that would
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
encourage people getting them and and
 
04:55:04.830 --> 04:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
and and encouraging Public Health
 
04:55:07.030 --> 04:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
basically you know I I think you need to
 
04:55:09.150 --> 04:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
let people be people and make the
 
04:55:11.230 --> 04:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
decisions that are best for them right
 
04:55:13.868 --> 04:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example for myself um I
 
04:55:15.548 --> 04:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
every single year I go to the doctor and
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
every single year I get a flu shot every
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
single year I go to the doctor and every
 
04:55:20.750 --> 04:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
single year I get a pneumonia shot why
 
04:55:22.510 --> 04:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
because I've had pneumonia three times
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
been in the hospital for it um people
 
04:55:27.310 --> 04:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
should be able I I believe that most
 
04:55:30.270 --> 04:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
people believe that vaccines keep them
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
healthy that's their business um I am
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
not a doctor I'm not here to tell them
 
04:55:36.230 --> 04:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
it is or is not I personally believe
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
that it is and that's why I put them in
 
04:55:40.030 --> 04:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
my body um there are certain vaccines I
 
04:55:41.070 --> 04:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
haven't put in my body because I
 
04:55:43.548 --> 04:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
question that um you know I I don't
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
think that using Child Care Centers as
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
an arm of the government to encourage
 
04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
people to get vaccines is appropriate um
 
04:55:52.590 --> 04:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
I think what would be more appropriate
 
04:55:54.390 --> 04:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
would be a public health campaign or
 
04:55:56.910 --> 04:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
going to the doctors directly um and
 
04:55:58.670 --> 04:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
maybe having Anonymous aggregated data
 
04:55:59.830 --> 04:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
from the doctors who are the ones
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
actually administering the shots um I
 
04:56:02.948 --> 04:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
think that would be more appropriate
 
04:56:05.030 --> 04:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
than using Child Care Centers as a
 
04:56:08.670 --> 04:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:19.510 --> 04:56:19.520 align:start position:0%

regulation requirements for those
 
04:57:49.470 --> 04:57:49.480 align:start position:0%

records of either being immun immunized
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%

04:58:49.948 --> 04:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
voluntarily from what you just said is
 
04:58:49.958 --> 04:58:51.110 align:start position:0%
voluntarily from what you just said is

that
 
04:58:53.788 --> 04:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
correct yes absolutely as long as this
 
04:58:56.430 --> 04:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
bill is written in a way that doesn't
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
exclude these programs from having to
 
04:59:01.350 --> 04:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
meet that Federal
 
04:59:04.190 --> 04:59:04.200 align:start position:0%

you Mr chairman and thank you for being
 
04:59:09.548 --> 04:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
here um reading this it says that um it
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything that prohibits the
 
04:59:13.110 --> 04:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
child care agencies or the private
 
04:59:15.310 --> 04:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
schools from keeping those records it
 
04:59:18.030 --> 04:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
simply removes the shell the requirement
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
that they keep them and the requirement
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
that they keep them available for the
 
04:59:23.548 --> 04:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
for inspection without any language
 
04:59:25.070 --> 04:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
prohibiting them from keeping these
 
04:59:26.470 --> 04:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
records if they're able to access
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
federal funds would that resolve your
 
04:59:31.150 --> 04:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
objection um I'm neutral I'm sharing
 
04:59:34.548 --> 04:59:34.558 align:start position:0%

04:59:41.708 --> 04:59:41.718 align:start position:0%
for these programs sorry and then as the
 
04:59:43.270 --> 04:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
followup so you don't see anything that
 
04:59:44.948 --> 04:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
would prohibit them from keeping these
 
04:59:48.190 --> 04:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
records in this bill as
 
04:59:50.670 --> 04:59:50.680 align:start position:0%

which requires them to have immunization
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%

advocacy from new Futures a lot of my
 
05:01:29.948 --> 05:01:29.958 align:start position:0%
points were said before but we do oppose
 
05:01:32.990 --> 05:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
HB 1213 both from a public health point
 
05:01:35.548 --> 05:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
of view and the impact it could have to
 
05:01:39.230 --> 05:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
um Child Care programs um we really view
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
this as a way to weaken the New
 
05:01:43.590 --> 05:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire childhood um immunization
 
05:01:46.030 --> 05:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
program we have a very strong program
 
05:01:49.230 --> 05:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
that offers uh access to all New
 
05:01:52.190 --> 05:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um children free of charge
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
through a very um collaborative effort
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
with federal funds General funds and the
 
05:02:00.548 --> 05:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
um uh insurance companies we've in the
 
05:02:03.070 --> 05:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
past have very high rates we've being
 
05:02:06.030 --> 05:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
rates drop because of the pandemic like
 
05:02:08.670 --> 05:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
many states have and this Con the
 
05:02:10.830 --> 05:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
concern about this bill is it's just one
 
05:02:14.510 --> 05:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
more way to um have less uh see those
 
05:02:19.230 --> 05:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination uh rates drop more um if we
 
05:02:21.590 --> 05:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
see more of those rates drop we will
 
05:02:25.390 --> 05:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
open the door to um uh previously
 
05:02:28.190 --> 05:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
eradicated diseases uh I won't I have a
 
05:02:30.628 --> 05:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
lot more detail in my testimony um but
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
we are especially concerned about the
 
05:02:36.590 --> 05:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
peace about um child care and the um
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
adherence to Federal block grant
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
requirements we understanded that it
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
would require the programs to collect
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
the vaccination Pro uh data if the
 
05:02:48.910 --> 05:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
program stops collecting the data um how
 
05:02:51.310 --> 05:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
will they know you know how will they be
 
05:02:52.990 --> 05:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
able to warport it they will not be
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate in these Child
 
05:02:57.590 --> 05:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
Care scholarships um and I just want to
 
05:02:59.150 --> 05:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
make a note that the child care crisis
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as we know has worsened
 
05:03:04.548 --> 05:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
since covid in 2023 new features
 
05:03:06.070 --> 05:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
Champion the child care for New
 
05:03:07.708 --> 05:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Working Families act which
 
05:03:09.910 --> 05:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
modernized the New Hampshire Child Care
 
05:03:13.548 --> 05:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs got $6.5 million in
 
05:03:15.868 --> 05:03:15.878 align:start position:0%
the budget to ensure that families
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
qualify for scholarships so if hwe 1213
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
passes we would be concerned to be
 
05:03:23.948 --> 05:03:23.958 align:start position:0%
taking a step back from the progress
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
achieved in really improving Child Care
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
access in the state um with that said we
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
would oppose um House Bill 1213 we ask
 
05:03:35.070 --> 05:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
you to vote and expedient to
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you questions
 
05:03:40.750 --> 05:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
05:03:42.190 --> 05:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you it's good to see
 
05:03:44.830 --> 05:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
you again here nice uh I may have missed
 
05:03:46.110 --> 05:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
this when I was trying to listen to your
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
testimony did you just say that we're
 
05:03:49.548 --> 05:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
spending $60 million so that we can
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
receive federal grants for child care or
 
05:03:53.868 --> 05:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
did I miss one of the details in that so
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
we have additional General funds so we
 
05:03:58.390 --> 05:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
can leverage for their federal funds to
 
05:04:01.470 --> 05:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
expand Child Care scholarship programs
 
05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
to reduce the rates for families for
 
05:04:07.270 --> 05:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
child care so this is what uh one of the
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
accomplishments we were able to make in
 
05:04:11.628 --> 05:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
the budget to really improve access to
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
child care in the state so our concern
 
05:04:16.510 --> 05:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
with this bill is um one of the
 
05:04:18.990 --> 05:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
requirements is to collect um
 
05:04:20.910 --> 05:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates if we're not
 
05:04:22.830 --> 05:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
collecting vaccination rates that will
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
put the federal funds at Jeopardy um
 
05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and as a follow up um I
 
05:04:30.628 --> 05:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
sorry as um could you provide the other
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements that are coming
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
from that money because I just want to
 
05:04:35.670 --> 05:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're balancing these
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
needs and do you see anywhere in here
 
05:04:39.390 --> 05:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
that prohibits the child care agencies
 
05:04:41.708 --> 05:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
from still collecting these records I
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
guess my concern is while I explicitly
 
05:04:46.868 --> 05:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
don't see it I don't see anything that I
 
05:04:48.510 --> 05:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
mean how will they know what their rates
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
are if they don't collect this
 
05:04:52.590 --> 05:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
information and how will we know that's
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
accurate information if there's nothing
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
in the statute that dictates they do so
 
05:04:59.708 --> 05:04:59.718 align:start position:0%
I guess they can collect it voluntarily
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
but um the concern would be you know
 
05:05:04.548 --> 05:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
whether that information is accurate and
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
then we also lose the public health um
 
05:05:09.548 --> 05:05:09.558 align:start position:0%
reasons why that information is
 
05:05:11.510 --> 05:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
important to collect as the department
 
05:05:14.590 --> 05:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
had said earlier regarding
 
05:05:17.708 --> 05:05:17.718 align:start position:0%
outbreaks representative Shapero thank
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
05:05:20.788 --> 05:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
this question I really missed my
 
05:05:22.350 --> 05:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity when the person from the
 
05:05:23.948 --> 05:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
Department was testifying but you're
 
05:05:27.510 --> 05:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
smart so maybe you know um do you know
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
what percentage of daycare centers um
 
05:05:34.548 --> 05:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
accept accept these scholarships I don't
 
05:05:36.110 --> 05:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head cuz I'm not the
 
05:05:38.270 --> 05:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
Child Care Agency or Child Care expert
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
at new Futures but I can get that
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
information to you and and follow up
 
05:05:45.470 --> 05:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
follow up and do home daycares take
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
these as well I believe home dayc carees
 
05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
but I would defer to the department on
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
that I will say that many of the child
 
05:05:54.350 --> 05:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
care providers we work with are in
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill because they are
 
05:05:57.628 --> 05:05:57.638 align:start position:0%
concerned how it will impact their
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
scholarships okay thank you other
 
05:06:03.868 --> 05:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nagel thank you
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
question and again as representative
 
05:06:09.788 --> 05:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
Shapiro had just said you're sitting in
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
the wrong place at the wrong time so
 
05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
I'll address this to you um I'm a boots
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
on the ground doctor but I've also been
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
involved in policy development at the
 
05:06:21.070 --> 05:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
local Regional National levels and
 
05:06:23.310 --> 05:06:23.320 align:start position:0%
what's driving me crazy in looking at
 
05:06:25.948 --> 05:06:25.958 align:start position:0%
bills over and over and over again is
 
05:06:28.030 --> 05:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
everything is just another form it's
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
just one more form and I I understand
 
05:06:33.750 --> 05:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
the need for data but the problem is is
 
05:06:35.910 --> 05:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
that data adversely affects our ability
 
05:06:38.350 --> 05:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
to do our job and I think that's what's
 
05:06:41.430 --> 05:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
driving this bill and we deal with a
 
05:06:43.070 --> 05:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
thing that used to be called meaningful
 
05:06:45.788 --> 05:06:45.798 align:start position:0%
list um use in medicine that's now
 
05:06:47.948 --> 05:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
called some um managing interoperability
 
05:06:50.750 --> 05:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
or something it's really adversing
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
affecting our ability to do our job and
 
05:06:55.390 --> 05:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
and we need to find better strategies on
 
05:06:57.670 --> 05:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
how to satisfy your needs to collect
 
05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
data and our needs to do our job for the
 
05:07:02.430 --> 05:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
people we care for and I'm just curious
 
05:07:04.548 --> 05:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
if you have any thought if number one do
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
you understand that and number two is do
 
05:07:08.230 --> 05:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
you have any creative strategies that
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
can help solve that dilemma especially
 
05:07:12.990 --> 05:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
for small providers and small schools so
 
05:07:14.230 --> 05:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
again I'm not uh thank you for the
 
05:07:16.670 --> 05:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
question um I'm not a child care expert
 
05:07:18.750 --> 05:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
but I will say that this information has
 
05:07:21.948 --> 05:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
been collected for some time we have not
 
05:07:23.628 --> 05:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
I think through our circle of providers
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
have heard concerns about it it's what's
 
05:07:25.920 --> 05:07:26.750 align:start position:0%
have heard concerns about it it's what's
been

05:07:26.750 --> 05:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:07:30.670 --> 05:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
collected um I do think the idea behind
 
05:07:33.390 --> 05:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
expanding um the scholarship programs
 
05:07:35.070 --> 05:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
and the money going to child care
 
05:07:38.830 --> 05:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
agencies hopefully can offer to um
 
05:07:40.910 --> 05:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
offset some of those costs in some way
 
05:07:43.350 --> 05:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
if there's an easier way to do it but I
 
05:07:45.230 --> 05:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
do at the end of the day really believe
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
that that public health information is
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
really important to run a child care
 
05:07:53.948 --> 05:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
business other
 
05:07:56.670 --> 05:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative Missour
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:08:01.390 --> 05:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
my question uh so we've heard it before
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
but I I again I'm just clarifying in
 
05:08:06.230 --> 05:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
your opinion does this bill prevent
 
05:08:08.670 --> 05:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
child care in um agencies from
 
05:08:12.270 --> 05:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
collecting this data does it prevent
 
05:08:16.590 --> 05:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
them I mean I would it says here that it
 
05:08:19.708 --> 05:08:19.718 align:start position:0%
such records um public schools and child
 
05:08:21.948 --> 05:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
care AG you shall make an it it
 
05:08:24.150 --> 05:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from making an annual
 
05:08:26.708 --> 05:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
report I guess if they're not making an
 
05:08:28.750 --> 05:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
annual report are they collecting that
 
05:08:30.868 --> 05:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
information I think it just makes it
 
05:08:33.708 --> 05:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
unclear I would have concerns about that
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
and how can they report to um regarding
 
05:08:37.708 --> 05:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
the federal dollars if they don't have
 
05:08:41.150 --> 05:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
that um accurate information followup
 
05:08:43.350 --> 05:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
followup thank you you also um we also
 
05:08:45.310 --> 05:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
talked before you said about you know
 
05:08:47.350 --> 05:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
skewing the data if they don't if it's
 
05:08:51.030 --> 05:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
not collected but there could be a lot
 
05:08:54.750 --> 05:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
of medical exemptions existing with all
 
05:08:56.548 --> 05:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
of these different childcare industries
 
05:08:57.948 --> 05:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
that are currently collecting this
 
05:08:59.868 --> 05:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
information that are actually skewing
 
05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
the data so how would how would this
 
05:09:05.070 --> 05:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
change yeah my understanding about
 
05:09:07.708 --> 05:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
exemption rates are that they pretty low
 
05:09:09.190 --> 05:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
in this state I deferred to the
 
05:09:10.708 --> 05:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
department on that so I'm not sure how
 
05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
much that would scale yeah I would like
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
I would like actual data on that as well
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you other
 
05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%

05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
director of advocacy with the national
 
05:10:34.030 --> 05:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine information center I'm here to
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
testify in support of House Bill
 
05:10:39.030 --> 05:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
1213 please take note that the analysis
 
05:10:41.948 --> 05:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
statement for this bill is not correct
 
05:10:43.708 --> 05:10:43.718 align:start position:0%
this bill makes no vaccination
 
05:10:45.430 --> 05:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for public school children
 
05:10:46.948 --> 05:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
nor does it change any of the
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements nor does it
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
remove any requirements what this bill
 
05:10:52.948 --> 05:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
actually does is remove certain
 
05:10:55.150 --> 05:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
reporting burdens on private schools and
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
daycares and it also provides important
 
05:10:59.270 --> 05:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
privacy protections that align with
 
05:11:01.230 --> 05:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
privacy protections relative to
 
05:11:03.390 --> 05:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination elsewhere in State Statute
 
05:11:03.400 --> 05:11:04.150 align:start position:0%
vaccination elsewhere in State Statute
and

05:11:04.150 --> 05:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:06.548 --> 05:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
rules I wish to point out the separate
 
05:11:08.470 --> 05:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
immunization requirement provision the
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement provision and the exemption
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions in State Statute and you
 
05:11:15.070 --> 05:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
touched on it representative Nagel
 
05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
earlier you are correct there is the
 
05:11:19.270 --> 05:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
immunization requirement provision
 
05:11:23.230 --> 05:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
that's RSA 141 c20a Roman numeral 1 and
 
05:11:26.110 --> 05:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
let me read that one for you it requires
 
05:11:28.190 --> 05:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
that and I quote all parents or legal
 
05:11:29.548 --> 05:11:29.558 align:start position:0%
Guardians shall have their children who
 
05:11:31.750 --> 05:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
are residing in the State immunized
 
05:11:33.310 --> 05:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
against against certain diseases these
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
diseases shall include but not be
 
05:11:37.390 --> 05:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
limited to diptheria Ms protestas
 
05:11:40.110 --> 05:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
politis rebell robiola and tetanus the
 
05:11:42.190 --> 05:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall adopt rules under RSA
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
541a relative to other diseases which
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
shall require immunization period that's
 
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
the end then there is the enforcement
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
provision in State Statute which is RSA
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
141 c22a Roman numo 2 and that's in this
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
bill so I won't read it for
 
05:12:01.310 --> 05:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
you but I want you to note that this
 
05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
provision enforcement provision is using
 
05:12:05.190 --> 05:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
schools and daycare agencies as the
 
05:12:07.670 --> 05:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism for the very broad
 
05:12:09.990 --> 05:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
immunization requirement I just read
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
please do not confuse the broad
 
05:12:14.110 --> 05:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
requirement with the limited enforcement
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism then there is the separate
 
05:12:18.070 --> 05:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
provision the exemption provision that's
 
05:12:19.910 --> 05:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 141
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
c20c exemptions and that provides two
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
exemptions one is a medical exemption I
 
05:12:27.270 --> 05:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
will not read um you can refer to that
 
05:12:29.590 --> 05:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
and the other one Roman num a parent or
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
legal guardian objects to immunization
 
05:12:33.548 --> 05:12:33.558 align:start position:0%
because because of religious beliefs the
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
parent or legal Guardians shall sign a
 
05:12:37.230 --> 05:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
form stating that the child has not been
 
05:12:40.190 --> 05:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
immunized because of religious beliefs
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
period I want you to note this exemption
 
05:12:44.670 --> 05:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
provision is a separate section of RSA
 
05:12:48.030 --> 05:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
141 C20 and is broadly stated there is
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
nothing in this provision that ties it
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
to schools or dayc carees it applies to
 
05:12:53.708 --> 05:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
all children in the state whether
 
05:12:55.150 --> 05:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
they're in a public school a private
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
school a daycare and no school or
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
daycare wherever there is an attempt at
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
the immunization enforcement provision
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
it is a very broad protection some
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
additional considerations in this bill
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
is that there's concern if a daycare
 
05:13:10.350 --> 05:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
school is not an enforcer that they
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
won't accept all exemptions provided in
 
05:13:15.788 --> 05:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
statute and may deny entry again these
 
05:13:17.628 --> 05:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
exemptions apply to all children in the
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
state regardless of where they are
 
05:13:21.548 --> 05:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
situated it would be unwise for any
 
05:13:23.628 --> 05:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
private business to deny access based on
 
05:13:26.350 --> 05:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
a parent use of a statutory vaccination
 
05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
exemption is it would put the school or
 
05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
business at Great risk of civil rights
 
05:13:32.430 --> 05:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
action against the organization parents
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
in the state of Mississippi won a
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
religious exemption this past year when
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
a Federal Court ruled that the state
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
cannot afford a secular exemption which
 
05:13:41.628 --> 05:13:41.638 align:start position:0%
is the medical without affording a
 
05:13:43.470 --> 05:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
religious exemption because doing so
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
violated the First Amendment finally
 
05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
there are other good Provisions in this
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
bill it will protect individual students
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
from the prying eyes of state government
 
05:13:54.750 --> 05:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
this provision protects individuals from
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
having their private individual
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
immunization records viewed and perhaps
 
05:14:01.190 --> 05:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
copied by DHHS this aligns with the
 
05:14:03.070 --> 05:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
privacy protections relative to the
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
vaccination registry the government is
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
not authorized to view or obtain medical
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
maintain individual vaccination records
 
05:14:12.270 --> 05:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
without specific individual written
 
05:14:14.430 --> 05:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
consent I dare say that any parent who
 
05:14:16.270 --> 05:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
submits a vaccination records to the
 
05:14:19.788 --> 05:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
daycare is under no impression that DHHS
 
05:14:21.390 --> 05:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
will be Marching In and looking at those
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
records I hope this bill will have your
 
05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
full support I'm happy to take any
 
05:14:28.788 --> 05:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Nagel
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
my question I just have a question that
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
you may or may not know the answer to
 
05:14:36.350 --> 05:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
when the data is reported and I know
 
05:14:38.270 --> 05:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
there's rules that had to be developed
 
05:14:40.708 --> 05:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
is the data reported electronically by
 
05:14:42.788 --> 05:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
paper is there a requirement of any kind
 
05:14:45.030 --> 05:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
on how it has to be reported I don't
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
know how it's reported If It's Paper
 
05:14:49.150 --> 05:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
electronic but the the bill is and the
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
Privacy protection it's removing is um
 
05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
the provision um it's on line 10 of the
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill such records shall be available for
 
05:14:58.910 --> 05:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
inspection during reasonable hours upon
 
05:15:01.390 --> 05:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
request by the commissioner's design
 
05:15:03.750 --> 05:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
which certainly indicates that they
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
records you all set representative Nagel
 
05:15:14.070 --> 05:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
or okay okay thank you for the question
 
05:15:15.750 --> 05:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:15:22.708 --> 05:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
you no one else has uh signed up to
 
05:15:27.990 --> 05:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
testify on hb1 1213
 
05:15:36.868 --> 05:15:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:40.548 --> 05:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
gabble thank you representative
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:53.590 --> 05:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
recognized sorry about that I was
 
05:15:55.070 --> 05:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
holding on to
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
it so representative Kelly Patza
 
05:16:00.548 --> 05:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
straford District 19 uh just speaking in
 
05:16:02.548 --> 05:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I don't have too
 
05:16:05.150 --> 05:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
too much to say except for I want to
 
05:16:07.548 --> 05:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
speak on the private school aspect to
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
kind of answer representative um palmo
 
05:16:10.920 --> 05:16:12.190 align:start position:0%
kind of answer representative um palmo
Chan

05:16:12.190 --> 05:16:12.200 align:start position:0%
Chan
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
so my my kids have attended private
 
05:16:19.230 --> 05:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
school for gosh 10 years now so
 
05:16:23.070 --> 05:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
um at least that right uh so in all the
 
05:16:25.030 --> 05:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
schools that they've attended you have
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
to provide you know an updated physical
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
and so my children were of course uh um
 
05:16:35.430 --> 05:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
patients for Dartmouth Hitchcock and so
 
05:16:39.150 --> 05:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
automatically on their physical form it
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
it automatically attaches the
 
05:16:43.628 --> 05:16:43.638 align:start position:0%
immunization records the school that
 
05:16:47.430 --> 05:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
they're currently at um this just re
 
05:16:50.430 --> 05:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
kind of speaks to the Privacy issue and
 
05:16:54.590 --> 05:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
my daughter was able to log in to see
 
05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
all her you know her medical records
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
right there but it it wasn't really
 
05:17:01.470 --> 05:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
locked down because they have a you know
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
they have an electronic portal so that
 
05:17:06.628 --> 05:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
was a little concerning to me um more so
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's automatically the the immunization
 
05:17:10.670 --> 05:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
records are attached to her current
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
physical so that's usually happening and
 
05:17:15.750 --> 05:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
I don't I can't see that being different
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
for pretty most most of the parents that
 
05:17:21.868 --> 05:17:21.878 align:start position:0%
are submitting information so and I also
 
05:17:24.670 --> 05:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
believe that this this bill like it says
 
05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
it's not um it's not uh stopping it
 
05:17:31.910 --> 05:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
prohibiting it as well so it's making it
 
05:17:34.990 --> 05:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
an option um in private businesses need
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
to be I think private businesses it's
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
different than the public and then in
 
05:17:40.708 --> 05:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
regards with this the scholarship piece
 
05:17:42.628 --> 05:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
which was interesting if they need that
 
05:17:45.070 --> 05:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
information to be able to get um a
 
05:17:46.590 --> 05:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship why wouldn't they just be
 
05:17:48.548 --> 05:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
able to get that from the from the
 
05:17:50.430 --> 05:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
families that are applying for those
 
05:17:52.430 --> 05:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship funds directly why would
 
05:17:54.670 --> 05:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
that have to be provided to by a daycare
 
05:17:57.910 --> 05:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
center or another entity like that um
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
and then in regards to a question that
 
05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
was asked asked by representative Paula
 
05:18:06.070 --> 05:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
it it it talks about DHS and and they
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
that they don't purchase vaccines so
 
05:18:10.390 --> 05:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
let's just be clear DHHS purchases
 
05:18:14.070 --> 05:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines from the CDC so this year alone
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
DHHS will ask for uh over $25 million to
 
05:18:20.230 --> 05:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
be paid to them through the vaccine
 
05:18:23.070 --> 05:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
Association to pay for these vaccines so
 
05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to be clear about that but
 
05:18:27.510 --> 05:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
I fully support this bill and um I hope
 
05:18:28.830 --> 05:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
you will
 
05:18:32.548 --> 05:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
too any questions
 
05:18:36.070 --> 05:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
you okay I don't I know of no one else
 
05:18:41.310 --> 05:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
I'm planning to testify I have no other
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
pink cards no one else has signed up uh
 
05:18:45.548 --> 05:18:45.558 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet in the back where you can
 
05:18:47.670 --> 05:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
sign up just to uh indicate your opinion
 
05:18:48.830 --> 05:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
one way or the other if you're not
 
05:18:52.190 --> 05:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
speaking has seven in favor two opposed
 
05:18:55.548 --> 05:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
and one neutral party and on line uh
 
05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
what did we have online um online we had
 
05:19:00.750 --> 05:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
74 supporting and 69 opposing when I
 
05:19:02.190 --> 05:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
pulled it up
 
05:19:06.670 --> 05:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
earlier okay thank you okay it is now a
 
05:19:08.788 --> 05:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
little past 2:45 so I'm going to close

you good afternoon
committee

05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
I'm being joined with John Bodwin J I'm
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:13.230 --> 05:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
25 John Bowman is a knowledgeable
 
05:20:15.910 --> 05:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
individual on this bill he helped write
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
most of it this is relative to
 
05:20:20.548 --> 05:20:20.558 align:start position:0%
immunization reporting requirements and
 
05:20:22.110 --> 05:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
this bill requires death certificates to
 
05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
record certain information regarding
 
05:20:25.910 --> 05:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
immunizations received by The Descendant
 
05:20:27.070 --> 05:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
the bill also establishes certain
 
05:20:28.070 --> 05:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements for the
 
05:20:29.390 --> 05:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:20:35.150 --> 05:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hand it off to John for the
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
time being and we'll just switch back
 
05:20:41.510 --> 05:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
and forth but he has a handout that was
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
passed around that if you'd like to
 
05:20:46.990 --> 05:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
address and take it on thank you thank
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
you very
 
05:20:50.310 --> 05:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
much thanks for having me guys
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate being here um
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
so this bill is is unique in the entire
 
05:20:59.390 --> 05:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
country uh what it's doing is allowing
 
05:21:01.590 --> 05:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
the people access to the data that
 
05:21:03.070 --> 05:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
belongs to the people which is the
 
05:21:05.830 --> 05:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
health of the state so I'm just going to
 
05:21:07.230 --> 05:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
start going through the handout a little
 
05:21:08.670 --> 05:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
bit because it'll it'll lend some
 
05:21:11.430 --> 05:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
structure to uh how you perceive the
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
data there was a an estimate of
 
05:21:17.230 --> 05:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
$160,000 that was done by New Hampshire
 
05:21:19.110 --> 05:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
with regard to this bill uh it doesn't
 
05:21:21.310 --> 05:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
seem as though they looked at the other
 
05:21:24.070 --> 05:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
column where it would save probably more
 
05:21:26.548 --> 05:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
than a million dollars a year for the
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
state can't really talk about that in a
 
05:21:30.670 --> 05:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
in a short time here so anybody is
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
welcome to contact me and I can go
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
through any financial analysis and also
 
05:21:38.830 --> 05:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
point out the flaws in the 160k so uh
 
05:21:41.548 --> 05:21:41.558 align:start position:0%
hb1 1661 would be a net budget reduction
 
05:21:43.270 --> 05:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Public Health um
 
05:21:44.868 --> 05:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
it would save lives that's the most
 
05:21:46.708 --> 05:21:46.718 align:start position:0%
important thing save New Hampshire lives
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
and provide a better functioning
 
05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health and keep
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
them on Mission which is to uh for the
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
health and safety of New Hampshire
 
05:21:58.150 --> 05:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
citizens without the bill the truth
 
05:21:59.590 --> 05:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
remains hidden from the
 
05:22:02.670 --> 05:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
people public confidence in dph will wne
 
05:22:05.190 --> 05:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
as more people die which which has been
 
05:22:08.590 --> 05:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
happening and uh people prescribed
 
05:22:10.990 --> 05:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
medicines that were um recommended by
 
05:22:12.230 --> 05:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
the government and I don't mean New
 
05:22:14.350 --> 05:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not necessarily people who
 
05:22:18.430 --> 05:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
rely on the CDC and FDA for uh what is
 
05:22:21.868 --> 05:22:21.878 align:start position:0%
safe and effective they've been let down
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh many have been let down so let's talk
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
about one specific cause it's it's it's
 
05:22:30.110 --> 05:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
the code is D68 but these are other
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
clotting defects
 
05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
what you have here on this page these
 
05:22:36.310 --> 05:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire residents who died in
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I have all the
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts death records it would be
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
illegal for me to have New Hampshire
 
05:22:44.510 --> 05:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
records of the same type but I have
 
05:22:47.510 --> 05:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
these legally from Massachusetts and of
 
05:22:49.788 --> 05:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
ketris parabis all other things being
 
05:22:52.830 --> 05:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
equal you see the bar of 2021 being very
 
05:22:54.670 --> 05:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
high when it comes to clot
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
defects and uh one gentleman Martin from
 
05:22:59.548 --> 05:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
summersworth he was 47 years old died
 
05:23:02.510 --> 05:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
with multiorgan failure stroke
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
hypercoagulability that's hyper clotting
 
05:23:06.390 --> 05:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden the guy started hyper
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
clotting all in days he did not have a
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
history of
 
05:23:12.670 --> 05:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
this cardiac
 
05:23:15.350 --> 05:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
amiloidosis which is a known condition
 
05:23:19.390 --> 05:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
from covid gene therapy injections it's
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
known to happen so I I don't know when
 
05:23:24.390 --> 05:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
he got his vaccine this could be
 
05:23:26.430 --> 05:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
correlated and we don't have to let
 
05:23:28.590 --> 05:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
private information out what this bill
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
does is
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
it makes sure that the public knows the
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
correlation of the immunizations to the
 
05:23:38.590 --> 05:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
health outcomes which the people should
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
should know and have a right to know uh
 
05:23:42.910 --> 05:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
with anemias there's thomy toena
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
inability to clot there uh lucenia
 
05:23:48.910 --> 05:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
neutropenia um the example here is FBR
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
neutropenia in
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
hours acute myoid leukemia AML that's
 
05:23:56.030 --> 05:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
also a signal that's been growing very
 
05:23:58.150 --> 05:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
strong since Co
 
05:24:00.548 --> 05:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
immunizations and you see that 21 and 22
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
are Al very high for New Hampshire
 
05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
residents who died in Massachusetts
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals only again 21 and
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
22 uh this is sudden kidney
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
failure it's also called acute renal
 
05:24:17.590 --> 05:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
failure this is probably the biggest
 
05:24:19.708 --> 05:24:19.718 align:start position:0%
epidemic of single deaths since 1918
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
1919 and nobody's talking about it the
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
CDC knows this they have to know this
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
100,000 excess Americans died involving
 
05:24:30.910 --> 05:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
acute renal failure in 21 and 22 and
 
05:24:33.150 --> 05:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
very many in 2023 and the exact time
 
05:24:35.310 --> 05:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
that it started happening was 2 weeks
 
05:24:37.868 --> 05:24:37.878 align:start position:0%
after November 2nd which is cms.gov
 
05:24:39.670 --> 05:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
where the
 
05:24:42.670 --> 05:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
nctap which is the incentive 20% of the
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
entire hospital bill gets paid from the
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
federal government they get a bonus the
 
05:24:49.150 --> 05:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals get a bonus the doctors get a
 
05:24:51.750 --> 05:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
bonus for using REM Desir baricitinib
 
05:24:54.270 --> 05:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:56.788 --> 05:24:56.798 align:start position:0%
medicines that's that's a big one so
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
Joseph was 30 years old multi-stem organ
 
05:25:02.390 --> 05:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
failure in days pneumonia flu stafilic
 
05:25:04.910 --> 05:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
cacus orius and sudden kidney failure he
 
05:25:06.788 --> 05:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
was from Franklin New
 
05:25:09.670 --> 05:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire clots in the brain that cause
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
Strokes you see that 2022 is almost
 
05:25:14.310 --> 05:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
double actually it's almost triple some
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the other
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
years Jeffrey was 53 years old died from
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
a stroke in days hypercoagulable in
 
05:25:22.920 --> 05:25:24.470 align:start position:0%
a stroke in days hypercoagulable in
months

05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
months
 
05:25:27.230 --> 05:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
again very hyper
 
05:25:30.230 --> 05:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
clotting intraventricular Hemorrhage and
 
05:25:33.628 --> 05:25:33.638 align:start position:0%
then El was 61 years old she died from a
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
cerebral herniation another kind of
 
05:25:38.548 --> 05:25:38.558 align:start position:0%
stroke multifocal cerebral infarcts and
 
05:25:40.510 --> 05:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
a bonus of an aortic dissection her
 
05:25:42.948 --> 05:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
aorta blew apart those are also very
 
05:25:44.910 --> 05:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
high since the vaccine if you want to
 
05:25:46.510 --> 05:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
call it a
 
05:25:50.110 --> 05:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine and lastly for these uh this set
 
05:25:53.070 --> 05:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
is clots in lungs in Massachusetts
 
05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's more than 500 excess pulmonary
 
05:25:58.548 --> 05:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
embolism deaths in 21 and 22 alone
 
05:26:01.470 --> 05:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
500 and I've correlated many them with
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge of their vaccination dates now
 
05:26:06.150 --> 05:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you see that 2021 is
 
05:26:06.160 --> 05:26:06.910 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you see that 2021 is
very

05:26:06.910 --> 05:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:26:10.750 --> 05:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
high Lindsay was only 27 years old from
 
05:26:13.310 --> 05:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
Newton New Hampshire died August 4th
 
05:26:15.788 --> 05:26:15.798 align:start position:0%
pulmonary thrombo Emile and deep bin
 
05:26:17.948 --> 05:26:17.958 align:start position:0%
thrombosis those are usually in the calf
 
05:26:19.708 --> 05:26:19.718 align:start position:0%
and they they call it throwing a clot
 
05:26:21.510 --> 05:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
right it breaks off it travels to your
 
05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
lung and then you can die and she did I
 
05:26:27.910 --> 05:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't know our vaccination date but this
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
bill would force that analysis to be
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
done and that analysis is not being done
 
05:26:35.788 --> 05:26:35.798 align:start position:0%
by any government at this time why it's
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know purposeful inaction
 
05:26:40.390 --> 05:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
omission of conduct where there's a
 
05:26:41.910 --> 05:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
legal duty to act and they should be
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
doing this so this this public oversight
 
05:26:46.990 --> 05:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
in this bill would be the best in the
 
05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
nation also Jeffrey was 30 years old
 
05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
from eping New Hampshire cardiogenic
 
05:26:55.350 --> 05:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
shock it says massive pulmonary embolism
 
05:26:58.390 --> 05:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
in 6 hours he also had brain cancer in 8
 
05:27:01.910 --> 05:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
months another signal known from the VAC
 
05:27:04.590 --> 05:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
and um Amy was 40 years old disseminated
 
05:27:04.600 --> 05:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
and um Amy was 40 years old disseminated
intravascular

05:27:05.990 --> 05:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
intravascular
 
05:27:08.948 --> 05:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
coagulation all through her body coagula
 
05:27:10.750 --> 05:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
and cloths all through her body and a
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
pulmonary embolism and
 
05:27:17.910 --> 05:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
DBT now I I do write U on I write a
 
05:27:20.670 --> 05:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
substack u probably two or three times a
 
05:27:24.230 --> 05:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
month so I a journalist as a journalist
 
05:27:26.270 --> 05:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
and a member of the press people
 
05:27:27.830 --> 05:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
approach me with information from
 
05:27:30.150 --> 05:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
official sources and I won't divulge it
 
05:27:31.990 --> 05:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
if I don't don't think it's real but if
 
05:27:34.628 --> 05:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
I check it out yeah I will so I'm going
 
05:27:36.030 --> 05:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
to share some here
 
05:27:38.070 --> 05:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
today this information regarding the
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
health of the people of New Hampshire
 
05:27:41.350 --> 05:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
should not have to have been acquired as
 
05:27:44.110 --> 05:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
I've done the data belongs to the people
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
not the government the government is of
 
05:27:48.788 --> 05:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
the people here are some facts people
 
05:27:51.070 --> 05:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
would have known if Bill 1661 was in
 
05:27:52.390 --> 05:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
place years
 
05:27:55.350 --> 05:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
ago at least 87 people when I say at
 
05:27:57.270 --> 05:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
least it's because the data I have is
 
05:27:59.310 --> 05:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
only a subset of people from New
 
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a small subset
 
05:28:03.750 --> 05:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
87 people died in New Hampshire within 3
 
05:28:05.230 --> 05:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
days of Co
 
05:28:07.750 --> 05:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
immunization at least 50 died within two
 
05:28:11.430 --> 05:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
days of immunization New Hampshire 24
 
05:28:14.470 --> 05:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
died on the day of or the day after
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
immunization the next 11 people died on
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
the same day New Hampshire of
 
05:28:23.110 --> 05:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
immunization Rodney Lucas was 62 Barbara
 
05:28:27.190 --> 05:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
Jenkins 68 Amy Thomas 72 Daniel Cheney
 
05:28:27.200 --> 05:28:27.948 align:start position:0%
Jenkins 68 Amy Thomas 72 Daniel Cheney
was

05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:28:32.788 --> 05:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
76 an kazak 76 7 Louise Fontaine 81
 
05:28:35.830 --> 05:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
margarit timage 83 Roger pinchard 83
 
05:28:39.628 --> 05:28:39.638 align:start position:0%
Katherine DS 84 Sheila green 85 may you
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
just give the ages and not the names
 
05:28:42.910 --> 05:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
since you have last names there for
 
05:28:47.150 --> 05:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
privacy okay sorry I I finished
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
actually um and that is that is the
 
05:28:52.948 --> 05:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
problem in that do we want to keep
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
secret from the people things that are
 
05:28:57.628 --> 05:28:57.638 align:start position:0%
killing the
 
05:29:00.390 --> 05:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
people I mean the point is the the
 
05:29:02.470 --> 05:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
health and safety of the public and so
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know they all died on the same day
 
05:29:06.190 --> 05:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
of immunization and I'll I'll skip the
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
last name for the the others but so Anna
 
05:29:11.150 --> 05:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
Tucker was 26 years
 
05:29:14.670 --> 05:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
old Anna died one day after
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
immunization her obituary says passed
 
05:29:20.708 --> 05:29:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
sleep first name is going to give this
 
05:29:26.750 --> 05:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
guy away stu um it's a unique name 35
 
05:29:28.830 --> 05:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
years old died on Christmas Eve 2 days
 
05:29:31.590 --> 05:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
after immunization unexpectedly
 
05:29:35.868 --> 05:29:35.878 align:start position:0%
ly Robert died March 19 2022 4 days
 
05:29:37.708 --> 05:29:37.718 align:start position:0%
after immunization of matching V's
 
05:29:37.718 --> 05:29:39.430 align:start position:0%
after immunization of matching V's
report

05:29:39.430 --> 05:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
report
 
05:29:39.440 --> 05:29:41.030 align:start position:0%
report
221082

05:29:41.030 --> 05:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
221082
 
05:29:43.750 --> 05:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
report mentions
 
05:29:45.628 --> 05:29:45.638 align:start position:0%
cardiomyopathy because they gave an
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
immunization to a guy with a heart
 
05:29:48.628 --> 05:29:48.638 align:start position:0%
transplant in
 
05:29:50.590 --> 05:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
2017 why would you give somebody a
 
05:29:52.070 --> 05:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
medicine for a heart he had a heart
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
transplant he also had a bone marrow
 
05:29:54.548 --> 05:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
transplant in
 
05:29:56.948 --> 05:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
20121 and if you remember I mentioned
 
05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
AML earlier he also had acute myoblastic
 
05:29:59.240 --> 05:30:01.430 align:start position:0%
AML earlier he also had acute myoblastic
leukemia

05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
leukemia
 
05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
now I know from the Massachusetts data
 
05:30:05.590 --> 05:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
and the Minnesota data I have a million
 
05:30:07.548 --> 05:30:07.558 align:start position:0%
death certificates
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
unredacted probably the only one in the
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
world outside government and if you
 
05:30:13.708 --> 05:30:13.718 align:start position:0%
haven't seen my analysis I I can send
 
05:30:15.788 --> 05:30:15.798 align:start position:0%
you a copy I have uh two books coming
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
out uh within three
 
05:30:20.670 --> 05:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
weeks so because the government refuses
 
05:30:22.670 --> 05:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
to look at this data and hides the data
 
05:30:25.590 --> 05:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
from the people very few of us know that
 
05:30:28.868 --> 05:30:28.878 align:start position:0%
AML is Common from this vaccine so is
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
lymphoma and all the blood causes on the
 
05:30:33.548 --> 05:30:33.558 align:start position:0%
trifold that I went through a moment
 
05:30:36.150 --> 05:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
moment ago all pretty common from the
 
05:30:39.510 --> 05:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines it's it's not down party
 
05:30:41.150 --> 05:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
lines you shouldn't have an Orthodoxy
 
05:30:42.990 --> 05:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
one way or the other I don't care the
 
05:30:44.548 --> 05:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
reason I looked into this is because I
 
05:30:46.110 --> 05:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
lost my son and I wasn't doing anything
 
05:30:48.270 --> 05:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
else and I'm depressed and so I just
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
want to save kids the adults can take
 
05:30:53.750 --> 05:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
take it because do your homework if you
 
05:30:55.510 --> 05:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
haven't looked into what this actually
 
05:30:58.070 --> 05:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
is and the defects in manufacturing that
 
05:31:00.270 --> 05:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
Kevin mckernan found and if you don't
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
know what I'm talking about you should
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
really look into that so I don't know
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
how many lawyers are here but
 
05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing defect is a strict
 
05:31:09.310 --> 05:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
liability standard very easy to to
 
05:31:10.670 --> 05:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
determine they didn't meet their own
 
05:31:12.270 --> 05:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
specifications and they shipped the
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
product anyway so the product has DNA
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
contamination in the form of plasmas and
 
05:31:19.470 --> 05:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not a scientist so I won't go into
 
05:31:21.390 --> 05:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
that in detail but the point is they're
 
05:31:23.990 --> 05:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
shipping contaminated product to the
 
05:31:26.070 --> 05:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
public and nobody's saying anything the
 
05:31:27.990 --> 05:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
government's just saying take it take it
 
05:31:30.788 --> 05:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
so this bill 166 you want I'm just going
 
05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
to close by
 
05:31:34.910 --> 05:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
saying it just gives transparency to the
 
05:31:36.350 --> 05:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
people and it doesn't matter what side
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're on if you believe vaccines are
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
safe and effective great this will prove
 
05:31:42.670 --> 05:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
it this will prove it it'll prove them
 
05:31:44.310 --> 05:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
safe and effective or it'll prove them
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
not safe and effective and when I say
 
05:31:47.948 --> 05:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
them some of them are going to be good
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
some of them are going to be bad because
 
05:31:51.470 --> 05:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's it also has to do with all
 
05:31:54.390 --> 05:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
medicaments not just vaccines so if if
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
rames is good or bad we'll find out if
 
05:31:58.788 --> 05:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of why aren't they
 
05:32:00.830 --> 05:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
looking at rames in combination with
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
Bank of
 
05:32:03.990 --> 05:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
meon that's that's a very strong
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
antibiotic given kind of in the end as
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
people go septic but I guess I'll just
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time I hope
 
05:32:12.750 --> 05:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
this impressed something on you and if
 
05:32:14.990 --> 05:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
you have any questions please please ask
 
05:32:17.150 --> 05:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
me because this is so important
 
05:32:18.868 --> 05:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
representative Gad do you have any thing
 
05:32:22.110 --> 05:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
to add or are you just uh just going for
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
the right no um I would just I was
 
05:32:27.150 --> 05:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
hoping John would talk briefly about the
 
05:32:29.430 --> 05:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
last part the audits I think that's key
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
transparency is the mission here because
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's been I don't I don't know what
 
05:32:34.510 --> 05:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
the right word would be but there's been
 
05:32:37.470 --> 05:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
a drop in people getting vaccinations
 
05:32:40.030 --> 05:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
because of fear and concern and so forth
 
05:32:42.910 --> 05:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
so the best way to bring back trust is
 
05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
to show the truth and this is part of it
 
05:32:47.750 --> 05:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
so if you want to speak briefly about
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
that just explain independent nature of
 
05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
it uh the the section one um it requires
 
05:32:55.430 --> 05:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
that the vaccine dates im or
 
05:32:57.110 --> 05:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
immunization any immunizations given
 
05:32:58.990 --> 05:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
within the last two years prior to dying
 
05:33:01.830 --> 05:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
be put on the D ific it's a nominal less
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
than 5 minute thing that any medical
 
05:33:07.150 --> 05:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
examiner doctor can do um the analysis
 
05:33:07.160 --> 05:33:07.910 align:start position:0%
examiner doctor can do um the analysis
of

05:33:07.910 --> 05:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:33:10.708 --> 05:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
$16,000 was was grossly exaggerated
 
05:33:11.910 --> 05:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
because all you really have to do is
 
05:33:13.788 --> 05:33:13.798 align:start position:0%
look for the number of unique names in
 
05:33:15.270 --> 05:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
the death certificate database in New
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and only those people would
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
05:33:21.548 --> 05:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
trained um let me skip to the LA it also
 
05:33:23.310 --> 05:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
forces the Department of Public Health
 
05:33:26.430 --> 05:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
to do quarterly reports which would take
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know 15 minutes to 30
 
05:33:30.190 --> 05:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
minutes you know and they put put out a
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
quarterly report it's just you write
 
05:33:33.430 --> 05:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
some scripts and you correlate two
 
05:33:35.390 --> 05:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
databases the immunization database and
 
05:33:37.150 --> 05:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
the death certificate or or Medicare if
 
05:33:40.110 --> 05:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
you want to get complicated um the last
 
05:33:43.430 --> 05:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
one though is really uh interesting I I
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
like it of course I wrote it but
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
um it allows the people to come in State
 
05:33:52.910 --> 05:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
offices and audit the data not just
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
everybody but people have to submit
 
05:33:57.708 --> 05:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
reports and of those reports four are
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
drawn by
 
05:34:02.190 --> 05:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
Lottery and the people doing the the uh
 
05:34:05.150 --> 05:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
the work cannot have been in Pharma
 
05:34:07.910 --> 05:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
industry uh any Eco Pharma ecosystem
 
05:34:11.110 --> 05:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
company or government so it allows four
 
05:34:13.230 --> 05:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
entities it could be four groups or four
 
05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
individuals or mix to come in and look
 
05:34:18.628 --> 05:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
at the data under NDA the data exists
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
for a reason it's to be studied and the
 
05:34:23.390 --> 05:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
studying of that data would provide
 
05:34:25.230 --> 05:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
invaluable information to the people
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
with regard to Public Health the reason
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
the public health department exists is
 
05:34:31.390 --> 05:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
for the safety of the the public and yet
 
05:34:32.830 --> 05:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
they're not doing anything with it
 
05:34:36.390 --> 05:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
nobody is so the the last part is is
 
05:34:39.030 --> 05:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
pretty key um it allows the people to
 
05:34:41.590 --> 05:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
have access to the data with reports and
 
05:34:43.708 --> 05:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
no one's names all privacy laws are
 
05:34:46.470 --> 05:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
adhered to there's absolutely no problem
 
05:34:48.708 --> 05:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
the only reason to be against this is if
 
05:34:50.590 --> 05:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's trying to hide something and
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
no people on both sides should be for
 
05:34:55.030 --> 05:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
this right Thank You representative
 
05:34:56.390 --> 05:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
barma you had a
 
05:34:58.628 --> 05:34:58.638 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair and
 
05:35:01.230 --> 05:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so one
 
05:35:02.990 --> 05:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
clarification I never got a bonus for
 
05:35:05.548 --> 05:35:05.558 align:start position:0%
taking for uh prescribing remes of here
 
05:35:08.948 --> 05:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
so I missed out on something um but my
 
05:35:12.470 --> 05:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
concern is um and and my question will
 
05:35:15.470 --> 05:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
follow is um I was a hospice medical
 
05:35:16.868 --> 05:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
director for about 30 years so I filled
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
out a lot of death certificates and I
 
05:35:21.948 --> 05:35:21.958 align:start position:0%
rarely would have had the information on
 
05:35:24.590 --> 05:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinations because a lot of the times
 
05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
a patient will have shown up at our
 
05:35:29.708 --> 05:35:29.718 align:start position:0%
hospital I won't have the Rec Rec
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
records for that and obtaining them
 
05:35:33.670 --> 05:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
would be very difficult and I and I
 
05:35:35.350 --> 05:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
still would probably not know for
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
example if they got a CO vaccination at
 
05:35:40.510 --> 05:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
a pharmacy it it wouldn't be there so it
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
would be very hard to collect this data
 
05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you um did any research on
 
05:35:47.430 --> 05:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
that and how that might be made easier
 
05:35:48.948 --> 05:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
because it would be really I mean it
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
would have it would take me hours to
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
find that I can explain that yeah so in
 
05:35:56.390 --> 05:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
fact in that analysis of the $160,000
 
05:35:57.750 --> 05:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is they're talking
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
about how long it would take to train
 
05:36:01.590 --> 05:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
doctors to have access to the New
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire immunization information
 
05:36:05.430 --> 05:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
system which exists and that that's a
 
05:36:07.910 --> 05:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
registry of all the vaccinations people
 
05:36:10.030 --> 05:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
have gotten if they didn't want it you
 
05:36:12.470 --> 05:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
know uh there is a box you can check for
 
05:36:14.430 --> 05:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
it to be redacted and in the case where
 
05:36:15.948 --> 05:36:15.958 align:start position:0%
it's not there it's not there but in
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
case where it is there it would require
 
05:36:20.150 --> 05:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
a doctor to look it up and that that
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
would be like less than a five minute
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
thing you just go into the nhi
 
05:36:27.670 --> 05:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
IIs you log in and you'd probably
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
already be logged in if you're doing
 
05:36:30.310 --> 05:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
death certificates if you're a medical
 
05:36:31.948 --> 05:36:31.958 align:start position:0%
examiner but if it's a doctor you're
 
05:36:33.390 --> 05:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
probably talking you know if somebody
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
dies in the in the presence of a doctor
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
attending uh that's when a doctor fills
 
05:36:39.430 --> 05:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
out the Des certificate and in that case
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
it depends you know if they work in a
 
05:36:41.708 --> 05:36:41.718 align:start position:0%
care home they're going to be doing a
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
lot of them if they're just you know
 
05:36:45.150 --> 05:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
regular family practice and somebody
 
05:36:46.830 --> 05:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
dies it's probably like once a year
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
right so you know it might take them 10
 
05:36:49.948 --> 05:36:49.958 align:start position:0%
minutes instead of five minutes it's
 
05:36:53.430 --> 05:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
really no big deal it's pretty easy to
 
05:36:55.548 --> 05:36:55.558 align:start position:0%
do representative King and then
 
05:36:57.830 --> 05:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative palazov thank you Mr
 
05:36:59.310 --> 05:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking questions I'm
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
a little
 
05:37:03.788 --> 05:37:03.798 align:start position:0%
confused what is it about Massachusetts
 
05:37:06.150 --> 05:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
that is different than New Hampshire um
 
05:37:08.510 --> 05:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
you've got some case individuals here
 
05:37:11.430 --> 05:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
and their cause of death um I guess they
 
05:37:13.548 --> 05:37:13.558 align:start position:0%
put that on their vital their Vital
 
05:37:15.070 --> 05:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
Records they they put that on their
 
05:37:16.548 --> 05:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
death certificate does New Hampshire not
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
do that does New Hampshire not put a
 
05:37:19.830 --> 05:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
cause of death or New Hampshire has a
 
05:37:21.310 --> 05:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
state law that doesn't allow me to have
 
05:37:23.990 --> 05:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
those records it's privacy there are
 
05:37:26.230 --> 05:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
certain so it's it's governed by state
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
law um it's not a privacy and death
 
05:37:31.310 --> 05:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
HIPPA violation that's federal law and
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
there's the Hippa doesn't apply to dead
 
05:37:34.548 --> 05:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
people so each state has privacy and
 
05:37:36.310 --> 05:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
many of the states have 50 years some
 
05:37:38.708 --> 05:37:38.718 align:start position:0%
have 70 years privacy and death where
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't allow me to have a
 
05:37:41.708 --> 05:37:41.718 align:start position:0%
database a full database of all the
 
05:37:44.948 --> 05:37:44.958 align:start position:0%
deant um Massachusetts apparently does
 
05:37:46.750 --> 05:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
allow me to have it and Minnesota as
 
05:37:49.350 --> 05:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
well um and Vermont we have also but
 
05:37:51.110 --> 05:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont does not have the icd10 codes
 
05:37:53.310 --> 05:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
from the CDC so it's a little different
 
05:37:55.110 --> 05:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up follow up so it's
 
05:37:57.030 --> 05:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
not on their death certificates but the
 
05:37:58.670 --> 05:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
information is available or it is on
 
05:38:00.510 --> 05:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
their death certificates
 
05:38:01.750 --> 05:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the same death
 
05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
certificates as everybody else there's
 
05:38:04.948 --> 05:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
part one and part two part one has cause
 
05:38:06.868 --> 05:38:06.878 align:start position:0%
a BCD part two has conditions
 
05:38:08.750 --> 05:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
contributing the causes are in part one
 
05:38:09.948 --> 05:38:09.958 align:start position:0%
and you should not have anything on
 
05:38:11.628 --> 05:38:11.638 align:start position:0%
there that's not causal in the causal
 
05:38:14.390 --> 05:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
chain of events that cause death however
 
05:38:16.750 --> 05:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
many of them do it wrong um you a very
 
05:38:19.470 --> 05:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
large number of doctors uh no no offense
 
05:38:21.150 --> 05:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
fill out the uh death certificates
 
05:38:23.430 --> 05:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
improperly medical examiners do a better
 
05:38:24.830 --> 05:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
job it's supposed to be in a reverse
 
05:38:26.230 --> 05:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
time order where cause a is the
 
05:38:28.030 --> 05:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
immediate cause and the last one listed
 
05:38:30.548 --> 05:38:30.558 align:start position:0%
in ABC or d whether it sometimes is only
 
05:38:33.390 --> 05:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
one filled out a sometimes it goes to D
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
but the last one is supposed to be the
 
05:38:36.990 --> 05:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
underlying cause of death or root cause
 
05:38:38.590 --> 05:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
which is the thing that started the
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
causal chain of events that caused the
 
05:38:41.868 --> 05:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
death but a lot of them do it in reverse
 
05:38:43.868 --> 05:38:43.878 align:start position:0%
time order backwards so I hope I
 
05:38:46.990 --> 05:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
answered your question yes um may I have
 
05:38:49.548 --> 05:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
one more followup one more followup okay
 
05:38:52.230 --> 05:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
um would it would it not be beneficial
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
for us to more or less copy what
 
05:38:56.190 --> 05:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does and at least allowing
 
05:38:58.030 --> 05:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
that information to be accessible like
 
05:39:00.150 --> 05:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
you currently have with Massachusetts
 
05:39:02.468 --> 05:39:02.478 align:start position:0%
um I mean that would be good but that's
 
05:39:04.030 --> 05:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
only the death death certificate
 
05:39:06.788 --> 05:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
database if if I were if I had the
 
05:39:09.628 --> 05:39:09.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts data and access to the
 
05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
immunization information registry system
 
05:39:14.830 --> 05:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
they call it it's the misis you have the
 
05:39:17.430 --> 05:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
NH in Indiana they call it chirp and
 
05:39:18.910 --> 05:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
California it's cares it's different
 
05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
acronyms but they're all the same thing
 
05:39:23.350 --> 05:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
anybody who does that I will end the
 
05:39:26.190 --> 05:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
entire debate in a week Ron DeSantis and
 
05:39:28.150 --> 05:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
Joe lpo have a proposal for me from a
 
05:39:30.270 --> 05:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago and a year ago and I
 
05:39:33.070 --> 05:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
told him the invitation is open he's
 
05:39:35.468 --> 05:39:35.478 align:start position:0%
been told by six very well-known
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
International people just just have them
 
05:39:39.788 --> 05:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
come in for a week or two you know just
 
05:39:41.390 --> 05:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
give me access all you got to do is
 
05:39:43.430 --> 05:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
correlate the two databases and debate
 
05:39:46.830 --> 05:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
ends I'll find over 10,000 people in
 
05:39:49.830 --> 05:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
Florida pretty easily thanks
 
05:39:49.840 --> 05:39:51.430 align:start position:0%
Florida pretty easily thanks
representative

05:39:51.430 --> 05:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:39:54.788 --> 05:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:39:58.510 --> 05:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I I like the idea
 
05:40:02.070 --> 05:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
of trans parency and you and and and you
 
05:40:05.468 --> 05:40:05.478 align:start position:0%
put here 10 days of close of each fiscal
 
05:40:09.468 --> 05:40:09.478 align:start position:0%
quarter so my understanding is uh uh
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
manufacturers uh they don't oppose to
 
05:40:17.310 --> 05:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
transparency they only ask for 70 years
 
05:40:20.350 --> 05:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
to be transparent about what's going on
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that new ham is
 
05:40:25.868 --> 05:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
also is not opposed to
 
05:40:30.510 --> 05:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
transparency we have DHHS uh uh visit
 
05:40:34.750 --> 05:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
portal but it shows mostly data going up
 
05:40:34.760 --> 05:40:36.390 align:start position:0%
portal but it shows mostly data going up
to

05:40:36.390 --> 05:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
2019 so my understanding is that all
 
05:40:43.990 --> 05:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
those deaths and all those uh spikes
 
05:40:46.430 --> 05:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
like an acute kidney failes and such
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be accessible to public if we
 
05:40:53.070 --> 05:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
are looking only up to
 
05:40:58.110 --> 05:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
2019 so my point is like so it usually
 
05:41:01.708 --> 05:41:01.718 align:start position:0%
takes time sometimes it's for good
 
05:41:05.190 --> 05:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
reason uh to release
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
data so what what what's what's a good
 
05:41:11.430 --> 05:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
time like let's say they say it's
 
05:41:14.548 --> 05:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
impossible to do it within 10 days like
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
would be like 6 months be a reasonable
 
05:41:23.390 --> 05:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
the time or 5 years or 70 years like
 
05:41:25.390 --> 05:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
what's reasonable yeah no I can comment
 
05:41:27.150 --> 05:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
so there's there's provisional data
 
05:41:28.628 --> 05:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
that's not been verified and that's
 
05:41:30.350 --> 05:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
usually like a year year and a half
 
05:41:32.270 --> 05:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
depending on the the jurisdiction so
 
05:41:34.150 --> 05:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
that the federal government um I can't
 
05:41:36.510 --> 05:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
remember but it's about six months when
 
05:41:40.110 --> 05:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
they say these death U the data that
 
05:41:42.390 --> 05:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
they're providing is provisional saying
 
05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
you you can't rely on it they it's
 
05:41:46.910 --> 05:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
really legal and deification the data is
 
05:41:49.310 --> 05:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
pretty good uh but what if your if your
 
05:41:51.750 --> 05:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
Public Health Department is indeed a a
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
vigilance a sentinel uh standing you
 
05:41:55.948 --> 05:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
know on the wall looking out for the
 
05:41:58.270 --> 05:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
public health they should be looking at
 
05:42:01.628 --> 05:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
it weekly you know pathogens come into
 
05:42:04.910 --> 05:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
um our society all the time I found
 
05:42:07.270 --> 05:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
things in 2018 nobody ever knew about
 
05:42:09.310 --> 05:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
there are anomalies in various causes of
 
05:42:12.510 --> 05:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
death such a system that I've created
 
05:42:14.310 --> 05:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
could potentially if you put all the
 
05:42:17.070 --> 05:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
data in there and I do all the the uh
 
05:42:18.708 --> 05:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
put all the parameters in I could tell
 
05:42:21.788 --> 05:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
you well 39 years ago in these two zip
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
codes there was an increase in B cell
 
05:42:25.708 --> 05:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
lymphocytic leukemia let's go look at
 
05:42:27.948 --> 05:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
their water supply from then we have the
 
05:42:29.310 --> 05:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
water reports from then was the there
 
05:42:31.310 --> 05:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
too much nickel or cadmium this is the
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
type of intelligence that's so easy to
 
05:42:35.670 --> 05:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
do the system I've created doesn't exist
 
05:42:37.548 --> 05:42:37.558 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the world and yet the data
 
05:42:40.430 --> 05:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
is available to the government so um you
 
05:42:42.990 --> 05:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
know representative Paul of I can't
 
05:42:45.310 --> 05:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
answer like a definitive date but if you
 
05:42:46.788 --> 05:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
have a Department of Public Health whose
 
05:42:48.990 --> 05:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
mission is the health and safety of the
 
05:42:50.990 --> 05:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
public they should be looking at it
 
05:42:53.230 --> 05:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
weekly I mean the the the reports are
 
05:42:55.788 --> 05:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
rolling in and okay if it's provisional
 
05:42:57.310 --> 05:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
that means somebody outside the
 
05:42:59.350 --> 05:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
government looking at it you're just
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
it's legal indemnification where you're
 
05:43:02.430 --> 05:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
saying don't you can't rely on it we're
 
05:43:04.390 --> 05:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
not responsible if there's a mistake all
 
05:43:07.708 --> 05:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
right that that's just
 
05:43:10.430 --> 05:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
semantics representative Lon um thank
 
05:43:12.510 --> 05:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for all
 
05:43:13.990 --> 05:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
the research that you've done and for
 
05:43:16.910 --> 05:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
coming to um share some of your findings
 
05:43:19.628 --> 05:43:19.638 align:start position:0%
um my first question is around the data
 
05:43:22.190 --> 05:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
that you're looking to get from the IIs
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
my question would be um just so that we
 
05:43:27.270 --> 05:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
can have good solid data and be able to
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
show which events have no relationship
 
05:43:33.670 --> 05:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
to a vac vaccination event and to be
 
05:43:35.548 --> 05:43:35.558 align:start position:0%
able to appropriately case match them
 
05:43:37.548 --> 05:43:37.558 align:start position:0%
between those with a vaccination event
 
05:43:39.990 --> 05:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
and those without would you be amenable
 
05:43:42.670 --> 05:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
to having um it indicate whether a
 
05:43:46.110 --> 05:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
person um has no IIs record because they
 
05:43:49.070 --> 05:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
have not enrolled in the IIs or if they
 
05:43:51.390 --> 05:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
have a record with with no vaccination
 
05:43:53.628 --> 05:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
events because those two it could
 
05:43:55.750 --> 05:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
confound the data if you have somebody
 
05:43:58.110 --> 05:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
who has not chosen to participate in the
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
registry versus those with no vaccine
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
offense yeah absolutely if if uh if they
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
chose not to participate the record's
 
05:44:08.030 --> 05:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
not there it's not there you know you
 
05:44:10.948 --> 05:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
you can't blame um so if there needs to
 
05:44:13.350 --> 05:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
be wording I can't remember what the
 
05:44:14.990 --> 05:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
exact wording is I thought I I counted
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
for that because if there's no record
 
05:44:17.788 --> 05:44:17.798 align:start position:0%
you can't blame a guy for not putting it
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
on the death certificate I that's what
 
05:44:22.190 --> 05:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
you're saying right
 
05:44:25.310 --> 05:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and then as my followup um I think
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
that this idea of these audits are
 
05:44:29.150 --> 05:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful but I do know that
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
Academia or Pharma may also be
 
05:44:33.190 --> 05:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
interested in this in order to improve
 
05:44:35.468 --> 05:44:35.478 align:start position:0%
outcomes my question would be that if
 
05:44:37.868 --> 05:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
those four audit roles are not filled
 
05:44:40.110 --> 05:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
with um private individuals or with the
 
05:44:42.990 --> 05:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
public um if opening up those to
 
05:44:46.270 --> 05:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
Academia or to um or to Pharma companies
 
05:44:48.708 --> 05:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
or anybody who's Associated who want to
 
05:44:50.948 --> 05:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
get those data and perhaps improve life
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial yeah I I don't think
 
05:44:55.590 --> 05:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
it needs to be statutorily included um I
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
believe that the Department of Public
 
05:44:58.590 --> 05:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
Health could probably have them just
 
05:45:00.548 --> 05:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
sign a contractor agreement and invite
 
05:45:02.868 --> 05:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
them in to look at the data under NDA I
 
05:45:04.750 --> 05:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know that what this does
 
05:45:06.548 --> 05:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
is it compels that the work be done for
 
05:45:09.390 --> 05:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
the people but if you want to add Pharma
 
05:45:13.150 --> 05:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
that would be up to you know your uh HHS
 
05:45:16.190 --> 05:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
Department thank you thanks other
 
05:45:18.310 --> 05:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nagel thank you
 
05:45:21.310 --> 05:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um or Mr chairman
 
05:45:23.868 --> 05:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
sorry it's late thank you for taking my
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
question I I have actually two questions
 
05:45:28.590 --> 05:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
one has to do with the data that you're
 
05:45:30.750 --> 05:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
collect cting that you want reported
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
within such and such a time frame I mean
 
05:45:35.150 --> 05:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things we know in medicine is
 
05:45:37.310 --> 05:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
that Association doesn't necessarily
 
05:45:40.230 --> 05:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
imply cause and what I'm looking at is
 
05:45:42.590 --> 05:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
the data that you want on a on a Rel on
 
05:45:45.030 --> 05:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
a regular basis implies a number of Co
 
05:45:46.868 --> 05:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
morbility a vaccine type things like
 
05:45:49.468 --> 05:45:49.478 align:start position:0%
that I don't see type of cause of death
 
05:45:51.750 --> 05:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
listed in that data that's being asked
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
for is that something that you would
 
05:45:56.590 --> 05:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
want um whoever did the audit of the
 
05:45:58.510 --> 05:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
Public Health Data I didn't you know I
 
05:46:00.110 --> 05:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
would hope that it was the immunization
 
05:46:01.990 --> 05:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
registry all Medicare and Medicaid what
 
05:46:03.628 --> 05:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
are they being treated for so if
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
somebody dies on the same day as
 
05:46:07.070 --> 05:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination and about half of the ones
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
that I found were actually fentanyl
 
05:46:12.910 --> 05:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
overdoses yeah okay not not these but I
 
05:46:14.990 --> 05:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
so would you blame the vaccine for that
 
05:46:16.590 --> 05:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I would because I think it
 
05:46:18.190 --> 05:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
affected their brains to cause him Comm
 
05:46:20.830 --> 05:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
suicide but that's a stretch right so
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
what what you're
 
05:46:23.990 --> 05:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
saying yeah correlation doesn't equal
 
05:46:25.868 --> 05:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
causation it's a catchphrase we all now
 
05:46:28.350 --> 05:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
know um it's been drilled out there in
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
the public uh domain but when you see
 
05:46:33.150 --> 05:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
that everybody and this is how I found
 
05:46:34.830 --> 05:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
this stuff when when Cassidy a
 
05:46:36.350 --> 05:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old girl in Massachusetts
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
died they said she died from covid and I
 
05:46:40.510 --> 05:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
was like no way and and I went and got
 
05:46:43.150 --> 05:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
the half a million death certificates
 
05:46:44.830 --> 05:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
and I found that it does say she died of
 
05:46:46.190 --> 05:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
that but then I found a Bears record for
 
05:46:47.628 --> 05:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
a seven-year-old girl the only girl in
 
05:46:49.868 --> 05:46:49.878 align:start position:0%
that time frame who was vaccinated five
 
05:46:52.548 --> 05:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
days before Cassidy died and she reacted
 
05:46:55.390 --> 05:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
in 5 minutes vomited for 8 to 10 hours
 
05:46:57.310 --> 05:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
they gave her a second vaccine a couple
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
weeks later and then that one is the
 
05:47:02.510 --> 05:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
date of January 13 2022 she had
 
05:47:05.070 --> 05:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
immediately stomach uh stomach pain she
 
05:47:07.230 --> 05:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
had 103 degree fever didn't have a
 
05:47:08.628 --> 05:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
bottle movement for three days and
 
05:47:12.910 --> 05:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
Cassidy baraca was dead on um January 18
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
sorry I I'm not sure if I ask the
 
05:47:17.270 --> 05:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
question well when I'm looking at the
 
05:47:18.788 --> 05:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
data that you want there's nothing
 
05:47:20.990 --> 05:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
listed in there as cause of death I mean
 
05:47:22.468 --> 05:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
you have the age when they the
 
05:47:24.468 --> 05:47:24.478 align:start position:0%
vaccination the the death certificates
 
05:47:25.990 --> 05:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
have cause of death H what's that death
 
05:47:27.468 --> 05:47:27.478 align:start position:0%
certificates have cause of death on I
 
05:47:28.910 --> 05:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
know but this is the data that where
 
05:47:31.390 --> 05:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
you're asking the state to
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
report so in section um new section two
 
05:47:38.350 --> 05:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
public immunization death reports um
 
05:47:40.150 --> 05:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
you're asking for aggregate data to be
 
05:47:41.590 --> 05:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
sent I didn't see anywhere where the
 
05:47:43.150 --> 05:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
actual causes of death were going to be
 
05:47:45.548 --> 05:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
included in that data it seems to me
 
05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
05:47:50.030 --> 05:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
important so the section two that you're
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's multiple twos on here
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
can you reference page number line
 
05:47:55.708 --> 05:47:55.718 align:start position:0%
number 25 on page one and it goes all
 
05:47:59.990 --> 05:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
the way to line 13 on page two or 10 oh
 
05:48:04.030 --> 05:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so um correct I didn't have cause
 
05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
there just how many people died within
 
05:48:08.350 --> 05:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
um one day of vaccination three days one
 
05:48:11.430 --> 05:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
week three weeks 10 weeks 25 weeks and
 
05:48:12.868 --> 05:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
the numbers are what they are just
 
05:48:15.468 --> 05:48:15.478 align:start position:0%
report them to the public just Cur I'm
 
05:48:18.070 --> 05:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I want to get to my other question
 
05:48:20.430 --> 05:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
to my other question
 
05:48:22.708 --> 05:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
follow why does that help you how does
 
05:48:24.750 --> 05:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
it help you because you understand cetch
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
catch's parabis and what it means right
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so all other things being equal if
 
05:48:30.590 --> 05:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
there's all of a sudden a spike and a
 
05:48:34.670 --> 05:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
jump yeah then you have to investigate
 
05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
they the public would say darn it you uh
 
05:48:39.788 --> 05:48:39.798 align:start position:0%
HHS of New Hampshire we want you to
 
05:48:41.310 --> 05:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
investigate and if you investigate and
 
05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
find their all pulmonary embolism deaths
 
05:48:45.390 --> 05:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
well you have a problem you figure out
 
05:48:47.990 --> 05:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
the cause but if it's fenel and some guy
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
fell off a cliff and a school bus got in
 
05:48:51.750 --> 05:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
an accident and all of a sudden a bunch
 
05:48:53.390 --> 05:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
of kids died you'll find out almost
 
05:48:54.750 --> 05:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
immediately and you'll report it to the
 
05:48:57.430 --> 05:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
public but those anomalies that occur as
 
05:49:00.310 --> 05:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
a matter of of con quence of accidents
 
05:49:01.590 --> 05:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
people are going to know about but all
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
of a sudden pulmonary umm deaths you're
 
05:49:05.990 --> 05:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to know this this reports it to
 
05:49:07.750 --> 05:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
the public it won't create fear or panic
 
05:49:09.350 --> 05:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
it'll just create the the public to
 
05:49:12.110 --> 05:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
demand of the department tell us what
 
05:49:14.468 --> 05:49:14.478 align:start position:0%
happened please that's
 
05:49:17.910 --> 05:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
all can I ask a second question second
 
05:49:20.350 --> 05:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
one You' asked about four no they were
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
follow-ups on the first this is totally
 
05:49:24.150 --> 05:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
different is it a quick one yeah I think
 
05:49:28.990 --> 05:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
so I um in terms of the um the uh audit
 
05:49:31.708 --> 05:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
how you select that I'm con I I'm a
 
05:49:34.948 --> 05:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
little concerned about who can apply to
 
05:49:37.788 --> 05:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
be an auditor for example if I wanted to
 
05:49:40.150 --> 05:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
just put in a my name into the lottery
 
05:49:42.430 --> 05:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
with no ability to analyze data am I
 
05:49:44.590 --> 05:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to be one of the people no it it
 
05:49:46.190 --> 05:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
says in there they have to has to have a
 
05:49:48.030 --> 05:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
level of competence so each proposal
 
05:49:50.190 --> 05:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
that is that is submitted so you submit
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
a proposal the proposal has to have
 
05:49:54.190 --> 05:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
certain um metrics like you're going to
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
do like I I don't like uh statistical
 
05:49:58.548 --> 05:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
methods with regard to epidemiology but
 
05:50:01.310 --> 05:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
most of you guys do um I I'm an engineer
 
05:50:03.230 --> 05:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
I like waveforms and and calculus and
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
other stuff one of them but if somebody
 
05:50:07.628 --> 05:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
wants to submit a proposal it has to
 
05:50:09.708 --> 05:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
have a level of competence not anybody
 
05:50:10.910 --> 05:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
can submit one but you're going to
 
05:50:13.510 --> 05:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
choose the ones that get to be chosen
 
05:50:15.030 --> 05:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
the four that get to be chosen from the
 
05:50:19.948 --> 05:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely he other questions
 
05:50:23.948 --> 05:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
representative question thank you Mr
 
05:50:26.708 --> 05:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here uh can
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
you explain why the dates of reporting
 
05:50:33.270 --> 05:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
are contingent upon the dates of uh
 
05:50:35.468 --> 05:50:35.478 align:start position:0%
presidential and midterm elections yeah
 
05:50:37.468 --> 05:50:37.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely um everything is political
 
05:50:39.070 --> 05:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
these days and that is the greatest
 
05:50:40.628 --> 05:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
amount of avoidance you could possibly
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
have from any political uh election and
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
if the information were to get out to
 
05:50:47.310 --> 05:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
one candidate not the other some people
 
05:50:49.948 --> 05:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
would rely upon it better um it would
 
05:50:51.548 --> 05:50:51.558 align:start position:0%
probably not be good it wouldn't be fair
 
05:50:53.708 --> 05:50:53.718 align:start position:0%
so this is the fairest way it could be
 
05:50:55.270 --> 05:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
they would have a year to know about it
 
05:50:59.628 --> 05:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
before any election that's why
 
05:50:59.638 --> 05:51:01.070 align:start position:0%
before any election that's why
other

05:51:01.070 --> 05:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions I'm saying no other questions
 
05:51:10.868 --> 05:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:13.750 --> 05:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
you I really do thank you very much okay
 
05:51:13.760 --> 05:51:14.910 align:start position:0%
you I really do thank you very much okay
thank

05:51:14.910 --> 05:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:51:17.788 --> 05:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak are Ryan
 
05:51:20.708 --> 05:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
tanan and chawi chawa from the
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:27.360 --> 05:51:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
Services

05:51:34.830 --> 05:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:36.788 --> 05:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon again I'm uh Dr
 
05:51:38.670 --> 05:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
Ryan tanion uh bureau chief of the
 
05:51:40.070 --> 05:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Infectious Disease Control I'm
 
05:51:42.590 --> 05:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
joined by chawe chaa who is our bureau
 
05:51:43.948 --> 05:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
chief for the Bureau of public health
 
05:51:46.390 --> 05:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
statistics and informatics and we are
 
05:51:48.750 --> 05:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
here today to uh speak in opposition to
 
05:51:51.350 --> 05:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:51:55.990 --> 05:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
1661 um as you know House Bill 661 if
 
05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
enacted would amend RSA 5 C 64a to
 
05:52:02.350 --> 05:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
require death certificates issued in New
 
05:52:04.510 --> 05:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to include immunization
 
05:52:07.868 --> 05:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
records um but sourced solely from
 
05:52:10.270 --> 05:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
individuals uh who are participating in
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire immunization
 
05:52:14.510 --> 05:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
information system the proposed
 
05:52:16.030 --> 05:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
legislation also has specific
 
05:52:18.070 --> 05:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
immunization data elements reporting
 
05:52:20.230 --> 05:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
requirements and as others have spoken
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
already uh some independent audit
 
05:52:26.270 --> 05:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
reports so first house bill 1661
 
05:52:30.150 --> 05:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
conflicts with RSA 141 c2f Roman numeral
 
05:52:32.788 --> 05:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
5 which outlines the allowable use for
 
05:52:35.910 --> 05:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
nhis information under current law
 
05:52:38.150 --> 05:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
allowable uses include ensuring
 
05:52:39.788 --> 05:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
participants receive recommended
 
05:52:42.150 --> 05:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
immunizations in a timely manner
 
05:52:44.110 --> 05:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
facilitating reminders or notices to
 
05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
participants when due for recommended
 
05:52:48.548 --> 05:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
immunizations and assisting in indent
 
05:52:50.910 --> 05:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
identifying individuals who may require
 
05:52:53.628 --> 05:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
immunizations during disease outbreaks
 
05:52:55.910 --> 05:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
so limitations on the use of participant
 
05:52:58.190 --> 05:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
information were established for the par
 
05:53:00.310 --> 05:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
protection of privacy and expanding this
 
05:53:03.070 --> 05:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
use as outlined in House Bill 1661 it
 
05:53:04.948 --> 05:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
would not be considered
 
05:53:08.548 --> 05:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
allowable House Bill 1661 also conflicts
 
05:53:13.310 --> 05:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
with RSA 141 C20 F Roman numeral uh VI
 
05:53:17.230 --> 05:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
subsection F and administrative rule HP
 
05:53:19.868 --> 05:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
30704 which is related to authorized
 
05:53:21.310 --> 05:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
access to
 
05:53:24.670 --> 05:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
nhis so authorized access is limited to
 
05:53:26.670 --> 05:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
administering current and former
 
05:53:28.590 --> 05:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers the the division of
 
05:53:30.750 --> 05:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services with limited
 
05:53:32.670 --> 05:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
access provided to schools child care
 
05:53:35.190 --> 05:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
agencies and local Health departments
 
05:53:38.070 --> 05:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
under the current statute and Rule not
 
05:53:40.350 --> 05:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
all persons who may medically certify a
 
05:53:42.548 --> 05:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
death record such as the medical
 
05:53:45.030 --> 05:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
examiner are authorized unrestricted
 
05:53:46.190 --> 05:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
access to the
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
nhis so the department believes that
 
05:53:51.350 --> 05:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
broadly granting unrestricted access to
 
05:53:54.110 --> 05:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
nhis to any person who can certify a
 
05:53:56.230 --> 05:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
death certificate could be costly and
 
05:53:59.390 --> 05:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
present privacy and security concern s
 
05:54:01.150 --> 05:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh if enacted we would require
 
05:54:02.750 --> 05:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
additional safeguards to protect
 
05:54:05.150 --> 05:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
participant information from potential
 
05:54:05.160 --> 05:54:06.548 align:start position:0%
participant information from potential
unauthorized

05:54:06.548 --> 05:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
unauthorized
 
05:54:09.670 --> 05:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
access additionally house bill 16006
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
from the 2022 session amended nhis to be
 
05:54:16.948 --> 05:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
an opin in voluntary registry so as a
 
05:54:19.070 --> 05:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
result immunizations immunization
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
records of persons who did not
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
voluntarily choose to participate in the
 
05:54:25.750 --> 05:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
registry could not be included as part
 
05:54:28.030 --> 05:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
of their death certificate so other imun
 
05:54:29.948 --> 05:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
ization records that are not contained
 
05:54:31.390 --> 05:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:54:34.430 --> 05:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
IIs U may be omitted or would be
 
05:54:36.590 --> 05:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
unavailable and those include medical
 
05:54:38.910 --> 05:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
records Med uh records of persons who
 
05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
have opted out or withdrawn their
 
05:54:42.628 --> 05:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
information from the registry or those
 
05:54:44.708 --> 05:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
who have SE received immunizations
 
05:54:47.110 --> 05:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire so because the
 
05:54:49.150 --> 05:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
legislation does not require other
 
05:54:51.270 --> 05:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
sources of immunization records to be
 
05:54:53.590 --> 05:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
included as part of a death certificate
 
05:54:55.750 --> 05:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation is establishing a
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
biased standard for nhis particip an
 
05:55:01.150 --> 05:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
when compared to non-participants of the
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
registry so functionally information in
 
05:55:07.350 --> 05:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
the IIs may be incomplete or potentially
 
05:55:09.510 --> 05:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
incompatible to align with death
 
05:55:11.390 --> 05:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
certificates processed by the division
 
05:55:12.830 --> 05:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
of Vital Records
 
05:55:15.270 --> 05:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
Administration data in the
 
05:55:18.030 --> 05:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
nhis would be considered incomplete for
 
05:55:20.350 --> 05:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
the purpose of vital record standards as
 
05:55:22.868 --> 05:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
it may be self-reported it could and
 
05:55:25.390 --> 05:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
also be changed by the participant so
 
05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
unlike for Vital Records nhis does not
 
05:55:30.590 --> 05:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
require the use of a participant's legal
 
05:55:33.708 --> 05:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
name permanent address or contain other
 
05:55:35.590 --> 05:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
identifiers such as a driver's license
 
05:55:37.868 --> 05:55:37.878 align:start position:0%
or Social Security number so the
 
05:55:39.628 --> 05:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
department is concerned that the
 
05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
information between the two two systems
 
05:55:44.390 --> 05:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
could not correspond to the exact death
 
05:55:46.350 --> 05:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
certificate placing a burden and
 
05:55:49.310 --> 05:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
liability on the person certifying the
 
05:55:49.320 --> 05:55:50.230 align:start position:0%
liability on the person certifying the
death

05:55:50.230 --> 05:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
death
 
05:55:51.990 --> 05:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
certificate and then lastly the
 
05:55:54.190 --> 05:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
department we use a robust contract and
 
05:55:56.948 --> 05:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
procurement process to facilitate audits
 
05:55:59.310 --> 05:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh selecting an auditor through a random
 
05:56:02.670 --> 05:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
Lottery would bypass wellestablished uh
 
05:56:04.910 --> 05:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
competitively bid and thorough vetting
 
05:56:07.310 --> 05:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
process so the department uses a minimum
 
05:56:09.468 --> 05:56:09.478 align:start position:0%
necessary approach when granting access
 
05:56:11.468 --> 05:56:11.478 align:start position:0%
to data sets containing personally
 
05:56:11.478 --> 05:56:12.910 align:start position:0%
to data sets containing personally
identifiable

05:56:12.910 --> 05:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
identifiable
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
information or information technology
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
platforms and we believe that house bill
 
05:56:20.510 --> 05:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
1661 would weaken measures currently in
 
05:56:22.190 --> 05:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
place to protect and maintain the
 
05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
Integrity of these data and patient
 
05:56:27.230 --> 05:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
information and this language does not
 
05:56:29.788 --> 05:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
set forth clear standards certifications
 
05:56:31.830 --> 05:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
or qualifications of the persons or
 
05:56:34.868 --> 05:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
organizations conducting such audits so
 
05:56:37.670 --> 05:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
in summary the department is opposed to
 
05:56:40.468 --> 05:56:40.478 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1661 due to the data
 
05:56:42.788 --> 05:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
limitations potential incompatibilities
 
05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the data sets uh as it relates to
 
05:56:46.788 --> 05:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
death certificates and we believe that
 
05:56:49.230 --> 05:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
there's also a undue burden placed on
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
the uh persons who are medically
 
05:56:53.548 --> 05:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
certifying death certificates and we
 
05:56:55.670 --> 05:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
05:56:58.750 --> 05:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
05:57:00.830 --> 05:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you very
 
05:57:03.030 --> 05:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question I just had a
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
question on your written testimony was
 
05:57:07.070 --> 05:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
that submitted through the system or was
 
05:57:09.868 --> 05:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
it because I haven't seen it and maybe I
 
05:57:11.830 --> 05:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
just missed it because I wasn't here at
 
05:57:13.548 --> 05:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
the very beginning thank you for the
 
05:57:21.430 --> 05:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:25.030 --> 05:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
electronic could you very kindly in the
 
05:57:28.030 --> 05:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
future also submit it in print copy for
 
05:57:30.110 --> 05:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
those of us who keep our
 
05:57:32.948 --> 05:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
records in print it would be really
 
05:57:34.910 --> 05:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
helpful and I didn't catch any of those
 
05:57:37.708 --> 05:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
citations and I'm the I'm the person who
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
likes citations so that would be helpful
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you and there have been
 
05:57:46.270 --> 05:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
issues with the submission system in the
 
05:57:49.310 --> 05:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
past representative Missour thank you Mr
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my questions
 
05:57:55.230 --> 05:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
my question I might have one more um is
 
05:58:00.110 --> 05:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
DHHS as alarmed as a a lot many other
 
05:58:03.830 --> 05:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
people um regarding the amount of sudden
 
05:58:07.310 --> 05:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
deaths turbo cancers Etc that have been
 
05:58:09.910 --> 05:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
happening ever since the covid vaccine
 
05:58:12.430 --> 05:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
has been released is is that on your
 
05:58:14.788 --> 05:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
radar are you alarmed At All by it is it
 
05:58:17.430 --> 05:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
anything you're going to be looking into
 
05:58:20.190 --> 05:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
or think you should be thank you for the
 
05:58:22.750 --> 05:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
question so DHHS where we are
 
05:58:24.350 --> 05:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
specifically in the division of Public
 
05:58:28.788 --> 05:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
Health Services we um when we look at
 
05:58:31.070 --> 05:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
death data it is based on what is
 
05:58:34.030 --> 05:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
reported through the vital record system
 
05:58:35.868 --> 05:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
and the death certificates uh we
 
05:58:37.990 --> 05:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily look at anything
 
05:58:40.750 --> 05:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
beyond that unless there was a concern
 
05:58:44.110 --> 05:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
and as far as uh deaths reported related
 
05:58:46.670 --> 05:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
to vaccines that is uh reported through
 
05:58:48.830 --> 05:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
the v's vaccine adverse event reporting
 
05:58:51.030 --> 05:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
system which can can be done by medical
 
05:58:52.510 --> 05:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
professionals but it can also be done by
 
05:58:55.350 --> 05:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
anyone and it's also um
 
05:59:00.030 --> 05:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
self-reported yeah follow up y so um the
 
05:59:02.390 --> 05:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
amount of sudden deaths and also the
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
ages of the people as to where this is
 
05:59:08.110 --> 05:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
happening that you're saying that this
 
05:59:12.750 --> 05:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
isn't hasn't just spiked an alarm that
 
05:59:14.310 --> 05:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
hey maybe this is something we should
 
05:59:16.350 --> 05:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
look at because this person is 27 year
 
05:59:18.910 --> 05:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
old 27 years old this person's a
 
05:59:21.830 --> 05:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
teenager myocard artist all of that like
 
05:59:24.990 --> 05:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
this is all just I mean anyone right now
 
05:59:27.390 --> 05:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
can look around and see what's happening
 
05:59:27.400 --> 05:59:28.150 align:start position:0%
can look around and see what's happening
so

05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:59:32.750 --> 05:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
so it the fact that is DHS are are you
 
05:59:32.760 --> 05:59:34.750 align:start position:0%
so it the fact that is DHS are are you
at

05:59:34.750 --> 05:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:59:37.868 --> 05:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
all forming any kind of committee or
 
05:59:40.830 --> 05:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
anything to look into this in to what's
 
05:59:44.190 --> 05:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
happening is that on your radar did you
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
yeah I um for the record my name is joa
 
05:59:50.948 --> 05:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
Chola C A Hui CH a WLA I'm the bureau
 
05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
chief of Public Health statistic
 
05:59:55.468 --> 05:59:55.478 align:start position:0%
informatic so on the division of Public
 
05:59:57.910 --> 05:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
Health Services we do publish uh
 
06:00:01.270 --> 06:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
aggregate that data on our data system
 
06:00:03.350 --> 06:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh right now the most current one I
 
06:00:05.230 --> 06:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
believe is
 
06:00:08.590 --> 06:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
202022 we are waiting for the final um
 
06:00:10.548 --> 06:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
confirmation from the most recent year
 
06:00:13.270 --> 06:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
data from those data portal as well as
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
the statistic reported that we um
 
06:00:19.270 --> 06:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
release based on the program needs we do
 
06:00:22.070 --> 06:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
focus on certain indicators uh just
 
06:00:25.830 --> 06:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
before this um this hearing uh I have my
 
06:00:28.590 --> 06:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
staff to look into the most current
 
06:00:31.270 --> 06:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
death certificate data to see if there's
 
06:00:36.030 --> 06:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
any uh vaccine uh causing adverse effect
 
06:00:39.830 --> 06:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
um this type of Records using icd1 Code
 
06:00:43.468 --> 06:00:43.478 align:start position:0%
uh so wh does have um icd10 code for
 
06:00:47.230 --> 06:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine which is U1 12.9 I we
 
06:00:49.788 --> 06:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
look at that data uh uh this coding
 
06:00:51.990 --> 06:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me the ICD codes against the
 
06:00:55.910 --> 06:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
deide record data we found no record
 
06:00:58.390 --> 06:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
that um has the
 
06:01:01.230 --> 06:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
we found no record that um you know
 
06:01:03.948 --> 06:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
related to those icd10 codes that we
 
06:01:07.350 --> 06:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
looking into that related to the vaccine
 
06:01:11.430 --> 06:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
um adverse uh effect so we do look into
 
06:01:15.070 --> 06:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh different kind of topic um for the uh
 
06:01:15.080 --> 06:01:16.390 align:start position:0%
uh different kind of topic um for the uh
reporting

06:01:16.390 --> 06:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
purpose and I'm sorry just I just want
 
06:01:22.910 --> 06:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
to um emphasize that uh this bill will
 
06:01:25.670 --> 06:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
amended the RSA 5c
 
06:01:29.150 --> 06:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
64a this is under uh division of Vital
 
06:01:31.150 --> 06:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
Records Administration which is under
 
06:01:33.390 --> 06:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of state so New Hampshire is
 
06:01:35.270 --> 06:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
the only state that the vital records
 
06:01:38.190 --> 06:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
statistic reporting system over B record
 
06:01:41.910 --> 06:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
statistic data system not under Health
 
06:01:44.948 --> 06:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
Department in the nation so to amend
 
06:01:47.310 --> 06:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
this part we will need to uh work with
 
06:01:49.150 --> 06:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
the division of vital record
 
06:01:52.110 --> 06:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
Administration uh if the if the B is in
 
06:01:55.430 --> 06:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
act and I believe that the division of B
 
06:01:58.548 --> 06:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
record Administration also me a written
 
06:02:01.510 --> 06:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
testimony uh as far as we were
 
06:02:04.830 --> 06:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
told y representative Leon and then
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I think you have
 
06:02:06.120 --> 06:02:07.590 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I think you have
your

06:02:07.590 --> 06:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:02:10.390 --> 06:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
hand okay representative Leon sorry can
 
06:02:12.070 --> 06:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
I ask one follow-up question to
 
06:02:13.590 --> 06:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative Missour and then ask my
 
06:02:15.628 --> 06:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
questions the first question would was
 
06:02:17.628 --> 06:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
about the icd10 codes for the co
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination are those only for people
 
06:02:21.910 --> 06:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
who have been vaccinated in a do
 
06:02:23.468 --> 06:02:23.478 align:start position:0%
doctor's office or would that also
 
06:02:25.788 --> 06:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
capture those who are going to a drug
 
06:02:28.150 --> 06:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
store or some other location that's not
 
06:02:29.948 --> 06:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
a doctor's office for that
 
06:02:32.868 --> 06:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
Administration the icd1 codes that I
 
06:02:35.750 --> 06:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
just mentioned is uh based on the bu
 
06:02:39.548 --> 06:02:39.558 align:start position:0%
certificate uh on the um cause of death
 
06:02:41.910 --> 06:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
description and also the ICD code that
 
06:02:44.070 --> 06:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
transferred uh from the birth
 
06:02:47.590 --> 06:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
certificate uh this ICD code so uh this
 
06:02:50.468 --> 06:02:50.478 align:start position:0%
will be certified uh by the either
 
06:02:52.590 --> 06:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
medical examiner or their CER uh
 
06:02:56.270 --> 06:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
certifiers to fill out this form so uh
 
06:02:58.110 --> 06:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
this part of information
 
06:03:00.350 --> 06:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm not in the best position to
 
06:03:02.628 --> 06:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
answer how this is a certified how that
 
06:03:05.390 --> 06:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
certificate is a certified but the icd1
 
06:03:07.868 --> 06:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
code is based on our uh search through
 
06:03:11.468 --> 06:03:11.478 align:start position:0%
all the icd10 mortality codes uh that
 
06:03:14.590 --> 06:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
related or has vaccine as a keyword we
 
06:03:19.390 --> 06:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
use that uh as our um very roughly um
 
06:03:22.708 --> 06:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
just have a fresh look and to search
 
06:03:25.548 --> 06:03:25.558 align:start position:0%
those codes in the v death certificate
 
06:03:29.990 --> 06:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh database and we found um no record um
 
06:03:32.990 --> 06:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
redated to vaccine adver effort based on
 
06:03:35.310 --> 06:03:35.320 align:start position:0%
our current database that we have access
 
06:03:37.548 --> 06:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
to okay is that another followup
 
06:03:40.628 --> 06:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
followup um my my next my my actual
 
06:03:42.270 --> 06:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
question that I was initially trying to
 
06:03:44.990 --> 06:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
ask um I know that we've seen the v's
 
06:03:46.990 --> 06:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
data and there's been a lot of
 
06:03:48.868 --> 06:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
skepticism about the applicability of
 
06:03:51.590 --> 06:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
the vers data um I'd like to know how
 
06:03:54.548 --> 06:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
you view self-reported information such
 
06:03:56.868 --> 06:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
as the vs database as opposed to more
 
06:03:59.788 --> 06:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
pop populationbased um recordkeeping how
 
06:04:01.868 --> 06:04:01.878 align:start position:0%
in Sweden we're able to look with they
 
06:04:03.670 --> 06:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot of information on their
 
06:04:05.070 --> 06:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
population and their health and there's
 
06:04:08.510 --> 06:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of population-based data would
 
06:04:10.910 --> 06:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
having this information including a
 
06:04:13.510 --> 06:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
recognition for those patients who have
 
06:04:15.948 --> 06:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
no IIs record and therefore it's not a
 
06:04:19.030 --> 06:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
zero entrance it's a null entry give us
 
06:04:20.590 --> 06:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
something that is more meaningful than
 
06:04:22.628 --> 06:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
Bears even if we aren't able to reach
 
06:04:25.390 --> 06:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
the Swedish registry model to look at
 
06:04:28.350 --> 06:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
look at case matched p people and see if
 
06:04:30.150 --> 06:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
there is a signal of risk here in New
 
06:04:32.350 --> 06:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or a signal of no risk quite
 
06:04:35.110 --> 06:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
frankly practically this could be done
 
06:04:37.270 --> 06:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
however we w we are worried about the
 
06:04:39.548 --> 06:04:39.558 align:start position:0%
data limitation and data quality
 
06:04:42.750 --> 06:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
particularly in our uh New Hampshire in
 
06:04:45.190 --> 06:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
immunization information system excuse
 
06:04:50.430 --> 06:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
me um like Dr tenan addressed that NH is
 
06:04:53.110 --> 06:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
um uping and self report voluntary
 
06:04:57.190 --> 06:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
system so uh some identifiers such as
 
06:05:00.868 --> 06:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
names uh and address we we don't
 
06:05:04.310 --> 06:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
validate that um so in order to link
 
06:05:07.270 --> 06:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
back to our um in order to link back to
 
06:05:09.628 --> 06:05:09.638 align:start position:0%
the V record that certificate data it
 
06:05:11.548 --> 06:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
probably won't have the one-on-one match
 
06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
it would be very fuzzy match in that
 
06:05:15.430 --> 06:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
sense to
 
06:05:18.190 --> 06:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
identify how many you know to to make
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
some connection between those two system
 
06:05:21.788 --> 06:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
would be a little bit risky and the
 
06:05:24.350 --> 06:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
result may not be really meaningful in a
 
06:05:28.548 --> 06:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
a statistic standpoint but so we uh are
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
happy to look into and maybe do some Pro
 
06:05:33.788 --> 06:05:33.798 align:start position:0%
of concept however this will have a
 
06:05:36.070 --> 06:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:05:39.468 --> 06:05:39.478 align:start position:0%
um all right one more followup follow up
 
06:05:41.868 --> 06:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
um so I recognize that there are some
 
06:05:43.750 --> 06:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
that are not going to be able to me
 
06:05:47.110 --> 06:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
match to the registry if out of a 100
 
06:05:51.030 --> 06:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
deaths um 10 let's say only 25% of them
 
06:05:53.390 --> 06:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
had have valid entries with which to
 
06:05:56.310 --> 06:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
compare with the IIs in which you either
 
06:05:58.030 --> 06:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
have records of vaccination or no
 
06:06:00.948 --> 06:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
records of vaccination is there value to
 
06:06:03.190 --> 06:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
be able to case match those individuals
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
to look and see if there is either a
 
06:06:07.270 --> 06:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
signal of risk to the people of New
 
06:06:09.868 --> 06:06:09.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or to say that we have case
 
06:06:11.750 --> 06:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
matched and we are not seeing any
 
06:06:14.590 --> 06:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
indication of higher mortality after
 
06:06:16.230 --> 06:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
these vaccinations and to start
 
06:06:17.830 --> 06:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
rebuilding that trust that's so
 
06:06:17.840 --> 06:06:19.510 align:start position:0%
rebuilding that trust that's so
desperately

06:06:19.510 --> 06:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
desperately
 
06:06:25.230 --> 06:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
needed again um based on the data system
 
06:06:27.430 --> 06:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
quality and limitation we don't
 
06:06:31.510 --> 06:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
recommend to do so uh until we have
 
06:06:34.430 --> 06:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
really comprehensive is system
 
06:06:36.990 --> 06:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
established and the uh data points are
 
06:06:39.868 --> 06:06:39.878 align:start position:0%
all validated then we can perform that
 
06:06:42.708 --> 06:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
right now we can look into the V records
 
06:06:45.468 --> 06:06:45.478 align:start position:0%
uh that certificated data set and using
 
06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
the um cause of that description and
 
06:06:50.750 --> 06:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
also ICD code to identify how many
 
06:06:53.468 --> 06:06:53.478 align:start position:0%
people are you know certified with this
 
06:06:56.190 --> 06:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
typ were certified on under this type of
 
06:06:59.350 --> 06:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
cause of debt and produce that result
 
06:07:02.670 --> 06:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
and in fact um division ofal record they
 
06:07:08.110 --> 06:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
do have neverin and HB r n uh statistic
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
um Reporting System query system
 
06:07:12.948 --> 06:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
available for all the public you know um
 
06:07:15.830 --> 06:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
users to be able to query uh for the
 
06:07:19.350 --> 06:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
underlying cause of death um that part
 
06:07:22.910 --> 06:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
does not really connect it to any is uh
 
06:07:25.948 --> 06:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
system or vaccine data but to understand
 
06:07:28.390 --> 06:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
the overall cause of death that would be
 
06:07:31.430 --> 06:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
the entry point for us to use as well I
 
06:07:34.030 --> 06:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
don't think I uh I don't think I answer
 
06:07:36.350 --> 06:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
all your question and sorry if I missed
 
06:07:38.548 --> 06:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh part of the question however maybe
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
you can describe on the I limitation
 
06:07:44.190 --> 06:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
again yeah if I may you know sharing an
 
06:07:45.670 --> 06:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
example of you know some of the
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
limitations as you know we spoken to
 
06:07:50.670 --> 06:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
earlier uh for example with the IIs
 
06:07:54.150 --> 06:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
system um there's no requirement to have
 
06:07:56.868 --> 06:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
say a legal name so someone named
 
06:07:58.830 --> 06:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
William could be in there as Bill or
 
06:08:01.628 --> 06:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
Susan is in there as Sue so it it places
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
a tremendous burden on the certifier of
 
06:08:07.270 --> 06:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
the death certificate to have to go
 
06:08:10.070 --> 06:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
through all the you know you know
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
hundreds or thousands of Records in IIs
 
06:08:14.190 --> 06:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the person they're
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
associating an immunization record to
 
06:08:18.430 --> 06:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
matches someone's Legal Information
 
06:08:19.510 --> 06:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's contained in the death
 
06:08:21.468 --> 06:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
certificate I respectfully I think
 
06:08:23.230 --> 06:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
you're overthinking that part but I know
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's your job so thank you
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
06:08:30.190 --> 06:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
06:08:33.310 --> 06:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
so I might have this all wrong but um
 
06:08:35.310 --> 06:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
when the medical examiner is determining
 
06:08:37.510 --> 06:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
the cause of death and writing a report
 
06:08:37.520 --> 06:08:39.070 align:start position:0%
the cause of death and writing a report
do

06:08:39.070 --> 06:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:08:42.150 --> 06:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
they do they take into consideration
 
06:08:44.750 --> 06:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
available medical records or interviews
 
06:08:46.708 --> 06:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
with families that
 
06:08:49.190 --> 06:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
might shed some light on whether there's
 
06:08:52.390 --> 06:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
a correlation with a recent
 
06:08:54.628 --> 06:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
vaccination I thank you for the question
 
06:08:55.830 --> 06:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe we're in a position
 
06:08:57.788 --> 06:08:57.798 align:start position:0%
to speak for the Office of the uh chief
 
06:09:01.590 --> 06:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
medical examiner and their processes
 
06:09:04.230 --> 06:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions
 
06:09:06.510 --> 06:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative kushman thank you Mr
 
06:09:08.430 --> 06:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
question um so even if we can't
 
06:09:15.190 --> 06:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
crossmatch every death certificate to
 
06:09:20.788 --> 06:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
every record in the vs uh I'm sorry IIs
 
06:09:23.070 --> 06:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
um we would still be able to if there
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
were a significant climb in a certain
 
06:09:29.468 --> 06:09:29.478 align:start position:0%
say it was a cyto storm was a cause of
 
06:09:32.110 --> 06:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
death that all of a sudden had increased
 
06:09:35.468 --> 06:09:35.478 align:start position:0%
fourfold um in this system and then
 
06:09:37.590 --> 06:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
those there might be people who aren't
 
06:09:42.590 --> 06:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
in the system or who um or who you
 
06:09:46.590 --> 06:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't cross reference with but you'd
 
06:09:48.310 --> 06:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
still have the signal there with the
 
06:09:52.230 --> 06:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
data that you had
 
06:09:55.430 --> 06:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
correct theoretically yes however
 
06:09:58.310 --> 06:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
practically in you know is has some
 
06:10:02.350 --> 06:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
specific use and um access restricted by
 
06:10:05.110 --> 06:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
the law so for myself I don't have
 
06:10:08.310 --> 06:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
access to I I have access to vital
 
06:10:10.670 --> 06:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
record because I'm the data Steward but
 
06:10:13.830 --> 06:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have access to uh I so in order
 
06:10:16.708 --> 06:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
for us to do so like what Dr tenan
 
06:10:19.270 --> 06:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
address we will need to look into the
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
statue on how who can access to um both
 
06:10:26.270 --> 06:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
B records and I in order to do uh
 
06:10:28.590 --> 06:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
performance that kind of work but back
 
06:10:32.110 --> 06:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
to the data analysis and statistical um
 
06:10:35.390 --> 06:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
one of the missions that the division um
 
06:10:37.628 --> 06:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services has is really
 
06:10:40.910 --> 06:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
to provide meaningful uh data uh to the
 
06:10:43.310 --> 06:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
public we try to be uh transparent as
 
06:10:45.468 --> 06:10:45.478 align:start position:0%
much as possible without violating any
 
06:10:48.390 --> 06:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
privacy and protecting the
 
06:10:50.948 --> 06:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
confidentiality uh that is our mission
 
06:10:52.708 --> 06:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
and goal to provide this kind of
 
06:10:56.670 --> 06:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
meaningful data so um you know if the
 
06:10:59.788 --> 06:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
data set is not really comparable
 
06:11:02.948 --> 06:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
comparable or is not really has has lots
 
06:11:07.910 --> 06:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
of limitation we really don't um want to
 
06:11:10.030 --> 06:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh perform that kind of analysis and
 
06:11:14.270 --> 06:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
deliver the report that may not be
 
06:11:18.468 --> 06:11:18.478 align:start position:0%
validate follow up so it sounds like the
 
06:11:20.788 --> 06:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
department admits that there are faults
 
06:11:24.350 --> 06:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
with the uh V system and that it's not
 
06:11:26.948 --> 06:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
adequate to perhaps make make
 
06:11:30.910 --> 06:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
determinations on these things um and so
 
06:11:32.750 --> 06:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we could have an
 
06:11:35.590 --> 06:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to bolster our ability to
 
06:11:37.190 --> 06:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
surveil these things in New Hampshire
 
06:11:38.548 --> 06:11:38.558 align:start position:0%
would the department be willing to help
 
06:11:44.270 --> 06:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:46.350 --> 06:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
permissions yeah so thank you for the
 
06:11:46.360 --> 06:11:48.030 align:start position:0%
permissions yeah so thank you for the
question

06:11:48.030 --> 06:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:11:51.070 --> 06:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
um we would say that there's limitations
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the V system um you know just as
 
06:11:55.628 --> 06:11:55.638 align:start position:0%
there are limitations here we would be
 
06:12:00.150 --> 06:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:02.430 --> 06:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
amendments represent
 
06:12:04.310 --> 06:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:12:06.150 --> 06:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and sorry I came
 
06:12:08.230 --> 06:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
in late I was testifying on another bill
 
06:12:11.390 --> 06:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
but just does the does the medical
 
06:12:14.030 --> 06:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
examiner who is writing up the death
 
06:12:17.430 --> 06:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
certificate I know that the IIs is an
 
06:12:20.390 --> 06:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
opt-in but do they have access to look
 
06:12:21.910 --> 06:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
at the
 
06:12:23.990 --> 06:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the question so
 
06:12:26.110 --> 06:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
currently the medical examiner does not
 
06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
have access to the IIs so at a minimum
 
06:12:30.948 --> 06:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chair quick followup follow
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
so at a minimum we would need to grant
 
06:12:36.310 --> 06:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
them access in order to go
 
06:12:38.750 --> 06:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere as we interpret the bill it
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
looks like we would have to Grant anyone
 
06:12:43.110 --> 06:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
who can medically certify a death
 
06:12:46.390 --> 06:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
certificate access to the I thank you
 
06:12:49.110 --> 06:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative palazov thank you Mr
 
06:12:50.990 --> 06:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
question for me it looks like age 22 so
 
06:12:58.788 --> 06:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh we have uh people who write this
 
06:13:02.270 --> 06:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
certificates they wonder why this
 
06:13:05.548 --> 06:13:05.558 align:start position:0%
occurred and then you you use their code
 
06:13:08.430 --> 06:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
to look if something happened for
 
06:13:11.270 --> 06:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
example last year Dr Benjamin Chan
 
06:13:14.948 --> 06:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
testified through DHHS that covid-19
 
06:13:17.990 --> 06:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines indeed cause increase my
 
06:13:20.350 --> 06:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
carditis in certain
 
06:13:23.548 --> 06:13:23.558 align:start position:0%
G uh in certain
 
06:13:27.190 --> 06:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
populations uh so so but
 
06:13:30.070 --> 06:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
before that like for a
 
06:13:34.030 --> 06:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
while uh uh it was pushed on public it
 
06:13:38.628 --> 06:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
pushed on medical examiners that uh my
 
06:13:41.708 --> 06:13:41.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine related my carditis is medical
 
06:13:44.350 --> 06:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
misinformation people were losing their
 
06:13:47.070 --> 06:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
licenses for even mentioning it so of
 
06:13:49.110 --> 06:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
course they were not putting those
 
06:13:53.190 --> 06:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
quotes uh ICD 10 codes uh because they
 
06:13:55.430 --> 06:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want to say that it cost for
 
06:13:58.350 --> 06:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
vacine I didn't they didn't know better
 
06:14:01.510 --> 06:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
what what stopped the heart of a young
 
06:14:04.708 --> 06:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
boy so so you wouldn't look in that Des
 
06:14:07.070 --> 06:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
because it's not on the code and the
 
06:14:09.390 --> 06:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
code wouldn't be there because they were
 
06:14:12.990 --> 06:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
said it's not happening so my
 
06:14:14.230 --> 06:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is that we need something
 
06:14:18.948 --> 06:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
like this bill uh like to try to came
 
06:14:21.788 --> 06:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
out from this Catch 22 situation could
 
06:14:21.798 --> 06:14:24.910 align:start position:0%
out from this Catch 22 situation could
you

06:14:24.910 --> 06:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:27.190 --> 06:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
comment I'm I'm sorry could could you
 
06:14:29.510 --> 06:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
actually State what the question
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
was uh so besides this uh enacting this
 
06:14:39.830 --> 06:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
Bill how are we fix this situation when
 
06:14:41.468 --> 06:14:41.478 align:start position:0%
you only
 
06:14:45.430 --> 06:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
look in uh vaccine
 
06:14:49.670 --> 06:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
related this if it's already listed as
 
06:14:52.350 --> 06:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine related death and don't
 
06:14:54.868 --> 06:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
investigate for example if boys are
 
06:14:57.868 --> 06:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
dying from my carditis in 2021 nobody
 
06:15:00.270 --> 06:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
would put it as vaccine related death so
 
06:15:02.830 --> 06:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
you would never look into it so how do
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
we fix this
 
06:15:08.708 --> 06:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
situation um thank you for the question
 
06:15:11.310 --> 06:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
but I think it goes back to a comment uh
 
06:15:12.830 --> 06:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
I had spoken to
 
06:15:15.548 --> 06:15:15.558 align:start position:0%
earlier the office of the chief medical
 
06:15:17.510 --> 06:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
examiner and those processes are
 
06:15:19.548 --> 06:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
separate from the department and the
 
06:15:22.110 --> 06:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
department isn't necessarily in a place
 
06:15:25.948 --> 06:15:25.958 align:start position:0%
to validate or verify uh the information
 
06:15:25.958 --> 06:15:27.070 align:start position:0%
to validate or verify uh the information
that

06:15:27.070 --> 06:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:15:30.548 --> 06:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
um persons who are certified or persons
 
06:15:31.910 --> 06:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
who are eligible to certify a death
 
06:15:35.390 --> 06:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:37.990 --> 06:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
there other
 
06:15:40.350 --> 06:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
questions okay I think we're all set
 
06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:51.910 --> 06:15:51.920 align:start position:0%

Community Hospitals and all specialty
 
06:16:17.788 --> 06:16:17.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New Hampshire um the
 
06:16:20.350 --> 06:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
hospital Association is opposed to HB
 
06:16:22.750 --> 06:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
1661 and has several concerns with the
 
06:16:24.788 --> 06:16:24.798 align:start position:0%
bill which would require additional
 
06:16:27.948 --> 06:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
steps for providers to comply with RSA
 
06:16:31.070 --> 06:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
5-c 64 medical certification of the
 
06:16:31.080 --> 06:16:32.910 align:start position:0%
5-c 64 medical certification of the
death

06:16:32.910 --> 06:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
death
 
06:16:35.468 --> 06:16:35.478 align:start position:0%
record this would include emergency room
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
doctors physician assistants advanced
 
06:16:40.110 --> 06:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
practice registered nurses and long-term
 
06:16:42.030 --> 06:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
care providers among others who may
 
06:16:43.948 --> 06:16:43.958 align:start position:0%
certifi death certificate so not just
 
06:16:46.350 --> 06:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
the medical examiner of the
 
06:16:49.510 --> 06:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
State current statute States quote the
 
06:16:51.270 --> 06:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
medical certification on the death
 
06:16:52.868 --> 06:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
record shall be completed by the
 
06:16:55.350 --> 06:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
attending physician APRN or physician
 
06:16:59.390 --> 06:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
assistant or certifying physician APRN
 
06:17:01.990 --> 06:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
or physician assistant and made
 
06:17:03.830 --> 06:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
available to the funeral director next
 
06:17:07.070 --> 06:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
of kin or designated agent as soon as
 
06:17:09.670 --> 06:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
possible but no later than 36 hours
 
06:17:11.350 --> 06:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
after the time of
 
06:17:14.910 --> 06:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
death we're concerned the language in HB
 
06:17:17.708 --> 06:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
1661 would create delays to Medical
 
06:17:19.868 --> 06:17:19.878 align:start position:0%
certification of death records given the
 
06:17:22.030 --> 06:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
requirements in this bill to include
 
06:17:24.070 --> 06:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
additional data elements from the New
 
06:17:27.110 --> 06:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire immunization information
 
06:17:29.788 --> 06:17:29.798 align:start position:0%
system this bill would also require
 
06:17:33.270 --> 06:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
access to and training on the use of the
 
06:17:35.788 --> 06:17:35.798 align:start position:0%
nhis which is not currently afforded to
 
06:17:38.270 --> 06:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
all providers who may certify death
 
06:17:40.430 --> 06:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
certificates additionally providers
 
06:17:43.990 --> 06:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
would be responsible and likely liable
 
06:17:46.708 --> 06:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
for positively identifying a New
 
06:17:50.030 --> 06:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire IIs participant is the same
 
06:17:51.708 --> 06:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
individual they are certifying in a
 
06:17:54.230 --> 06:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
death record this could be particularly
 
06:17:57.390 --> 06:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
challenging as the does not include
 
06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
identifiers that would be needed to
 
06:18:01.628 --> 06:18:01.638 align:start position:0%
confirm the patient's
 
06:18:03.670 --> 06:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
identity thank you for the opportunity
 
06:18:06.868 --> 06:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
to provide feedback on this bill we
 
06:18:09.430 --> 06:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
remain opposed and respectfully request
 
06:18:11.628 --> 06:18:11.638 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none okay thank you
 
06:18:18.878 --> 06:18:22.868 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you

two nine people signed up to indicate
 
06:19:14.670 --> 06:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
support for this bill uh two signed up
 
06:19:16.070 --> 06:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
to oppose this
 
06:19:19.390 --> 06:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
bill that is uh for those who were not
 
06:19:22.230 --> 06:19:22.240 align:start position:0%

else signed up to speak today I'm going
 
06:19:38.468 --> 06:19:38.478 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on HB 1661

FN and open the public hearing on uh hb1
 
06:19:46.070 --> 06:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
1669 FN which we had continued to this
 
06:19:47.750 --> 06:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon it was originally scheduled
 
06:19:51.230 --> 06:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
for 11:15 a.m. and I'll recognize the

for moving this later in the day because
 
06:20:36.468 --> 06:20:36.478 align:start position:0%
in person this one had a lot less
 
06:20:38.628 --> 06:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
interest than the other bills and those
 
06:20:40.390 --> 06:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
of us involved were already here for the
 
06:20:42.468 --> 06:20:42.478 align:start position:0%
day um I do want to say that online
 
06:20:43.708 --> 06:20:43.718 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more interest in
 
06:20:45.350 --> 06:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
the bill than we're seeing here there
 
06:20:48.510 --> 06:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
were 154 in support 44 opposed and one
 
06:20:51.590 --> 06:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
neutral uh so as far as the New
 
06:20:54.030 --> 06:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire U immunization information
 
06:20:56.468 --> 06:20:56.478 align:start position:0%
system it was first AU ized a long time
 
06:20:58.190 --> 06:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
ago but it never really got up and
 
06:21:00.070 --> 06:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
running until Co and when it was
 
06:21:02.590 --> 06:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to record the vaccine
 
06:21:04.350 --> 06:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
administrations that happened during
 
06:21:06.468 --> 06:21:06.478 align:start position:0%
covid at the National Guard site and
 
06:21:07.948 --> 06:21:07.958 align:start position:0%
others that happened outside of the
 
06:21:10.430 --> 06:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
normal course um this has been a program
 
06:21:13.070 --> 06:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed as a very big
 
06:21:15.750 --> 06:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
interoperative um interoperative program
 
06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
so that between states it'll be possible
 
06:21:20.468 --> 06:21:20.478 align:start position:0%
to share information um we are a state
 
06:21:22.150 --> 06:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
that takes our privacy very very
 
06:21:25.750 --> 06:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
seriously and in 2018 we passed um
 
06:21:28.230 --> 06:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment we passed Amendment 2B to our
 
06:21:30.510 --> 06:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
constitution about that right to privacy
 
06:21:31.750 --> 06:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things that we need to
 
06:21:33.270 --> 06:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that all of our laws are
 
06:21:36.110 --> 06:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
sweared up and trude with that privacy
 
06:21:37.868 --> 06:21:37.878 align:start position:0%
and that is in the light that I brought
 
06:21:41.788 --> 06:21:41.798 align:start position:0%
this bill this is simply designed to say
 
06:21:45.548 --> 06:21:45.558 align:start position:0%
that we cannot share our IIs data with
 
06:21:48.070 --> 06:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
any other organization or any other body
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
unless they are equipped to honor our
 
06:21:52.270 --> 06:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
law for our withdrawal to treat our
 
06:21:54.110 --> 06:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
privacy the same way that we treat our
 
06:21:56.548 --> 06:21:56.558 align:start position:0%
people's privacy if they're not able to
 
06:21:58.510 --> 06:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
do so then we shouldn't share that
 
06:22:00.670 --> 06:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
information you know um there's some of
 
06:22:02.548 --> 06:22:02.558 align:start position:0%
us that are more sensitive to vaccine
 
06:22:04.030 --> 06:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
information there's other people who are
 
06:22:06.150 --> 06:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
more sensitive to abortion information
 
06:22:07.548 --> 06:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
but we should be treating all of our
 
06:22:10.510 --> 06:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
medical information with equal care and
 
06:22:13.628 --> 06:22:13.638 align:start position:0%
equal diligence um I had included a
 
06:22:15.910 --> 06:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
section in the bill to say that upon
 
06:22:18.030 --> 06:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
specific notorized requests by a patient
 
06:22:19.670 --> 06:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
or the patient's parent or Guardian if
 
06:22:21.750 --> 06:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
the patient's a minor immunization
 
06:22:22.910 --> 06:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
records may be shared with a
 
06:22:25.708 --> 06:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
non-compliant entity um I believe that's
 
06:22:28.868 --> 06:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
why we have the massive fiscal note um
 
06:22:31.270 --> 06:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
because this is a newer program I I
 
06:22:33.230 --> 06:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
didn't quite recognize that the IIs
 
06:22:34.708 --> 06:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
would not be pushing out one
 
06:22:37.270 --> 06:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
individual's information this is looking
 
06:22:39.468 --> 06:22:39.478 align:start position:0%
at the covid vaccine passport system
 
06:22:42.110 --> 06:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
that was happening um I know people that
 
06:22:43.670 --> 06:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
in order to attend conferences they
 
06:22:45.868 --> 06:22:45.878 align:start position:0%
needed to be able to present their their
 
06:22:47.910 --> 06:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine certification on their CA kind
 
06:22:50.030 --> 06:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
of like the one um that the biotech
 
06:22:53.070 --> 06:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
executive had been working on as well so
 
06:22:54.750 --> 06:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
this this was something where somebody
 
06:22:56.990 --> 06:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
would voluntarily share a vaccination
 
06:22:59.750 --> 06:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
event in order to be um authorized into
 
06:23:01.750 --> 06:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
a system I wanted to make it so that it
 
06:23:04.150 --> 06:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
was easy for people to share their IIs
 
06:23:06.628 --> 06:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
data but I think it's a a costly and
 
06:23:08.628 --> 06:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
unnecessary one because that they can
 
06:23:10.628 --> 06:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
ask their provider to share that
 
06:23:12.670 --> 06:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
immunization so I would actually look
 
06:23:15.830 --> 06:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
for us to limit this to only that first
 
06:23:17.590 --> 06:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
sentence and to strike the second one
 
06:23:19.430 --> 06:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
that says upon specific notorized
 
06:23:21.990 --> 06:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
request because I believe that what is
 
06:23:24.830 --> 06:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
what gives the $3 million price tag
 
06:23:27.430 --> 06:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
because if we wait to share our data
 
06:23:30.548 --> 06:23:30.558 align:start position:0%
with those who can honor our requests to
 
06:23:33.150 --> 06:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
keep our our people's privacy um in
 
06:23:35.070 --> 06:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
violate and to make sure that if we
 
06:23:37.310 --> 06:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
withdraw from our registry any other
 
06:23:38.750 --> 06:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
state will also withdraw that
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
information I think it's quite important
 
06:23:42.670 --> 06:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
um I've been working with the Department
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
on some administrative rules that would
 
06:23:46.430 --> 06:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
include language that is similar to this
 
06:23:47.868 --> 06:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
but I think that it's important not just
 
06:23:49.868 --> 06:23:49.878 align:start position:0%
to have an administrative rules but also
 
06:23:53.150 --> 06:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
have to have it in the statutes because
 
06:23:55.670 --> 06:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that if it's some
 
06:23:57.788 --> 06:23:57.798 align:start position:0%
point they decide to wash information
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
back and forth between different states
 
06:24:02.270 --> 06:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
that those who have chosen to leave the
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
registry here in the state are not
 
06:24:08.628 --> 06:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
involuntarily brought back in when their
 
06:24:11.750 --> 06:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
information is shared with another state
 
06:24:14.190 --> 06:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
and as this becomes a more fluid more
 
06:24:16.628 --> 06:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
interoperative system you know we cross
 
06:24:18.390 --> 06:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
state lines for all sorts of things you
 
06:24:19.948 --> 06:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
know partly for some bills and other
 
06:24:22.910 --> 06:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
committees but also to get health care
 
06:24:24.548 --> 06:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
because we have people that go between
 
06:24:25.910 --> 06:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont and New Hampshire
 
06:24:28.030 --> 06:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts and New Hampshire
 
06:24:29.948 --> 06:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
especially for a lot of the Specialized
 
06:24:33.390 --> 06:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
Care and to Maine so if if you're pulled
 
06:24:35.110 --> 06:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
into that system and then your
 
06:24:36.510 --> 06:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
information comes back and you've
 
06:24:38.590 --> 06:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawn here I just want to make sure
 
06:24:40.590 --> 06:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
that we're protecting people's privacy
 
06:24:42.430 --> 06:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
so I know that the department has had
 
06:24:44.990 --> 06:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
some concerns about the cost and I would
 
06:24:47.150 --> 06:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
be helpful to know from them whether
 
06:24:49.948 --> 06:24:49.958 align:start position:0%
removing that specific um that ability
 
06:24:51.708 --> 06:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
to share with a non-compliant entity
 
06:24:53.910 --> 06:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
would resolve the fiscal note and with
 
06:24:56.670 --> 06:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any questions
 
06:24:59.350 --> 06:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you Mr chair
 
06:25:03.270 --> 06:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you Madame Vice chair um I
 
06:25:04.628 --> 06:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
know you weren't a co-sponsor of these
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
other bills we had just been discussing
 
06:25:09.070 --> 06:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
but on the one hand you know it's like
 
06:25:12.628 --> 06:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the IAS records are
 
06:25:14.510 --> 06:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
quote unquote it's been referred to as
 
06:25:16.110 --> 06:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
the people's records and we have a right
 
06:25:18.948 --> 06:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
to know you know what who was vaccinated
 
06:25:21.628 --> 06:25:21.638 align:start position:0%
for what and to tie that into cause the
 
06:25:24.270 --> 06:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
death and stuff but then here it's like
 
06:25:25.708 --> 06:25:25.718 align:start position:0%
well we need to make sure that stuff is
 
06:25:25.718 --> 06:25:26.990 align:start position:0%
well we need to make sure that stuff is
secret

06:25:26.990 --> 06:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
secret
 
06:25:30.708 --> 06:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
so do you see any conflict between these
 
06:25:33.390 --> 06:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
two ideas where on the one hand the IAS
 
06:25:34.990 --> 06:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
you know information should be kind of
 
06:25:37.468 --> 06:25:37.478 align:start position:0%
kept under lock and key and then another
 
06:25:39.190 --> 06:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
way where it's like well we need this
 
06:25:41.390 --> 06:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
information for public health benefits
 
06:25:43.190 --> 06:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
what what are your thoughts on this um
 
06:25:45.310 --> 06:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
so I was somebody who would have been
 
06:25:47.548 --> 06:25:47.558 align:start position:0%
very very happy to enroll in a control
 
06:25:49.910 --> 06:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
group registry when covid was first
 
06:25:51.390 --> 06:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
hitting because I figured it'd be good
 
06:25:54.430 --> 06:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to give my information um and
 
06:25:56.350 --> 06:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
if we were doing Public Health efforts
 
06:25:58.190 --> 06:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
to see how that compared to the natural
 
06:26:01.990 --> 06:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
course and in others um I believe that
 
06:26:05.990 --> 06:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
the data in the previous bill um sorry
 
06:26:07.310 --> 06:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'll back up for just a second I've
 
06:26:08.910 --> 06:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
dealt with a lot of data I've dealt with
 
06:26:11.030 --> 06:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of information um when I was a
 
06:26:12.670 --> 06:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
medical device analyst sometimes we'd
 
06:26:15.070 --> 06:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
look to the populationbased records in
 
06:26:17.628 --> 06:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
Sweden or in other areas and sometimes
 
06:26:19.390 --> 06:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
in order to get good data from a
 
06:26:22.750 --> 06:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
registry type scenario you're going to
 
06:26:25.628 --> 06:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
have to look at a lot of Records to find
 
06:26:27.230 --> 06:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
records that can actually be case
 
06:26:28.750 --> 06:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
matched and that you can look at to see
 
06:26:31.468 --> 06:26:31.478 align:start position:0%
if you can find good data I don't expect
 
06:26:33.430 --> 06:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
that the prior bill will be able to look
 
06:26:37.070 --> 06:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
at every individual because if if in my
 
06:26:39.628 --> 06:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
mind it's properly drafted you have an
 
06:26:42.110 --> 06:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say these are the records
 
06:26:45.628 --> 06:26:45.638 align:start position:0%
who that are within that are in IIs or
 
06:26:47.708 --> 06:26:47.718 align:start position:0%
they have an IIs but there were no
 
06:26:50.110 --> 06:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
events during this time period or no
 
06:26:53.310 --> 06:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
record found because no record found
 
06:26:55.270 --> 06:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that they're not vaccinated
 
06:26:57.430 --> 06:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say that they are and
 
06:26:59.910 --> 06:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
therefore to try to look at any
 
06:27:03.590 --> 06:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
correlation or possible causality um you
 
06:27:06.468 --> 06:27:06.478 align:start position:0%
would need to remove anybody who has
 
06:27:08.948 --> 06:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
chosen not to participate in the IIs
 
06:27:12.510 --> 06:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
system uh the big argument for the IIs
 
06:27:15.070 --> 06:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
is for public health benefit so should
 
06:27:17.310 --> 06:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
somebody choose to participate in it and
 
06:27:18.590 --> 06:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
choose to be able to have their
 
06:27:20.548 --> 06:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
information in there there is an
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
argument that it makes sense to then
 
06:27:24.868 --> 06:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
correlate that so that they may be able
 
06:27:27.030 --> 06:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
to work as an early warning signal to
 
06:27:29.510 --> 06:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
others um when I was a device analyst I
 
06:27:31.110 --> 06:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
actually got to know a pathologist Dr
 
06:27:34.948 --> 06:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
Renu verman she um had noticed that as
 
06:27:36.868 --> 06:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
she was doing some as she doing
 
06:27:38.750 --> 06:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
pathology on patients who had had a drug
 
06:27:41.628 --> 06:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
alluding stent um she was finding that
 
06:27:44.030 --> 06:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
the drug that the coating the antibotic
 
06:27:46.390 --> 06:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
coating had started flaking off and by
 
06:27:48.390 --> 06:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
having that flake off they were having
 
06:27:50.830 --> 06:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
late stent thrombosis events where it
 
06:27:52.390 --> 06:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
was throwing it to another section of
 
06:27:55.230 --> 06:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
the vasculature and then it was causing
 
06:27:57.270 --> 06:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
other clotting issues both in the heart
 
06:27:59.830 --> 06:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the brain and in the lungs had she
 
06:28:01.830 --> 06:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
not been paying attention to this and
 
06:28:04.030 --> 06:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
looking at that signal this wouldn't
 
06:28:06.110 --> 06:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
have really become an issue this would
 
06:28:08.310 --> 06:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
have been a discussion about are we
 
06:28:10.150 --> 06:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
doing enough anti-coagulation and should
 
06:28:13.070 --> 06:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
we extend anti-coagulation longer
 
06:28:16.190 --> 06:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
because Dr verman spoke about this and
 
06:28:18.910 --> 06:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
had limited data but data that gave an
 
06:28:21.590 --> 06:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
indication work was done those codings
 
06:28:23.948 --> 06:28:23.958 align:start position:0%
were changed and actually some people
 
06:28:25.350 --> 06:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
some people changed their Clin iCal
 
06:28:27.070 --> 06:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
course so you don't need to have the
 
06:28:29.430 --> 06:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
information for everybody but if you're
 
06:28:31.590 --> 06:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
able to find the information from those
 
06:28:34.110 --> 06:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
people who are willing to be a part of
 
06:28:36.190 --> 06:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
this data collection there's a high
 
06:28:38.788 --> 06:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
value to it but because it's not a
 
06:28:40.990 --> 06:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
prospective double blinded randomized
 
06:28:42.510 --> 06:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
control study there's always going to be
 
06:28:45.270 --> 06:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
limitations to the data but if this is
 
06:28:46.990 --> 06:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
something our people are experiencing
 
06:28:50.350 --> 06:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to as skydivers do
 
06:28:51.868 --> 06:28:51.878 align:start position:0%
learn from the blood of others instead
 
06:28:54.548 --> 06:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
of having to do it ourselves uh or does
 
06:28:56.230 --> 06:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
it make sense to say just because
 
06:28:58.070 --> 06:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's some challenges we don't want to
 
06:29:01.110 --> 06:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
find any any signals and any messages
 
06:29:04.030 --> 06:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
that people's people are leaving for us
 
06:29:06.628 --> 06:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
so I know that's nuanced but I think
 
06:29:08.430 --> 06:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
that I think that both of those are
 
06:29:11.670 --> 06:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
valuable okay representative and then
 
06:29:14.628 --> 06:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative farmer just a question I
 
06:29:17.548 --> 06:29:17.558 align:start position:0%
mean I'm still putting in my mind as to
 
06:29:20.190 --> 06:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
what the IIs is used for is it is it
 
06:29:24.030 --> 06:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
used you know uh in in to look back at
 
06:29:26.230 --> 06:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
specific cases for transference of
 
06:29:29.750 --> 06:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
specific data or is it used just
 
06:29:33.750 --> 06:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
anonymously for population studies um or
 
06:29:36.230 --> 06:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
both um I'm just trying to understand
 
06:29:38.830 --> 06:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
the scope of how data is used so we are
 
06:29:40.270 --> 06:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
the last state thank you for the
 
06:29:41.830 --> 06:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
question we're the last state to have an
 
06:29:44.030 --> 06:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
active IIs system this is something
 
06:29:45.750 --> 06:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's been building over the years and
 
06:29:47.430 --> 06:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I don't think that all the
 
06:29:50.110 --> 06:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
use cases and everything that it is
 
06:29:51.868 --> 06:29:51.878 align:start position:0%
going to be used for is known at this
 
06:29:53.788 --> 06:29:53.798 align:start position:0%
point because when you have a data
 
06:29:55.190 --> 06:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
source there are lots of different
 
06:29:57.030 --> 06:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
things that you can do and depending on
 
06:29:59.070 --> 06:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
what limitations you have on the data
 
06:30:01.070 --> 06:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that can be done um at the
 
06:30:02.548 --> 06:30:02.558 align:start position:0%
departmental level because it's
 
06:30:04.548 --> 06:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
something that's done through um an
 
06:30:06.468 --> 06:30:06.478 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency and they have a
 
06:30:08.670 --> 06:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
lot of authority to work within that
 
06:30:10.390 --> 06:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
data which they have which is
 
06:30:12.150 --> 06:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate because they should be able
 
06:30:15.030 --> 06:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
to find signals and look and see if
 
06:30:17.150 --> 06:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
after after a certain product is
 
06:30:18.948 --> 06:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
released to the market if there's a
 
06:30:20.590 --> 06:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
signal and death rates that's worth
 
06:30:22.788 --> 06:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
looking into so we need to give them
 
06:30:25.350 --> 06:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
some latitude and flexibility but it's
 
06:30:26.750 --> 06:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
also important to make sure we have
 
06:30:28.390 --> 06:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
guard rails and I think the fact that we
 
06:30:30.948 --> 06:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
don't understand how the IIs will be
 
06:30:34.350 --> 06:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
used now that 50 states are on board
 
06:30:37.150 --> 06:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
especially how the IIs will be used once
 
06:30:39.948 --> 06:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
all 50 states are freely communicating
 
06:30:41.510 --> 06:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
with each other I think that it's
 
06:30:43.590 --> 06:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
important to wait to put our information
 
06:30:45.510 --> 06:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
into that free exchange with other
 
06:30:48.070 --> 06:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
states until we know that the privacy of
 
06:30:50.510 --> 06:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
our people can be respected and also at
 
06:30:52.110 --> 06:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
this point the information is not being
 
06:30:55.030 --> 06:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
shared with other states so this would
 
06:30:56.670 --> 06:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
not be retracting anything that's
 
06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
already happened it's simply putting a
 
06:31:00.708 --> 06:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
condition on that expansion that unless
 
06:31:02.388 --> 06:31:02.398 align:start position:0%
they can honor our privacy and our
 
06:31:04.430 --> 06:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision for privacy
 
06:31:06.030 --> 06:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to share that
 
06:31:08.750 --> 06:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
information followup just a quick
 
06:31:10.510 --> 06:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
followup because I know a lot of the
 
06:31:12.468 --> 06:31:12.478 align:start position:0%
discussion about the database for
 
06:31:14.910 --> 06:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
example for abortion you know there was
 
06:31:17.510 --> 06:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussion oh you know we're going to
 
06:31:19.628 --> 06:31:19.638 align:start position:0%
anonymize that data things of that
 
06:31:21.270 --> 06:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
nature and is that the ultimate
 
06:31:23.868 --> 06:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
intention with the IIs along that same
 
06:31:25.350 --> 06:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
lines or
 
06:31:28.430 --> 06:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
um or is it no you can still go in and
 
06:31:32.910 --> 06:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
get Erica Leon for example's data uh so
 
06:31:35.070 --> 06:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so some of
 
06:31:36.628 --> 06:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
the federal grants that we accepted
 
06:31:39.830 --> 06:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
during covid um were designed to look at
 
06:31:41.388 --> 06:31:41.398 align:start position:0%
different Health Equity looking at the
 
06:31:44.350 --> 06:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates looking at and looking
 
06:31:46.270 --> 06:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
at it being a Health Equity issue for
 
06:31:48.430 --> 06:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
undervaccinated populations by the
 
06:31:51.510 --> 06:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
census block there are over 600 census
 
06:31:54.110 --> 06:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
blocks in my town of Derry so looking at
 
06:31:56.150 --> 06:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
that at that granular level and looking
 
06:31:58.830 --> 06:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
to see that this neighborhood is
 
06:32:01.430 --> 06:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
undervaccinated could in a different in
 
06:32:03.230 --> 06:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
a different Administration and in a
 
06:32:05.430 --> 06:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
different um makeup of people in the
 
06:32:08.830 --> 06:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
government it could lead to a very
 
06:32:11.628 --> 06:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
intensive very invasive door-to-door
 
06:32:15.310 --> 06:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
offering of vaccination or and and I
 
06:32:17.110 --> 06:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is this doesn't
 
06:32:19.590 --> 06:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
concern everybody but the idea of going
 
06:32:22.110 --> 06:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
by and saying I'd like to see I'd like
 
06:32:23.590 --> 06:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
to see your papers have you been
 
06:32:25.190 --> 06:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
immunized in this house
 
06:32:28.670 --> 06:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
house is a very very dangerous thing
 
06:32:31.788 --> 06:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
that is something that it was enabled
 
06:32:34.750 --> 06:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
and was um I believe was worked towards
 
06:32:37.110 --> 06:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
in some other states however the push
 
06:32:39.548 --> 06:32:39.558 align:start position:0%
back against that very invasive level
 
06:32:41.910 --> 06:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
did happen and so we did not violate
 
06:32:43.910 --> 06:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
people's rights to that extent however
 
06:32:46.070 --> 06:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
the words of that grant grant language
 
06:32:47.670 --> 06:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
that was accepted by the executive
 
06:32:49.628 --> 06:32:49.638 align:start position:0%
Council would have allowed that and it
 
06:32:51.788 --> 06:32:51.798 align:start position:0%
would have in fact encouraged that
 
06:32:53.548 --> 06:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
fortunately serer heads
 
06:32:53.558 --> 06:32:55.750 align:start position:0%
fortunately serer heads
prevailed

06:32:55.750 --> 06:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
prevailed
 
06:33:00.948 --> 06:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:04.868 --> 06:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
um okay representative kushman thank you
 
06:33:08.310 --> 06:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you um Madame Vice
 
06:33:12.030 --> 06:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
chair I are you would you believe that
 
06:33:14.830 --> 06:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
um administrative rules for the registry
 
06:33:17.788 --> 06:33:17.798 align:start position:0%
do allow for deidentified data from the
 
06:33:19.510 --> 06:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
registry to be released by the
 
06:33:22.548 --> 06:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
department for research purposes um I
 
06:33:24.270 --> 06:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware of that but I actually
 
06:33:26.388 --> 06:33:26.398 align:start position:0%
think that that's good I love data but I
 
06:33:28.948 --> 06:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
also like it with a good dose of privacy
 
06:33:31.830 --> 06:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to balance the
 
06:33:33.948 --> 06:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
two other
 
06:33:36.708 --> 06:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
06:33:36.718 --> 06:33:42.110 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
thank

06:33:42.110 --> 06:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:45.110 --> 06:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak are Ryan

06:33:53.468 --> 06:33:53.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:53.478 --> 06:33:57.788 align:start position:0%
 
Services

06:33:57.788 --> 06:33:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:59.350 --> 06:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman uh Ryan
 
06:34:00.750 --> 06:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
tanion I'm actually joined today by
 
06:34:03.948 --> 06:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
anarie Mercury sorry actually the other
 
06:34:06.430 --> 06:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
name is on the card though I didn't made
 
06:34:08.510 --> 06:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
it wrong okay thank you thank you yeah
 
06:34:11.910 --> 06:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm joined by Amar merer who's the um
 
06:34:13.270 --> 06:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
administrator for the New Hampshire
 
06:34:15.830 --> 06:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
immunizations program um so we are here
 
06:34:17.548 --> 06:34:17.558 align:start position:0%
today just to provide informational
 
06:34:19.150 --> 06:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
testimony for anyone on the committee
 
06:34:20.628 --> 06:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
that they may have in relation to this
 
06:34:23.150 --> 06:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
bill um as representative Leon had
 
06:34:24.310 --> 06:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned we've been working closely
 
06:34:26.708 --> 06:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
with with her um you know through the
 
06:34:28.388 --> 06:34:28.398 align:start position:0%
administrative rules process which we
 
06:34:31.230 --> 06:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
had a hearing on back on October 3rd uh
 
06:34:33.910 --> 06:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
we collected that feedback that was uh
 
06:34:35.750 --> 06:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
from that hearing as well as the
 
06:34:38.750 --> 06:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
submitted uh feedback online we've
 
06:34:40.990 --> 06:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the proposed rule again we've
 
06:34:42.628 --> 06:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
gone back through with the bill
 
06:34:45.270 --> 06:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor and we have made some you know
 
06:34:47.670 --> 06:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
adjustments and we're you know just here
 
06:34:50.110 --> 06:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
to say that um you know should you know
 
06:34:51.868 --> 06:34:51.878 align:start position:0%
at this time we do not share our
 
06:34:53.670 --> 06:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
information from the IAS with other
 
06:34:57.708 --> 06:34:57.718 align:start position:0%
states or other ities um if we were to
 
06:34:59.948 --> 06:34:59.958 align:start position:0%
that you know there is a robust process
 
06:35:01.468 --> 06:35:01.478 align:start position:0%
that we would have to enter into a
 
06:35:03.788 --> 06:35:03.798 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding and through
 
06:35:06.030 --> 06:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
that memorandum of understanding process
 
06:35:08.030 --> 06:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
we have looked in our rule as well as
 
06:35:09.628 --> 06:35:09.638 align:start position:0%
through this uh legislation that we
 
06:35:12.110 --> 06:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
would require that privacy provision
 
06:35:13.670 --> 06:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
where individuals would be able to
 
06:35:17.150 --> 06:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
withdraw their information as well um
 
06:35:20.110 --> 06:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
again and uh if the bill sponsor chooses
 
06:35:22.590 --> 06:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
to do an amendment then the department
 
06:35:23.990 --> 06:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be happy to take a look at that
 
06:35:26.708 --> 06:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
and update the fiscal note as well so
 
06:35:30.070 --> 06:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:33.070 --> 06:35:33.080 align:start position:0%

your status in terms of vaccines like I
 
06:35:49.310 --> 06:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
I understood that you don't sell
 
06:35:52.310 --> 06:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines to individuals but is it also
 
06:35:56.150 --> 06:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
correct that your PR uring vaccine on
 
06:36:03.990 --> 06:36:04.000 align:start position:0%

Association sure I'd love to answer that
 
06:36:08.150 --> 06:36:08.160 align:start position:0%

06:36:22.670 --> 06:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for the question so
 
06:36:23.868 --> 06:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
uh there were a couple of questions that
 
06:36:26.310 --> 06:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
came out earlier about the nhas so if
 
06:36:28.350 --> 06:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
you don't mind could I explain a little
 
06:36:29.990 --> 06:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
bit about the
 
06:36:34.430 --> 06:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
nhas okay so thank you um so the NH is a
 
06:36:37.030 --> 06:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
new system we launched it in April of
 
06:36:40.548 --> 06:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
2021 um the primary intention as we were
 
06:36:44.150 --> 06:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
building the nhas was to um assist and
 
06:36:46.628 --> 06:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
support the state in maintaining the
 
06:36:48.830 --> 06:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
accountability of vaccines that are
 
06:36:50.230 --> 06:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
distributed through the New Hampshire
 
06:36:53.590 --> 06:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
immunization program so those vaccines
 
06:36:54.830 --> 06:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
are funded
 
06:36:58.230 --> 06:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
through a combination of public funds
 
06:37:00.110 --> 06:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
through the federal government under the
 
06:37:03.070 --> 06:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children program also
 
06:37:05.190 --> 06:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
another program that's Federal is the
 
06:37:09.868 --> 06:37:09.878 align:start position:0%
317 program and that 317 program is for
 
06:37:12.548 --> 06:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
underinsured and uninsured
 
06:37:15.750 --> 06:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
adults um so for the adult section we
 
06:37:18.350 --> 06:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
can only assist for the cost of vaccine
 
06:37:21.110 --> 06:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
for those underinsured and uninsured
 
06:37:23.468 --> 06:37:23.478 align:start position:0%
adults but for the children because we
 
06:37:25.388 --> 06:37:25.398 align:start position:0%
participate in the federal vaccine for
 
06:37:28.628 --> 06:37:28.638 align:start position:0%
children program and New Hampshire
 
06:37:30.868 --> 06:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
statute allows us to collect funds
 
06:37:33.030 --> 06:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire vaccine
 
06:37:35.548 --> 06:37:35.558 align:start position:0%
Association um that would be assessments
 
06:37:38.150 --> 06:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
from the insurance companies we are able
 
06:37:40.548 --> 06:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to provide vaccine at
 
06:37:42.990 --> 06:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
no cost to all children regardless of
 
06:37:44.788 --> 06:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
their insurance
 
06:37:47.628 --> 06:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
status so the program works to maintain
 
06:37:49.670 --> 06:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
the accountability of these vaccines
 
06:37:51.548 --> 06:37:51.558 align:start position:0%
because as you know vaccines are very
 
06:37:53.628 --> 06:37:53.638 align:start position:0%
expensive very costly we want to do a
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
good job that we're a good Steward of
 
06:37:55.440 --> 06:37:56.110 align:start position:0%
good job that we're a good Steward of
the

06:37:56.110 --> 06:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:38:00.190 --> 06:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
monies the um nhas also served to
 
06:38:03.070 --> 06:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
consolidate immunization records for
 
06:38:05.388 --> 06:38:05.398 align:start position:0%
those individuals who are participating
 
06:38:07.948 --> 06:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
in the system so for individuals who
 
06:38:10.990 --> 06:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
voluntarily choose not to give their
 
06:38:12.628 --> 06:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
information that information is not
 
06:38:15.150 --> 06:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
transmitted to the state so we don't
 
06:38:17.670 --> 06:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
have any listings of people who um have
 
06:38:19.750 --> 06:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
opted out we only really know the
 
06:38:22.230 --> 06:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
information from the people who have
 
06:38:24.230 --> 06:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
gone ahead and given that that con cons
 
06:38:26.190 --> 06:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
send to share their
 
06:38:28.750 --> 06:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
information um additionally it's only
 
06:38:31.430 --> 06:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
the providers who receive the the
 
06:38:33.708 --> 06:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine supplied through the state who
 
06:38:37.150 --> 06:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
are required to participate in the nhas
 
06:38:38.270 --> 06:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
so that means that if there are
 
06:38:40.670 --> 06:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
providers who privately purchase the
 
06:38:42.750 --> 06:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine they don't need to report that
 
06:38:44.590 --> 06:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
to us it's only those who get the the
 
06:38:45.830 --> 06:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine through
 
06:38:48.670 --> 06:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
us um so that's just a little bit of of
 
06:38:51.708 --> 06:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
the background there um so I just wanted
 
06:38:53.270 --> 06:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we answered that
 
06:38:55.628 --> 06:38:55.638 align:start position:0%
question and I am so sorry could you
 
06:38:58.110 --> 06:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
please rephrase your original question
 
06:39:00.230 --> 06:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
so I can make sure I address
 
06:39:03.990 --> 06:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
that yeah yes so so just so you said
 
06:39:07.030 --> 06:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
that you do collect funds and uh could
 
06:39:10.230 --> 06:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
could you expand what uh where those
 
06:39:13.990 --> 06:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
funds go do they fund uh general fund or
 
06:39:17.590 --> 06:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
DS directly or split in some way okay
 
06:39:19.270 --> 06:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much because I think that
 
06:39:21.788 --> 06:39:21.798 align:start position:0%
I did include that the funds for the
 
06:39:23.510 --> 06:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines do come through the federal
 
06:39:25.990 --> 06:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children program and then
 
06:39:29.590 --> 06:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
the uh Federal 317 program as well as
 
06:39:32.070 --> 06:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association to
 
06:39:35.270 --> 06:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
cover those non-vf C eligible children
 
06:39:38.510 --> 06:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
so that all children can be
 
06:39:40.388 --> 06:39:40.398 align:start position:0%
vaccinated other questions so the
 
06:39:42.270 --> 06:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
department does not have General funds
 
06:39:44.270 --> 06:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
for the purchase of the vaccine
 
06:39:46.868 --> 06:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
representative mlan thank you Mr chair
 
06:39:48.548 --> 06:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
06:39:51.350 --> 06:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
just as a point of clarification if I go
 
06:39:54.510 --> 06:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
down then and I got my covid shot my flu
 
06:39:57.150 --> 06:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
shot or whatever at Right Aid or
 
06:40:00.750 --> 06:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
CVS um that's not going into the IIs
 
06:40:04.030 --> 06:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
then that actually would go into right a
 
06:40:07.070 --> 06:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
database or CVS's database and they
 
06:40:09.708 --> 06:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
would retain that separately from the
 
06:40:12.310 --> 06:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
IIs am I correct under normal
 
06:40:14.430 --> 06:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances the vaccine that is not
 
06:40:16.910 --> 06:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
distributed through us would not go into
 
06:40:20.510 --> 06:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
the NH covid vaccine was very different
 
06:40:22.910 --> 06:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
because under executive order
 
06:40:25.830 --> 06:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
76 all covid vaccine from the federal
 
06:40:28.150 --> 06:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
government and the state supplied had to
 
06:40:31.070 --> 06:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
go into our our immunization registry so
 
06:40:33.910 --> 06:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine was the only vaccine that
 
06:40:36.388 --> 06:40:36.398 align:start position:0%
was not distributed fully through us
 
06:40:39.628 --> 06:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
that also was reported to the
 
06:40:42.590 --> 06:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
nhas follow up yes so all other vaccines
 
06:40:45.350 --> 06:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
s so covid it's all in there if you opt
 
06:40:47.350 --> 06:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
it in but everything else is not and
 
06:40:49.670 --> 06:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
going forward Right Aid has their own
 
06:40:51.830 --> 06:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
database kind of thing during emergency
 
06:40:51.840 --> 06:40:52.830 align:start position:0%
database kind of thing during emergency
order

06:40:52.830 --> 06:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
order
 
06:40:56.708 --> 06:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
76 um the ability to opt out was
 
06:41:00.190 --> 06:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
temporarily suspended so therefore
 
06:41:01.948 --> 06:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
individuals were not offered the
 
06:41:03.670 --> 06:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to opt out because of
 
06:41:05.990 --> 06:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
emergency order
 
06:41:08.868 --> 06:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
76 other
 
06:41:14.310 --> 06:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:16.548 --> 06:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
much I have no one else signed up to
 
06:41:21.468 --> 06:41:21.478 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 1669 FN uh the blue sheet
 
06:41:23.868 --> 06:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
in the back indicated that uh 10 people
 
06:41:26.868 --> 06:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
did sign in in favor and two against um
 
06:41:29.708 --> 06:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
do we know what happened online and as
 
06:41:31.628 --> 06:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
of right now we gained one person in
 
06:41:33.388 --> 06:41:33.398 align:start position:0%
support since the introduction of the
 
06:41:36.708 --> 06:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
bill with 155 supporting and 44 opposing
 
06:41:38.548 --> 06:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
and one
 
06:41:41.590 --> 06:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
neutral okay uh those are all the bills
 
06:41:43.430 --> 06:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
we had noticed for today again I have no
