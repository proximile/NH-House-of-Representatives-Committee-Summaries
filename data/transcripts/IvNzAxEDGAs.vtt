into interim study
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
we um
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
this is not a public hearing so that
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
people do not sign pink cards and
 
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.430 align:start position:0%
people do not sign pink cards and
testify

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
it is somewhat like an executive session
 
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.510 align:start position:0%
it is somewhat like an executive session
except

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
except
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
we do not craft amendments what we do is
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
we look at the bills before us and we'll
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
make recommendations either that we
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
think it's worthy of representative
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
sorry either recommended for further
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommended for
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
further legislation and
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
i am just remembering that i don't think
 
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.870 align:start position:0%
i am just remembering that i don't think
and

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
maybe our researcher can help me with
 
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.430 align:start position:0%
maybe our researcher can help me with
this

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think we write minority reports
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
on this but i'm not sure do we we don't
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay so we could simply write a report
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
that says the committee was divided as
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
to whether further net legislation was
 
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.670 align:start position:0%
to whether further net legislation was
needed

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm taking it also as here are
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
salient points that the committee
 
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
brought up yeah um
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
i have suggested to
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and bill sponsors and
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors that they either come or
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
send a representative because this bill
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
was not passed it's
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
and it was too good to kill but not good
 
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.070 align:start position:0%
and it was too good to kill but not good
enough

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
to uh otp it's in twilight zone and we
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
will make suggestions that we think will
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
improve the build to give it a better
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
chance when it's refiled and you don't
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
have to take our advice
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
but then again we don't have to pass
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
your bill
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
so it's wise that you find out some of
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
the things that we say
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
so we all look like fools together or
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
you rewrite the bill according to some
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
suggestions we're making now i am going
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
to try to jot down some of those things
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
the blurb
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
before we look at our first bill i have
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
several copies of the executive summary
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
of the division for behavioral health
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
for the 10-year mental health plan and
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
in case i only have
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
eight but i'll pass them around if you
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
don't have one feel free to take one
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
if you don't have one and we've run out
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
feel free to
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
get one from dhhs
 
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.949 align:start position:0%
get one from dhhs
also

00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:27.829 align:start position:0%
also
the

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:28.870 align:start position:0%
the
issue

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
long range plan for
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
the developmentally disabled community
 
00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.430 align:start position:0%
the developmentally disabled community
is

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
by law
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
to come to this committee it did not go
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
to oversight
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
and there are questions by the
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
developmental services quality council
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
as to whether the plan thank you
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
as uh published
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
um is wise or not
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
and so in wonderful hhs and ea committee
 
00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:04.150 align:start position:0%
and so in wonderful hhs and ea committee
style

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
style
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
i thought it might be a good idea to
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
bring together a few representatives
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
from the department and a few
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
representatives from the
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
developmental services quality council
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
our trying to square the circle which is
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
what we're good at
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
and see if we can find some common
 
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.110 align:start position:0%
and see if we can find some common
ground

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
ground
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
between the two groups to come up with a
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
plan that's better than what either side
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
had thought possible
 
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.670 align:start position:0%
had thought possible
this

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
will require the formation of an ad hoc
 
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
will require the formation of an ad hoc
committee

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
i discussed all of this with the speaker
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
at a party on
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
saturday and he said go for it
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
this ad hoc committee must meet in
 
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.269 align:start position:0%
this ad hoc committee must meet in
public

00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%

where the concerns that are allowed and
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
growing can be heard and addressed in
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
ways that are also doable for the
 
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
ways that are also doable for the
department

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
i've asked our committee researcher
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
to come up with a side by side
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
so she is finding the plan from dhhs she
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
is reading the objections from the
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
quality council and on each sub
 
00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:01.829 align:start position:0%
quality council and on each sub
item

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
she will be doing side by side so we can
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
see what one group is doing what one
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
group wants and so on
 
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.470 align:start position:0%
group wants and so on
and

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%

yeah thank you i was about to write
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative acton anyway thank you
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
all right may i remind you that we
 
00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
debated that once about six years ago
 
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.870 align:start position:0%
debated that once about six years ago
[Laughter]

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.750 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
which

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
conversions you and me we did didn't we
 
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
conversions you and me we did didn't we
yeah

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
we hope it's never mind
 
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.750 align:start position:0%
we hope it's never mind
no

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.629 align:start position:0%
no
uh

00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
now house bill 247 is dr nagel here
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure okay and that we're
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
going to be taking another bill out of
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
order after this one so you can get back
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
to your patients doctor you are
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
247 relative to treatment alternatives
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
for opioids and
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
get something to say put your hand up
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
what do you think
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
what do you think about the bill
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
i still have a lot of concerns about
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
this particular bill because
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
the idea of non
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
the non-opioid directive
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
um is a problem for me were they really
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
we don't normally legislate the practice
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
of medicine and there's really no
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
precedent for leg for sort of
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
legislating a sequence of treatment that
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
is offered
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of this was in response to the
 
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.590 align:start position:0%
a lot of this was in response to the
opioid

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
opioid
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
death crisis which is a real issue
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
but what's important is that that the
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
over prescribing was such a deal for
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
such a long time but we have really
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot of control and the data has
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
shown that the opioid prescribing has
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
dropped an immense amount
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
the deaths continue to increase and of
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
course many of them are from fentanyl
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
which is not a diverted generally
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's not because of diversion
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
so i think there's less reason for this
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
non-operating directive but there are
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
some really big concerns and this
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
harkens back to back when i was in
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
practice because
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
as a spine doc i would see people who
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
have been started on opioids and those
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
would be paid for for example because i
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
was a border town
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
in maine they'd buy all the opioids
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
you'd want they'd only get you two
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
sessions of physical therapy if you're
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
on main medicaid physical therapy is a
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
far better proven treatment for back
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
pain than our opioids
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
and this is actually often just for
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
acute back pain or sub uh you know sort
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
of short term but not necessarily even
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
chronic the issue is
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
there are concerns on coverage now
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid is obviously a state issue but
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
the insurances also don't cover some of
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
the things it's hard to get coverage for
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
cognitive behavioral therapy which is a
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
great treatment
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
for chronic pain
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
but you get all the pills you want and
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
all the injections you want and you can
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
kind of break it down into the dr fix me
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
jobs those are things like chiropractic
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
injections pills
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
versus the self-actualization which is
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
what you really need in the management
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
of chronic pain and those are things
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
such as cognitive behavioral therapy
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
acceptance therapy physical therapy
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
lifestyle changes
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
those have a far better track record in
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
managing chronic pain particularly in my
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
case back pain which is the most common
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
chronic pain
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
then are opioids and many times
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
injections they have their place but
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
they have a very small place so there
 
00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:19.750 align:start position:0%
they have a very small place so there
are

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
coverage issues but the problem with
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
that is that's not a job for our
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
committee we know that that falls in the
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
purview of commerce
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
we decide something's a good treatment
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
but their job is to look at the whole
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
question of coverage and that's if this
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
bill comes back it should go to commerce
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i think one should strip out all the
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
non-opioid directive and all that
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
stuff of dictating to docs what order
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
they have to do things and instead
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
just look at the question of how do we
 
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.310 align:start position:0%
just look at the question of how do we
cover

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
the appropriate therapy and it could
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
even be labeled
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
as a title for the bill support for
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
effective pain care but even this gets a
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
little dicey in terms of trying to
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislate the practice of medicine but
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
in this case it's more legislating that
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
there'd be coverage for appropriate
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
interventions that do have good
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
good evidence um
 
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.029 align:start position:0%
good evidence um
so

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
my thought is that we
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
we that this bill should be itl
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
if the sponsor wants to bring it back it
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
should come back with something that
 
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.150 align:start position:0%
should come back with something that
would

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
have to do with instead coverage issues
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
in commerce for
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
effective pain management i know that's
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
kind of a long-winded thing but this was
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
my life this is what i spent all my
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
years treating was chronic pain
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
although our breakfasts are not tax
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
deductible my wife and i often speak
 
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
deductible my wife and i often speak
business

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
during breakfast and she tells me that
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
it is her belief that catholic medical
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
center has a handout paper that they
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
give to people that make suggestions and
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
so on so i wonder if
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
the bill's sponsors might not
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
touch base with that as a recommendation
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh representative shapiro yes thank you
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman my concern with the
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
with the part of the bill that mandates
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
coverage from
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
insurances for various activities is
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
just that
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how to solve this
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
problem but it seems random to choose
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
certain services such as yoga therapy um
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
how about tai chi um how about
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
other things that people do that feel is
 
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
really helpful to them i don't really
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
know how to solve that problem
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
maybe if there's going to be mandated
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
coverage to do it in a more generalized
 
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.510 align:start position:0%
coverage to do it in a more generalized
way

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
although i don't think that's a good fit
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
i see that as a real problem kind of
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing specific
 
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.789 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing specific
um

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
therapeutic activities which means
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
you're not picking and choosing others
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't really know how to solve
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
that problem thank you representative
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and i think i think we're all
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
arguing in the same direction although
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
how we get there we may have some
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
disagreements i i
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
very much agree
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
i think we've covered the medical
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
aspects of it and and i very much agree
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
with representative shapiro that
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
um excluding you know favoring one is to
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
exclude another and that is not helpful
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
because we all know that different
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
things work for different people
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
but i have also worked extensively with
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
our colleagues on the commerce committee
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
on medical coverage issues
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i know that for them
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
the most
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
likely thing that you can do to get
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
something through that committee on
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
medical coverage is to make it as narrow
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
as possible rather than as broad as
 
00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:43.830 align:start position:0%
as possible rather than as broad as
possible

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.029 align:start position:0%
possible
so

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
tactically what one might want to do is
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
first of all start with
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
the professions that are the most
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
licensed and regulated
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
because people will be more comfortable
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
with that in an insurance capacity
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
and think about mandating
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
certain coverage
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
for say
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care or osteopathic care
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
because then when we get past that
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of disciplines that are
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
far less regulated far less certified
 
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.470 align:start position:0%
far less regulated far less certified
and

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.590 align:start position:0%
and
you

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
the more you get into territory where
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
anybody can call themselves a
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
practitioner of whatever the particular
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
discipline is the less
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
likely it is that anybody's going to
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
approve coverage for that because
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to be uncomfortable as to
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
who's getting paid and
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
what the quality of the care is going to
 
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
what the quality of the care is going to
be

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion would be to perhaps
 
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion would be to perhaps
start

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
but i i do think that people are far
 
00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:05.909 align:start position:0%
but i i do think that people are far
more

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
tuned in at this point
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
to the need for alternative therapies
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the effectiveness of alternative
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
therapies but i want a second what
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
everybody else has said is the issue is
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
getting them paid for and
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
and that's my suggestion as to how you
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
do it but there may be other ways as
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i agree that
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
the real issue here isn't about the
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
availability it's about the paid for
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
access so this should be something that
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
moves to commerce i do think that we
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
need to look broader than just the
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
providers who are part of this because
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
there are technologies especially the
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
tens units the transcutaneous electro
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
electrical nerve stimulation there's
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
some that are a lot easier for patients
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
to apply this isn't the old one with
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
leads that are everywhere one actually
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
helped me rehab from my broken femur
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
about 10 years after because i could
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
finally work through the pain
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that it's important not just
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
to look at specialties but also to look
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
at some of these devices especially
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
those that came through the 510k process
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
so they don't have the same approval
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
that you would need for one of these one
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
of these really really expensive device
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
approvals but they help they do have
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
data and if this is something that will
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
be able to address people's pain get
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
them back on their feet back doing what
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
they need to do and get them out of this
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
debilitating and mentally crushing pain
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
i think it would be critical to make
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
sure that we have access for devices
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
um y'all make really great points that i
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
think ought to be incorporated
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill i think we should resubmit
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
the bill with the the updates that we're
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
thinking of
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
i can't take credit for anything except
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
noticing that on roman numeral one on
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
and line twenty they seem to be
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
contradictory uh line nine
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
we can add
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
fine tune it but on line 20 it says a
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
really good thing nothing in this
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
section shall preclude a health care
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
practitioner from simultaneously
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
prescribing an opioid and prescribing or
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
recommending any of these procedures
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
whereas line nine is written
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
well you have to order this first
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
before you do an opioid so they seem
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
contradictory that's something i think
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
the wording could be addressed
 
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.390 align:start position:0%
the wording could be addressed
we

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
it may feel awkward to say we're
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
specifying certain things and not others
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
many years ago
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
when i was going through a divorce and
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to go through counseling
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
i discovered
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
insurance from state to state really
 
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.630 align:start position:0%
insurance from state to state really
varied

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
varied
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
on coverage so in massachusetts it was
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
something you know you expect
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
massachusetts to be very generous
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in those days 500 was a
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
lot of money and that was how much they
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
would cover in mass in new hampshire and
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
way less than mass so that really
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
surprised me so i mean we do have a
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
history of deciding
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
in by rsa
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh coverage
 
00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
uh coverage
so

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
we're not treading on ground that's
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
never been walked on before
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative canark i think
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
you want to follow up on that point
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
actually follow up and also make one
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
other comment i cannot believe i didn't
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
make a statement earlier when we talked
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
about what's excluded
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
though it would be very difficult to get
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for this as all you
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
know i'm the chair of the therapeutic
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board and
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
actually one of the best
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
proven benefits of therapeutic cannabis
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
is in pain and in fact about half of our
 
00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:46.310 align:start position:0%
is in pain and in fact about half of our
patients

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh many of them in our age group i mean
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
the median age group is 55 to 65
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
are certified for chronic pain that is
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
our most common thing and it has
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely very good uh benefit however
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
it'll be a little dicey trying to
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
mandate insurance coverage for that
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
given the federal status as a schedule
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
one drug
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
so that's out the picture but it's sad
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
because that's also one of those ones
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
often underused in response to that
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
question of the conflict you're right
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
there was a clear conflict on how that
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
was worded i objected to that when we
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
had the hearing is that it doesn't make
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
sense to sequence this
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
because there are times and i used to
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
frequently get semi-started on pt and
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
continue their opioids because i
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
inherited them on opioids
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing is in terms of
 
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.430 align:start position:0%
the other thing is in terms of
approval

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
um even for tech for devices and so on
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
i did serve a little while after i
 
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.029 align:start position:0%
i did serve a little while after i
retired

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
retired
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
doing some technical reviews for some of
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies just to review
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
data on interventions to see whether or
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
not they should or shouldn't cover it
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
and as much as we sometimes disagree
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
with our insurance colleagues and
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
looking out at
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
heidi kroll out there about coverage
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
they do try to you know do a decent job
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
of looking at it but they are too quick
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
to cover
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
um procedures interventions pills and
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
not the other things that are softer
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
which again are difficult represent
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative weber made a great point
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
about the fact that those who are highly
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
regulated that came up in the hearings
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know yoga that's not regulated so
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a real problem in terms
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
of doing reimbursement whereas pt ot
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
those things are highly regulated and
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
certified and you know what you're
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
getting with those and of course they're
 
00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:21.990 align:start position:0%
getting with those and of course they're
already

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
covered and many insurance companies
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
already cover chiropractic
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
many insurance companies already cover
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
acupuncture and osteopathic anyway so
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that is covered and i
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
think this is one of the difficulties is
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
this fine-tuning
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
that process legislatively uh is always
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
a little bit difficult just we want to
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
make sure people have appropriate
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
coverage thank you thank you
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative representative shapiro
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll make a
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
disclaimer and say i'm going to talk
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
about something i know nothing about um
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
we do that all the time here sir thank
 
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.070 align:start position:0%
we do that all the time here sir thank
you

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
well we do that i thought you said you
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
i am part of we
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
so in any case um since it's so hard to
 
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.590 align:start position:0%
so in any case um since it's so hard to
discern

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
discern
 
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.470 align:start position:0%
discern
which

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
technologies

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
um our best or should have approval and
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have approval and
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
through the commerce committee if
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
something couldn't be done to kind of
 
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.510 align:start position:0%
something couldn't be done to kind of
encourage

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
to do a more thorough search on what is
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
useful and what isn't useful something
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
about the process by which people
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
petition to have something covered and
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
how the insurance companies respond to
 
00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:46.549 align:start position:0%
how the insurance companies respond to
that

00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
maybe legislation could affect that
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
process maybe i don't even know if there
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
is a process
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
rather than the legislature mandating
 
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.710 align:start position:0%
rather than the legislature mandating
specific

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh we will send
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
a copy of all of this to representative
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt for his summer reading
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
pleasure representative woods ah thank
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
you mr chair um i'd i'd like to take
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
more just to make a couple comments
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh how did we get here if we don't know
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
how we got here we don't know how we can
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
correct it
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh one of the problems is starting in
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
the 90s we decided we're going to
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
deliver health care
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
on a market-based system rather than a
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
government-based system
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
that involved big pharma and we all know
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
what happened with purdue and we've seen
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff on tv
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:43.029 align:start position:0%
and so that
aspect

00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
became a public entity
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
the other part was perhaps because of a
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
deficiency in medicine
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
we weren't handling
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
patients very well
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
fortunately i didn't have to because i
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
had in my office dr nagle
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
if there was an opioid patient i would
 
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.430 align:start position:0%
if there was an opioid patient i would
say

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
i know just who you need to see
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
so i always had an out by the same token
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
the government got involved and said
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're not taking good care of your
 
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.669 align:start position:0%
you're not taking good care of your
patients

00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
and you need to understand what pain is
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
you you have to check when you come in
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
the office what's your pain one to ten
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
when you leave the office what's your
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
pain one to ten
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
and when you get on the phone well
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
what's your pain one to ten
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
and we had this one to ten and the
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
public became
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
very intimately aware that oh
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
maybe i should be getting something
 
00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:39.029 align:start position:0%
maybe i should be getting something
and

00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
the conflation
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the pharmacy
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
the conflation of the government and
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
even looking at our chart if they were
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
to review your chart and you weren't
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
doing adequate one to ten measures in
 
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
doing adequate one to ten measures in
your

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
then you were dinged financially
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh they would retract some of your
 
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.310 align:start position:0%
uh they would retract some of your
reimbursement

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
um so there was a there's this feedback
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
and some of that is fortunately
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh we've become more aware of the
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
pharmacy part
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
okay uh we become more aware um that in
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
fact we need when we say one to ten that
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
needs to be put in perspective
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh and the medical community is
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
fortunately helping to balance that so i
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
think some of these forces
 
00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.750 align:start position:0%
think some of these forces
are

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh in that pendulum swing and we're
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
caught in the middle of this at the
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
moment the thing we don't want to do is
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
do like we did here in the latest and
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
not we i wasn't here at the time but
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
i forgot how many years ago say 20 years
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
ago there was a hue and cry in the
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
legislature for coverage of bone marrow
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
transplants for
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
breast cancer treatment
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
and uh the medical community says no i
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anything about that
 
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anything about that
um

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the legislature in its
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
infinite wisdom
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
said uh yeah let's uh yeah let's let's
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead let's do that but within six
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
months of passing the legislation it was
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
found that in fact as the medical
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
community said there is no rational
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
basis for it and it's not used
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
we don't want to fall into that trap so
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
i i just want to offer a couple of 30
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
000 foot
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
comments in light of that representative
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
i made the mistake once this one to 10
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
scale kicked in
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
of saying my pain is three at which
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
point the doctor said oh if it's only
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
that go home and watch reruns of
 
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.110 align:start position:0%
that go home and watch reruns of
seinfeld

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
seinfeld
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
and it'll be good for you so after that
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
i always said 10 and they said why 10 i
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
says because it's my pain
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
and if i say 10 i'm much more likely to
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
be taken seriously realizing the whole
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
thing was a farce yeah thank you
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
i do agree that this is probably more of
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
an economic issue than a medical one
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
however when i say that
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
if this committee does support
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
a policy saying these are therapies that
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
should be considered for treatment it
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
does help i think in swaying people to
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
understand what they should be looking
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
for economically to support
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
in saying that too i did speak out to
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor dr lagran
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative lundgren
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
and he is willing to put together an ad
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
hoc group for the summer and i've
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
invited the stakeholders including
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
heidi kroll reached out to heidi as far
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
as the insurance company because they're
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
critical piece to it and talk about this
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
issue of what can we do collectively
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
to solve this issue
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
legislatively and so forth so we are in
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
a process with dr nagle some other folks
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
to actually pull together some
 
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.549 align:start position:0%
to actually pull together some
stakeholders

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
to form an ad hoc group
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
to work on it
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's a question at this
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
point in time what this committee does
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
but to let you folks know there is a
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
group of us trying to get together and
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
talk about it collectively to try to
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
reach some sort of consensus because
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
i totally agree with representative
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
connor dr kanark
 
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.549 align:start position:0%
connor dr kanark
um

00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to do is tell the
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
medical community how the practice
 
00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.669 align:start position:0%
medical community how the practice
however

00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
we need to be sure that there's a
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
part behind what we're trying to say is
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
that from the legislative body we
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
believe these are things that should be
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
considered to be covered how they get
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
covered there's probably many ways to
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
skin the cat but without having the
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies at the table it's
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay let's wrap this up i think we have
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
i i know
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
the point of order i just
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call on you but i'm saying
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
let's wrap this up so that we can move
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
on to the next thing and these notes
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
will be passed on to that ad hoc
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative kenner yes
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
actually all i want to do is ask if we
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
could since dr nagel was kind enough to
 
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.909 align:start position:0%
could since dr nagel was kind enough to
come

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
and spend his time listening to all of
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
us talking about his specialty
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
i know that this is not a testimony but
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
could we ask him for his input and his
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
feelings about what we have just said
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
and whether he thinks we're on the right
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
track dr nagle would you come up and
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
tell us if you think we're on the right
 
00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:54.310 align:start position:0%
tell us if you think we're on the right
track

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
track
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
if i one of the other things too i
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
talked to dr nagle beforehand
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
is on senate bill 290 which is arico
 
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.310 align:start position:0%
is on senate bill 290 which is arico
therapy

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
this is also dealing with pain
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe one of the things for us to
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
consider and look to hear from dr nagle
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
his thoughts on this
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
should we merge the two of these
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
together into one hot group and saying
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
why don't we talk about this
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
collectively holistically and i'll break
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
it apart
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
so you have any comments thank you
 
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.150 align:start position:0%
so you have any comments thank you
mister

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
mister
 
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.750 align:start position:0%
mister
um

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
because dr nagel will be addressing 290
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
290 will be taken out of order next so
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
he can get back to his patients and um
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
first you examine it
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
all right wow and you then you get a
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm gonna have to call my
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
secretary now
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'll be back in about four weeks um
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's the next discussion we'll have is
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
on that but anyway that's the commerce
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
committee too i guess
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
um do i need to reintroduce myself
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay i'm dr david nagle um i've been
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
practicing pain management and conquer
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
and concord for 32 years
 
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.349 align:start position:0%
and concord for 32 years
um

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
i've been involved in legislation for
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
the prescription of opioids since 1998.
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
um i actually helped write the first set
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
of rules regarding opioid prescribing
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
our see our our purpose has always been
 
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.670 align:start position:0%
our see our our purpose has always been
to

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
have a balance between the issues of
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
pain and addiction and i will take an
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
issue with the statements that have been
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
made about opioids
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
they do have value for people with both
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
acute pain chronic pain and especially
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
end of life pain and because of public
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
policies that have been coming about
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
this being one of the cdc
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing a decreased access to
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
care because of these people with that
 
00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:50.550 align:start position:0%
care because of these people with that
said

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
the other role that i've been playing in
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
addition all my roles within the state
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
is i've been sharing the nfl pain
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
management committee for the last five
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
years nflp being uh an actual football
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
league players association oh yeah yeah
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
so um i was asked to share their pain
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
management best practices committee and
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
the nice thing about that is i've got
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
interview a lot of people that have a
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
lot of money while they're playing
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
football and i've been able to find out
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
what helps them and what doesn't help
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
them we don't have a great evidence base
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
for outcomes in terms of single modality
 
00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:24.790 align:start position:0%
for outcomes in terms of single modality
therapies

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
therapies
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
we generally feel that most treatments
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
involve multiple modalities used
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
together we certainly learned that from
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
the nfl players the difference between
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
them and the public and them and when
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
they retire
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
has to come down to cost
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
who pays for this how do you pay for
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing but we've discovered
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that actually have a lot
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
of benefit that work really well that
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
people don't have access we've been
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
saying forever that um
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
if all you're going to pay for is pills
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
and procedures don't be surprised when
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
people just get pills and procedures
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's really got to change and
 
00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:58.230 align:start position:0%
it's it's really got to change and
there's

00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
an incentive for you to do this now i
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
brought a copy of this for each one of
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
you to read the next 10 minutes
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
as i think you're fully aware the cdc
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
changed the entire dialogue on pain
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
management opioid management united
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
states when they released their guides
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
in 2016 this is the updated draft
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
within this draft is a statement that
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
the right authors of this guide
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
feel that access to alternative
 
00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.430 align:start position:0%
feel that access to alternative
therapies

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
therapies
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
is extremely important and that they
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
will do whatever they need to do to make
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
sure that that happens so i think that
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has an opportunity to be
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
one of the first states united states to
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
actually enact this kind of legislation
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's done to this committee
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
commerce or whatever
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
it it's really important the problem
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
that we had with
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
247 was the whole statement about
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
opioids and its entire um
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
persistence on alternatives to opioids
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
you need to do this need to do that and
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
we've actually talked with
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative lundgren we wrote an
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
amended version of it and he really
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
liked what we wrote
 
00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:02.230 align:start position:0%
liked what we wrote
so

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
i think what i'm saying is that number
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
one is please don't punish people that
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
aren't opioids because they are
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
benefiting from them there are
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
definitely people that do secondly
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
increase access to alternative therapies
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
and we need to find a strategy for doing
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
this i think this bill is a starting
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
point but it needs a lot of work um and
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
gary and i have been our representative
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
merchants sorry
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i have been talking about this for
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
years now about trying to make this real
 
00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:30.710 align:start position:0%
years now about trying to make this real
um

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.670 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so i think in a sense you are on the
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
right track
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
in a long-winded way
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has any questions
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
comments thoughts
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
the chair does
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
dr representative kenner and i will be
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to atlanta the end of the month
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
for four days and part of what we will
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
be doing we'll be talking with senior
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
people from the cdc great hey so um
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
do you want me to give you a list of all
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
the problems with this i'm sure
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's excess baggage yeah for our plane
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
flight yeah
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
um representative weber i was just going
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
to ask if he could perhaps pass that out
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
so we could be looking over it while
 
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.790 align:start position:0%
so we could be looking over it while
he's

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
he's
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
while we're finishing up
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
are you are you serious
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'm terribly sorry i heard you to say i
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
brought a copy for everyone and i was
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
joking i'm sorry i i i can't i'm not
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
that stupid i
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
but you know what i
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
no no if you want i can get you access
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
to this it's a really important document
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very important document could you
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
give the representative and me a cliff
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay and to the committee sure i mean
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's past what we're going to be
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
voting but we are going to atlanta so it
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful this is a draft at
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
this point so it's not a final version
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
understood important so yeah i can do
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
you can you may we we all of us love
 
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.630 align:start position:0%
you can you may we we all of us love
policy

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
but our task today is to say recommended
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
for further legislation or not
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation not
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
to discuss what the legislation
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
is going to be in its minute details
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
and if we are to get out of here at a
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable time
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest that
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
you know we're exceeding the task in
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
front of us we are doing that and would
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
somebody like to make a motion
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative weber would that way i
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
remember what the motion's supposed to
 
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:48.550 align:start position:0%
remember what the motion's supposed to
be

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
sure i
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
i would make a motion but i my motion
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
would be recommended for further
 
00:41:53.839 --> 00:41:55.589 align:start position:0%
would be recommended for further
legislation

00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
legislation
um

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.510 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
if because i made the motion i would be
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
constrained to write the blurb
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
what i would say in the blurb was that
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
thought it would be wise to focus
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
on the issues of
 
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
on the issues of
[Music]

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
access and affordability not only to
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
these modalities but to others
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
would that would that be an appropriate
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
statement i was planning on writing
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
be my guest
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
and including what uh my clerk has
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
written so be my guest get the sense of
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
the meeting and do with it whatever they
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
wish so the moment in that case the
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
motion is simply recommended for further
 
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.030 align:start position:0%
motion is simply recommended for further
legislation

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%

10-year mental health plan that we have
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
this ad hoc committee on just the
 
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.910 align:start position:0%
this ad hoc committee on just the
developmental

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities section of it i may have
 
00:44:29.359 --> 00:44:30.630 align:start position:0%
disabilities section of it i may have
confused

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
confused
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
you with handing out a 10-year plan in
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
general that's not what we're going to
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
deal with i just had extra copies and
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
thought people might like it we are
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
going in the ad hoc committee to
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
look at just the developmental
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities part thank you so much for
 
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.390 align:start position:0%
disabilities part thank you so much for
that

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at senate bill 290
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
now this bill permits with certain
 
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
limitations the practice of
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
auriculotherapy i have been rehearsing
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
that one or the practice of inserting
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
needles into the external human
 
00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:08.550 align:start position:0%
needles into the external human
ear

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
ear
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
and open for comments
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman if we think back
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the hearing on this the stakeholders
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
who brought this forward
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
intended for the legislation to be very
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
different than what was actually brought
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
forward i think that they had some great
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
discussions and
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
looking to the intent that they shared
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
with us i think is a lot more important
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
to sort of sketch that out before
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
anybody gets around to working on the
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
rsas and the idea of putting this
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
together with house bill 247 as we're
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
discussing pain management i think is
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
brilliant and i think that that would be
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
a wonderful step forward to move this
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
forward for future legislation without
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
well looking at it holistically so thank
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
you for that idea
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
i want to thank dr michael
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
i just want to recognize that where the
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
thought came from was dr nagle so i want
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
to recognize dr nagle and his brilliance
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
well you're in the best committee in the
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
mike on sir
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
microphone on
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's right i do and now i have no
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
excuse because you're not sitting next
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
to the clerks or that is why
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
yeah that's true she takes care
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative soloway will please uh
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
assume that responsibility for the
 
00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:40.470 align:start position:0%
assume that responsibility for the
duration

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
duration
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
i must say i i i listened very carefully
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
to this testimony about this bill and
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
the only concern i have it came up in
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note which was
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
that this bill the way it's written may
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
lead to an excessive amount of court
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
activity and they couldn't really judge
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
what the impact is going to be on the
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
court system what it's saying is that
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
anybody that advertises that this method
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
will solve any problem like deafness
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh alcoholism smoking any of those
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
things and the person is then liable and
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's also subject to civil action
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
and i think the court's very concerned
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
that they could be overwhelmed and
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
that's a system that's already very
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
strained so i think that's an issue you
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
really have to take into consideration
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
when you do this i recall the attempt to
 
00:47:30.079 --> 00:47:30.950 align:start position:0%
when you do this i recall the attempt to
say

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
come to us because you'll feel better
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
without saying come to us because you'll
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
feel better and that really concerned me
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit too much of
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
wink-wink nudge-nudge in there and
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's where legislation's going to come
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
well they kind of told me if i did this
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
such and such might happen and what
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
exactly was said and wasn't said and
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
what was heard and the speaker should be
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
responsible sometimes for false hearing
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
my general attitude on all of this is i
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
am much in favor of steps in the process
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners before we had a jump
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
from an rn to a do or an md now we have
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
physicians assistants and nurse
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
practitioners and so many of the
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
professions have such
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
immediate steps and while i'm in favor
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
of that i don't know any of those
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
intermediate steps that don't have to be
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
trained licensed supervised and so on so
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
i'm all in favor of let's carve out
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
another step provided that it isn't joe
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
schmo walking in off the street corner
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
and sticking a needle in somebody's ear
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
so my attitude is if the licensing board
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
of acupuncture wishes to develop
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
protocols and standards and licensure
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
and supervision of individuals
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
practicing auriculotherapy
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
go for it but absent that we should keep
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
our hands off that that's just kind of
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
next door neighbor representative canark
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
i was just shaking my head to agree with
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you i appreciate that i heard
 
00:49:05.119 --> 00:49:06.950 align:start position:0%
you thank you i appreciate that i heard
you

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay um i do have one concern about
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
rolling 290 in with 247
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
because 290 even though again wink wink
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
not not does not report to treat any
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
disease and so on it was being discussed
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
as issues to
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
for mental health for behavioral health
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
for addiction for a lot of things other
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
than pain
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
so it was a little bit of a standalone
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
that was broader than just pain
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
my worry is
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
there are so many good things about
 
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.470 align:start position:0%
there are so many good things about
potentially

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
getting coverage with 247
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want this portion of the of a
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
bill if this if this were rolled with it
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
to undermine the chance of getting the
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
other portion of the bill obviously they
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
could just be stripped out but then
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's then this is never
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
addressed in other words if uh
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
if some
 
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill as we all hate made it to
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
commerce and they decided to strip out
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
the language on 290 then nothing happens
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
to it if they come as two separate bills
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
they can be each judged on their own
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
merit and that may be more productive
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
your ad hoc group though may still do
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
some work on that for the issue the
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
chronic pain but since they were
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
presenting this even though they
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
purported doesn't treat disease
 
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.710 align:start position:0%
purported doesn't treat disease
as

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
making having benefits far beyond pain i
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
think it may be hard to try to link it
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
with it that was a concern i had
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative merchants speak to that
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
if you would yes thank you i
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
think the merits of having eventually
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
possibly two bills going through the
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
system versus one being locked together
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
has some real marriage to it however the
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
stakeholder community that would be
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
looking at this collectively probably
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
the same stakeholder community so we're
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
trying to at that point in time
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
work on them simultaneously with the
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholder community and leave it up to
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
a stakeholder community where they
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to divide it or leave it combined
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
but i think at this point in time the
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
logic of having that stakeholder
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
community ad hoc group look at this at
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
the same time as looking at pain would
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
still be there
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
sounds good i saw hand over here
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to clarify following on
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
the remarks of the chair
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
the boards can't
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
i don't believe create new licenses in
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
of themselves we have to authorize that
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
and then they do the rules they can't do
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
rule making except as authorized by us
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
just saying we're going to leave it to
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
the board is is not fair because
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
they have to have some kind of
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
authorization i think i think that the
 
00:51:36.559 --> 00:51:38.150 align:start position:0%
authorization i think i think that the
um

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing here is is that
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh we are all for pursuing these
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
therapies provided that they are
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately regulated and either
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
certified or licensed or credentialed in
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
in some manner
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
but that the complete deregulation
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
i would want to see the
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
statement that the complete deregulation
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
is not something that i would
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
ever be voting for i will i want to see
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
a pro a path
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
towards appropriate training and and
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh utilization of the methodology but
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
with appropriate training i concur with
 
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.109 align:start position:0%
with appropriate training i concur with
that

00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
would we say then that a bill could be
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
brought forward saying
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature authorizes the licensing
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
board of acupuncture to develop
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
protocols for auriculotherapy
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
licensing training and so on and that
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
would probably well that go to eda
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
probably but it
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
might yeah okay does that sound good
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
when we listened to the testimony on
 
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.589 align:start position:0%
when we listened to the testimony on
this

00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
um i was trying to find my notes this
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
morning because the impression i got was
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
that it was being proposed as a very
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
helpful treatment as people were trying
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
to overcome drug addiction there's
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that says what this
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
is for
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh and if
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
and it was also trying to
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
say that the person could do this could
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
be trained to do this one
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
one part of the body
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh without having to be certified for
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
the whole body treatment which meant
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
that it would be a lot less expensive
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh at least that was my interpretation
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
that you could train
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
multiple people
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
whereas we don't have you know we'd have
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more people
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
to to do the treatment so i would like
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
to see that put back in the bill rather
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
than make this sound like a general
 
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.910 align:start position:0%
than make this sound like a general
treatment

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.430 align:start position:0%
treatment
um

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i definitely i thought
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
we all recognized that there was nothing
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
in this bill that talked about training
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
or certification so definitely i would
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
like purpose
 
00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.270 align:start position:0%
like purpose
training

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
and certification to be put in and i
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
would like this to be developed
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
into a real
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know an effective bill
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro thank you mr
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
chairman i believe that this already um
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
this regular therapy is already a sub
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
certification under the acupuncture
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
board already and
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe as representative leon said
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
um really didn't read the way people
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
intended it to but
 
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.549 align:start position:0%
intended it to but
um

00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
what it seemed to do was
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
expand that certification that's already
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
present under the board but reduce the
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
amount of training reduce the amount of
 
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.870 align:start position:0%
amount of training reduce the amount of
accountability

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.670 align:start position:0%
accountability
and

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
make more vague what it's actually for
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
while the board of acupuncture can't
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
create new boards
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
we should be looking to them to see
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
and since they were opposed to the bill
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
as it was
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
we should be looking to them to see how
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
they might want to expand the services
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
that were able to be provided but with
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
the accountability with the um
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
you know with clear limitations on what
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
this was what these services were for
 
00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.069 align:start position:0%
this was what these services were for
so

00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
if i hear you correctly we are to ask
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
the acupuncture board
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
to revisit this in the light of what
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing and hearing and
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
come up with protocols
 
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.270 align:start position:0%
come up with protocols
that

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to avoid a judgment word here
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
a nice word for more reasonable okay
 
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.430 align:start position:0%
a nice word for more reasonable okay
yeah

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
you doable that doesn't compromise the
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
integrity of the importance of training
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
licensing supervision and all of that
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
but could expand
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.430 align:start position:0%
but could expand
what

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
people can do at that level
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
um they're sort of nodding
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick response to that the
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
the testimony that was provided by the
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire acupuncture nation
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
medicine association
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
um really made the point that irregular
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
therapy is already part of standard
 
00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:16.710 align:start position:0%
therapy is already part of standard
acupuncture

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
acupuncture
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to see an
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
interesting turf battle i'm not quite
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
sure they're going to carve out some
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
small subgroup well thus they're
 
00:56:23.359 --> 00:56:24.309 align:start position:0%
small subgroup well thus they're
training

00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think this is again i'm not sure how
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
much we can charge them to come up with
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
an answer to this um as we saw there was
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
a conflict because the person who
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
presented i think it was elizabeth rob
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
or the other person had been trying to
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
get a certification course no plc was
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
not interested in kind of covering the
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
course as it was defined
 
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.390 align:start position:0%
course as it was defined
so

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
this is something that i'm not sure
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to get together and
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
suddenly come up with a kumbaya moment
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
and have an answer on that i'm not sure
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think looks like gary has something to
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
say about that i'm going to call on
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative weber first of course
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
the eyes in the back my head will work
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
once again i think we are at the point
 
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.710 align:start position:0%
once again i think we are at the point
where

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
that is something that needs to be
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
addressed by those people who are
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
interested in pursuing the legislation
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate people and part of
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
that is a discussion with the folks at
 
00:57:19.119 --> 00:57:20.549 align:start position:0%
that is a discussion with the folks at
oaplc

00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
oaplc
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
authority that they have the authority
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have what they're willing to
 
00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.549 align:start position:0%
they don't have what they're willing to
do

00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
and then an evaluation of whether we the
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislature want to simply affirm that
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
or want to change the scheme as it
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
currently is but that's not a decision
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
that i think we're going to resolve
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
today because that's
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
why we interim studied the bill to begin
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
with so i would move um
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation if
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
that is an appropriate motion at this
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
time mr chair uh i would hold that for a
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
minute because i have a few people who
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
would still like to speak and
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative cofoult
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yeah i'll i'll be
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
quick i i i just think uh somebody i
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
know somebody who benefited from
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
this treatment by a certified
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist some years ago we heard dr
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
nagle say a few minutes ago that one of
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
the most important things that we can do
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
is to expand access to alternative
 
00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.870 align:start position:0%
is to expand access to alternative
treatments

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
and as such
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
um i think we're all clear that this
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
needs to take some um different form
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
than the form that it came to us in but
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh important and i i will
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
be supporting the uh the motion thank
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative snow hey
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
line 14 and 15 on the bill
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm the only one in the room that
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand this any person who
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
violates the vision of this section
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of a class a misdemeanor
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
if a natural person in a felony if an
 
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.750 align:start position:0%
if a natural person in a felony if an
other

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
person what is the difference between a
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
natural i've always wondered that
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
thinking like
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
a supernatural person like an angel or
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
something you know i really wondered
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative weber knows
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
a natural person is a human being
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
corporations in this country in in
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
legal parliaments are also persons which
 
00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:19.349 align:start position:0%
legal parliaments are also persons which
is

00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
bewildering but a legal
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
reality but they are not natural persons
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
any other that's the cooperation i i
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
think i think getting into
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
the specifics of a bill that we don't
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
think ought to go forward in its current
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions that the
 
00:59:48.799 --> 00:59:50.150 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions that the
acupuncture

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
acupuncture
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
board is going to look at is to what
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
degree do you think it is appropriate to
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
carve out
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
one aspect and i don't mean to be snarky
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
but let me give you an example
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
if ears
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
are a carve out with specific training
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
practice limited to ears
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
could we do one for shoulders
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not making fun of it i'm just
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
saying if you carve out one thing
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
why this thing and that would be
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
something you would wrestle with and
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
also at the same time wonder if you want
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
to go carve out some other things too
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
and so i agree
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
dr woods the final speaker and then i'll
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
take the motion uh yeah i understand
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
you're i understand your concern but
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
years ago many years ago my
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
great-great-grandfather was a
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
self-taught horseback doctor
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh we eventually got uh
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
surgeons and internists and the surgeons
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
became this and that and the other thing
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
and lo and behold
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
i became a hand surgeon
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
and we carved that out and i jokingly
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
said i even just do the left hand
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
because it's so
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
the right hand is too complicated
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think this is a natural progression
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i think if it's done under the aegis
 
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.710 align:start position:0%
and i think if it's done under the aegis
of

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
manpower usage which i think is one of
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
the issues
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
but just just because
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
we need more vascular surgeons doesn't
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
mean you hire a plumber because they
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
deal with fluid in pipes
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
so my sense is
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
under the right circumstances and this
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
is the question i think and we should
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
have a look at this
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
and to see if it can be expanded along
 
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
those bases i think it's a natural
 
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.349 align:start position:0%
those bases i think it's a natural
progression

01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
progression

not without permission indeed so
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
and the chair just offers as an aside
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
how well the clerk is
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
doing and we have a
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
and not run away
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming folks
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
you see and why you feel so at home here
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
this committee is not above a good
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
i'm glad we're going to go forward with
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
ad hoc
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're well they i will anoint them if
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
let's be a little careful here i mean
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
you have one ad hoc committee that you
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
have appointed that is a subcommittee of
 
01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.470 align:start position:0%
have appointed that is a subcommittee of
this

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee and it's labeled an ad hoc
 
01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.150 align:start position:0%
committee and it's labeled an ad hoc
committee

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.349 align:start position:0%
committee
any

01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
set of members that is less than a
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
quorum of this committee can get
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
together and discuss whatever they want
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
with anybody they want at any time they
 
01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.510 align:start position:0%
with anybody they want at any time they
want

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
but if
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
they are more than a quorum of this
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
committee unless they are a political
 
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.789 align:start position:0%
committee unless they are a political
caucus

01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
they may not meet without following
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
the dictates of 91a so if there's a
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
smaller group of five or seven people or
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
nine people who actually want to just
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
get together and talk to this
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
you can do that but it's i want to make
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
it clear it's not an official committee
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of ways to do it and
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
and if i may mr chair
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
what often happens
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
the whole committee or a subsection of
 
01:06:14.319 --> 01:06:15.029 align:start position:0%
the whole committee or a subsection of
it

01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
works on a bill all
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
summer sometimes that has happened
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes people have done as our chair
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
has chosen to do is say we are going to
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
and there is no further obligation once
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
we have taken the vote
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
there's no further obligation on this
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
committee as a committee
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
but any member who wishes to work on an
 
01:06:40.799 --> 01:06:42.069 align:start position:0%
but any member who wishes to work on an
issue

01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
has that right so long as they don't run
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
afoul of the right to know law it's just
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
it's not an official
 
01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:49.829 align:start position:0%
it's not an official
anything

01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
those are the two ways we've done things
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
i mean if if a committee chooses to work
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
on the interim study bill as a committee
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
then you don't vote on it till sometime
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
in october
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
but that's not the route that we've
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
chosen here
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
the developmental
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
delay group
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
an official
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is because first of all
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
that council
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
by law
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
reports to the committee
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
so there is an official thing that isn't
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
in these other groups and secondly
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
several of us in this room are members
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the joint legislative dhhs oversight
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
committee where dhhs reports
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
so because of those official connections
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
it seemed better to me to make this an
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
official ad hoc group of or subcommittee
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee and let the other ones
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
go the way
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
we can with more flexibility
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh is it a violation 91a since we won't
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
have a new bill
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
officially named is it a violation of
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
91a if we just all emailed each other as
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
we thought of things would that be a way
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
for everybody to participate who wants
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
to without violating anything
 
01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.430 align:start position:0%
to without violating anything
um

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
it is somewhat sketchy because we
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
even though we voted on it we still have
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
a bill in front of us i don't know and i
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
would direct that question to house
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
counsel because i'm not going to
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
whoever's yeah whoever's pulling these
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
groups together should get clearance as
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
i did from the speaker's office about
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
the official subcommittee but but the
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the issue of emailing the entire
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
committee and having a discussion among
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
the entire committee that is out of the
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
purview of the public eye
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
is really
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
not a good policy in my opinion that's
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
just my opinion
 
01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:55.910 align:start position:0%
just my opinion
um

01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
whether whether house counsel says
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's an official violation of 91a or
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
not i don't know
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing to go back to the
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
different sort of ad hoc committee that
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
the chair just proposed
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
is that committee is one that has a very
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
diverse bunch of people who are
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
interested in it
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
and requiring public notice for that
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
ensures that anybody who has an interest
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
understands that the meeting is
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
happening and gets to come and at a
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
minimum listen if not
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
participate so
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's two different things that's what
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to find out how what's
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
the correct way to do an ad hoc
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
committee that does not have
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
all the legalities that are so you have
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
generally speaking in half less than
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
half of the committee less than a quorum
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee can get together and do
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
anything they please without having to
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
report anything to anybody committee
 
01:09:56.719 --> 01:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
report anything to anybody committee
researcher

01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
just whispered in my ear it would be a
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
violation to go over half of the members
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
you shall not email the committee to
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
discuss this how do we find out who's
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
interested in working i'm interested in
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
working because whoever is pulling the
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
ad hoc committee together will be the
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper i will more than glad to
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
invite you thank you we're moving on uh
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
yeah you just i think one thing is the
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
whole difference i mean first of all you
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
didn't appoint this ad hoc committee
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
this is something that gary came forward
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
sorry merchant said came forward and
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
said i've gotten together some people
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is the same thing as we did with
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
the vaccine bill because we didn't need
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
an official committee it was just simply
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
i kept working behind the scenes with
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
gary and others until it became clear
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
they were irreconcilable differences and
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
the bill needed to die
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
but it's it was you know that's where a
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor or other people start to work
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
together and we all should do that when
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
we're generating bills anyway is work
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders and that's what
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
merchant is going to try to do but it's
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
not something that we're doing as our
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
committee he's taking it on because he's
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
a good dubi
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
so if you're interested give your name
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
to representative merchant
 
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.709 align:start position:0%
to representative merchant
and

01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
he will make sure that we do not have
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
more than half of this committee as part
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
of that group its limit is 10
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
10 people maximum
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
all right that one's done and now house
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill 602 relative to reimbursements for
 
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.390 align:start position:0%
bill 602 relative to reimbursements for
telemedicine

01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
and uh you've got the
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
you've got the should have the bill
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
before you and um
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing representative edwards
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
osborne or hunt representative woods
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
wrote the committee report when this
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
sale through 21 to zip would you like to
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
speak first
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
um yes i think in this particular
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
situation with the
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh commission still in place
 
01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.830 align:start position:0%
uh commission still in place
um

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.270 align:start position:0%
i think
we

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
this committee recommending legislation
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
would preclude the activity of that
 
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.030 align:start position:0%
would preclude the activity of that
commission

01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
so and the the answer uh indirect answer
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
would be yes i think legislation does
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
need to go forward
 
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.149 align:start position:0%
need to go forward
but

01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
i think the caveat should be that in
 
01:12:12.239 --> 01:12:13.110 align:start position:0%
i think the caveat should be that in
fact

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
that should be at the discretion of the
 
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.669 align:start position:0%
that should be at the discretion of the
commit

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
commit
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the commission
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
so i vote for it but i vote against it
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
i mean they're thinking
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
as written
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
you vote against 602 as written
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
but you want to work on it well i hands
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
please before speaking the answer the
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
answer to that is yes i think
 
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.229 align:start position:0%
answer to that is yes i think
telemedicine

01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh is like the reference uh to my
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather being a horseback
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
doctor and we've changed
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think uh telemedicine was clearly on
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
its way telemedicine with the covid
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
situation was
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
brought for and it was very clear we're
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
not going back
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
the question is how exactly are we going
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
to do that we need to do it properly and
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
i think the commission
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
um and i'm no longer on that
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative connerk is uh and i think
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
we should hear
 
01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.550 align:start position:0%
we should hear
uh

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
what they have to say and their
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh rather than just a um
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
categorical yes
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
i mean i wouldn't have any trouble
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
saying yes we need more legislation uh
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
but it has to be understood we want the
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that we know the
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
commission is in place
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro yes thank you mr
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
looking back at this legislation two
 
01:13:37.199 --> 01:13:38.550 align:start position:0%
looking back at this legislation two
specific

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
um changes that this legislation would
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
cause are
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
um doing away with audio only
 
01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.189 align:start position:0%
um doing away with audio only
telemedicine

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
and also um
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
doing away with
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
the mandates for parity in payment
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm i'm not sure
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i i have a feeling about whether
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
those should happen or not but i would
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
agree with representative woods that
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
that should um
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
we should have more information and
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations from this commission
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
before we
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
alter the legislation that's in place
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
regarding telemedicine representative
 
01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.110 align:start position:0%
regarding telemedicine representative
weber

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
weber
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
while i agree with the two previous
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
speakers that yes we are going to be
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh legislation within the vast realm of
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
telemedicine going forward
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
i think in this case we should look at
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
this very specific bill which has very
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
specific recommendations which i think
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
are very very harmful
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
and i would rock i would not vote for a
 
01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.669 align:start position:0%
and i would rock i would not vote for a
um

01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
further recommendation further
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
legislation recommendation on this bill
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
i think the specific content of this
 
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.030 align:start position:0%
i think the specific content of this
bill

01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.070 align:start position:0%
bill
is

01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
not appropriate i do agree with the
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion that this be left to the
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
commission and if the commission has
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations they can
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
do that and i have no objection to that
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
appearing in a report but i want to make
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
it clear that my vote is against further
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
legislation of this specific sort
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
since the blurb which i'm not going to
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
ask you to write on this uh we'll give
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
some guidance and suggestions would you
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
care to enumerate some of the harmful
 
01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.510 align:start position:0%
care to enumerate some of the harmful
recommendations

01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
i believe that representative shapiro
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
just gave them
 
01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.709 align:start position:0%
just gave them
the

01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
elimination entirely of telephonic
 
01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.590 align:start position:0%
elimination entirely of telephonic
communications

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
communications
 
01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.310 align:start position:0%
communications
is

01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
harmful i'm thinking of
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
waking up one morning with an attached
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
tick and calling cheshire medical
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
emergency care whatever it is the
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
walking care and saying got a tick need
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
doxycycline and they said fine we'll
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
call it into your pharmacy that took us
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
two minutes and i didn't have to drive
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
to keene
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
nor did i have to get my telephone and
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
try and figure out how to focus it on
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
where the tick wasn't anymore
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
it is a very effective modality for some
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
people for some purposes
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
and barring it seems to me to be very
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
harmful and
 
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
the issue of parity is the other issue
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
that i think is
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
would be very
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
harmful as well so those are my concerns
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
i had a long tenure at the local
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
community mental health center monadnock
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
family services and now i'm on the board
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
and they report that um
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
audio only telemedicine was really um a
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
lifesaver for them during covet because
 
01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.550 align:start position:0%
lifesaver for them during covet because
um

01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
many of their clients are poor um unable
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
to keep um and use technology
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
in a way that
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
allowed for audio visual
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
to keep in touch with people to do case
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
management over the telephone was
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
essential and incredibly helpful to them
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they could actually
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
was helpful to their bottom line and
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
helpful to them staying
 
01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.189 align:start position:0%
helpful to them staying
alive

01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
alive
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
the ceo of some small facility in
 
01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.270 align:start position:0%
the ceo of some small facility in
kingston

01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
kingston
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
i would agree with both those points
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we faced representative
 
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.750 align:start position:0%
that's what we faced representative
knurk

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
knurk
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i i agree completely with what rep
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
webber said and i think the difficulty
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
as rep shapiro just pointed out is
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
it by taking away audio only it
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
disenfranchises a significant number of
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
people who do not have internet access
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
do not have skills to use it or do not
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
have the appropriate equipment to be
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
able to do audio only so that's a
 
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.189 align:start position:0%
able to do audio only so that's a
concern

01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
the lack of parity now the issue is that
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
the 1135 waiver which is what kind of
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
allowed us to be able to do these things
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
during covet is still in effect until
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
the end of 2023 because they need to
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
gather up some more data to figure out
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
where things are going there's actually
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
a build before congress to also look at
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
the question of making permanent
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
the parity
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
and the audio only
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
and cms is apparently considering even
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
just doing it for some cpt codes for
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
example in behavioral health where it's
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
proven itself to be very
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
very good and the telehealth commission
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
is still working so i would agree so
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
much with brett weber this particular
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill should just not go any further
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
should not even be considered should be
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
considered itl
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
any other recommendations should be
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
coming from our commission that has been
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
working hard at this for a very long
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
time and not us trying to do an end run
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
around them which is really what this
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
did it was an end run to take away
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
some very good things that should stay
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
until we decide what to do thank you
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative leon
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i do see this as
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
these two different issues i believe
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
that telephone only telemedicine is a
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
very important offering and it's
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't fill every need
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
but it is important but there are also
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
other telemedicines that don't really
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
step up to that same level as of a visit
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
so the idea of parity for all telehealth
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think could be very stifling on access
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
to some of the opportunities that i had
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
explored in the medical device space in
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
order to better keep tabs on what was
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
happening to patients if you're looking
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
at remote reading of a cardiac monitor
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're looking at some of these other
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
things when you're able to have some
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
access to see what is going on with the
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
patient it does not re meet the same
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
standard as a visit but it's very
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
important to that ongoing maintenance of
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
patient health and keeping them from
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
deteriorating and getting to a more
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
expensive and more importantly
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
deleterious to their health circumstance
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
because we want to make sure that these
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
patients with
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
with um especially with with these
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
devices that can transmit with these
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
other ones being able to check in on
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
somebody and make sure that they're not
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
starting to decline is crucial and if we
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
require parity then we're going to see
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
more gatekeeping on this and i think
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of services that
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
whether you're in person or you're doing
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
telemedicine some of them should have
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
parity absolutely but not every single
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
situation so i think the idea of
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
exploring parity has a lot of value we
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
need to be able to look at
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
which are less than telehealth instances
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
and which ones are those full service
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
telehealth visits that do deserve to be
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
paid on par
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
so i think that it's a very important
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
issue it is one that should be discussed
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think that is it is something that
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
should see further legislation but
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps deferring to the group that's
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
already been formed on telemedicine
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate but i don't want to
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
slam the door on the idea of parity
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
because i believe that enabling these
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know micro visits is very supportive
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
of health
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
representative woods ah thank you mr
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh clarification for me
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
i i guess i need to understand what a
 
01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.310 align:start position:0%
i i guess i need to understand what a
vote

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
no further legislation
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh does that mean
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're debating the merits of the
 
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.350 align:start position:0%
we're we're debating the merits of the
bill

01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i as my understanding was we're not
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
debating the merits of the bill per se
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
but my mind was
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
does this area need further legislation
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
and and and that i may be operating
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
the incorrect uh premise we have an
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.679 --> 01:21:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
so here's
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
this is so different from anything else
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
and we're all policy wonks all of us
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
so it's very difficult for us to get
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
down to this level all we're saying is
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation or
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
not recommended for further legislation
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
whichever way we vote on any of these
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
bills it will have
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely no further effect whatsoever
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
on what happens next year because we
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
cannot bind the next legislature and we
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
can say this is
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
not this bill but
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
the bill under consideration is the
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
silliest thing we've ever heard of and
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
we don't think anybody should waste our
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
time with it and we can write that in a
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
report but that the next legislature has
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
the right to file that bill
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
and everybody has any right to study
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
anything they want and bring in a bill
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
on anything they want
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
so i think that the important thing here
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
whether we vote yes or whether we vote
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
no and i agree that representative leon
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
has made some very valid points
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
is that you can write
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
a report that says
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
there are some areas for further study
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
but i think that in this case we already
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
have a vehicle for that further study
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
in the commission that's doing the work
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
we ought to wait for their report and in
 
01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.390 align:start position:0%
we ought to wait for their report and in
in

01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
if you say that you can say that on a
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes vote or you can say that on a no
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
vote it's
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to make any
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
difference in the long run as to what
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
gets filed
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
i believe the critical piece here is
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
what's being delivered not how it's
 
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.870 align:start position:0%
what's being delivered not how it's
delivered

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore if we agree or back to the
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
same thing is that
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
with representative leon there should be
 
01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.470 align:start position:0%
with representative leon there should be
parity

01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
parity
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
about what the service is not how the
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
service was provided
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that's probably where it had
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
the focus of this group or somebody
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
looking at it and saying is that we have
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
to have parity
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of how it's delivered
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
but whatever is delivered should be
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
equal in
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that's kind of my comments
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative merchant um i think that
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense though one wrinkle
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
in that is some of these services can
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
only be provided by telehealth where
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
where that's where the question of if
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
you throw out that word parody but i
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
agree i agree with your sentiment that's
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
just my little concern in that statement
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
if we said something like at the end of
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
given everything we've said
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
about parity
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
because we agree that reimbursements for
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
telemedicine is a subject worthy of
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
further consideration we vote that it's
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
we recommend for further legislation you
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
know notwithstanding all the other
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
things we've said along the way
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
we think this subject is worthy of
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
further legislation is that the gist of
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
well what i was trying to say on on the
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
actual bill i mean that's a perfectly
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
valid way to go um i still think that i
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
would prefer a no vote on the actual
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill but the points you're making are
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
all very valid and
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
sorting them into a yes or a no
 
01:25:11.199 --> 01:25:12.310 align:start position:0%
sorting them into a yes or a no
is

01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
difficult because
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's just amorphous it's not a
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
yes or no decision my follow-up could be
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
also rendered
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
because we agree there are numbers of
 
01:25:22.639 --> 01:25:24.830 align:start position:0%
because we agree there are numbers of
items

01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we would wish to see differently
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
we would not recommend
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
for further legislation i mean we could
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative knurk and you could
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
even say
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
for further legislation uh under their
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
purview of the telehealth telemedicine
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's not the motion we can say that's
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
the preface
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
no and you're in your blurb in your
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
blurb because then you're just not just
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
saying we think more should be done but
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
we're saying
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
we identified that we do have this group
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's already been working for a couple
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
of years
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
let them do their work and don't try to
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
do an end run
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
regarding that parity issue i think
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
it was sb 390 that we managed just a
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
month or so ago it was avart's bill and
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's where we did have issues of
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
synchronous and asynchronous to be able
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
to cover that but the issue for parity
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do with the different
 
01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
services like i didn't get paid for the
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
same amount for doing somebody's back
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
operation as i did for a visit the issue
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
is parity that if you did a
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
mental health visit let's take that
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
because that's much more amenable in
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
person or in phone you get parity for
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
payment for that it has nothing to do
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
with different things so the
 
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.709 align:start position:0%
with different things so the
asynchronous

01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
asynchronous
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
study of uh you know reading out let's
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
say ekgs or whatever
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to be reimbursed at a whole
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
different level anyway and you're right
 
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
it cannot be done as an in-person is
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
done purely telemedicine but parity is
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
not what we're talking about in that
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
aspect it's not payment for everything
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
the same across the board it's payment
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
for equal services
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
regardless of how rendered so yes i i do
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
believe this bill
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
should not be going forward period
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
because it's the wrong bill we should
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
let the tele medicine group
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
telehealth commission i'm sorry develop
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
what they think needs to be done and
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
also let the feds continue to do the
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
work because that's where they would be
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
doing some of the work with the cpt
 
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.390 align:start position:0%
doing some of the work with the cpt
codes

01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
codes
 
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.750 align:start position:0%
codes
um

01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
too and then we can you know codify what
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
they come up with
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
as we need to
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
because the chair notices representative
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
snow's microphone light is on the chair
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative snow thank you
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
very much you notice i did have my mic
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
on i did notice a timely way
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
just to follow up in what representative
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
shapiro said
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
having a long history at one of the
 
01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers i would
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
just like to bring two things one of the
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
things the legislature required is that
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
all the community mental health centers
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
must have these crisis response teams
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
available 24 7.
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i had the opportunity to talk with a
 
01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.830 align:start position:0%
and i had the opportunity to talk with a
family

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
who the crisis response team responded
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
to in the middle of the night showed up
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
worked with the police showed up worked
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
out a very detailed safety plan
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
let the person go home so they didn't
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to go to the emergency room the
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
family was very impressed
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
that the person that showed up that
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
night then called first thing the next
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
morning called the next afternoon
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
kept assuring them that they would be
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
seen those were very reassuring to
 
01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:14.950 align:start position:0%
seen those were very reassuring to
people

01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's been a very safe outcome that
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
particular person is now fully
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
functioning again
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
if that audio thing ever went in
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
you would not have a team that's large
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
enough to keep going back that often but
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
the initial contact was made that way
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
but the follow-up game in rural areas
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
if if you if you left that out
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
especially the rural pool without it it
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
would really be a disaster and the last
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
thing is the other thing we often
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
experience is when we see somebody at
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
intake or
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
initial assessment they do show up they
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
drive a long distance they see you
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
once the plan starts to come into effect
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden there are lots of
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
reasons why nobody wants to drive
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
that distance again and at least if you
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
telephone you can check and get pretty
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
detailed information about how things
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
are going and what they're doing
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is that a lot of
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
people have said that they find it very
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
discomforting to walk into a place
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's known as a mental health center
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
where there's other people around who
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
are mentally ill and they may you know
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
just because you have it doesn't mean
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
the stigma doesn't apply to you as well
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
and it's so much more comfortable being
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
able to do it at more of a distance even
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
though there's a pretty personal contact
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i think these are all things we have
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
to think about as
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
we go ahead
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'd like to draw
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
this to a close if anybody has something
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been said
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
i like to do a straw
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
poll so we can make the
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
a positive motion here
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
if the motion were to given all the
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
boiler boilerplate that leads up to this
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
which will be the same either way
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
how many of you would be in favor of
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
saying recommended for further
 
01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:03.830 align:start position:0%
saying recommended for further
legislation

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
not recommended for further so let's try
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
it again now you know recommended for
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
okay not recommended for oh wow okay
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
somebody make a not recommended because
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the majority
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
who would like to make a not recommended
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
for further study
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'll make the motion if i can trade you
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
i would move not recommended for further
 
01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:41.990 align:start position:0%
i would move not recommended for further
legislation

01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
it was not seconded so i may have a
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes and and and i'm going to express the
 
01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.149 align:start position:0%
yes and and and i'm going to express the
concerns

01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
about um
 
01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:03.830 align:start position:0%
about um
uh

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
audio only calls because that was a
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
universal and i'm going to say that
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
agreed that further
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
clarification needs to be made
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to the reimbursement and
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
charges as to whether
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
the services are being
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
are the same services in both cases or
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
whether the services are
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
different and therefore subject to a
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
different pay scale
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
if if that if that's acceptable that's
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
the way i would write the bill
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
the motion has been made but not
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
seconded do i have a second from this
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%

01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh to clarify a previous aside um you're
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
not the only one who is trained to be
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
the clerk you know so should you come
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
back it would not necessarily have to be
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
your job
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
wow you're really trying
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'll take back peddling for 100 alex
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
and may i apologize to the committee for
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
not having turned my phone off i'm very
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
sorry oh i thought that was my phone
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay you get you get uh one um we all
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
get to know one each
 
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.030 align:start position:0%
get to know one each
uh

01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:19.990 align:start position:0%
uh
11

01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
11
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
12 24
 
01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.030 align:start position:0%
12 24
yes

01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh 12 24 prohibiting state and local
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
governments from adopting certain
 
01:33:28.639 --> 01:33:29.830 align:start position:0%
governments from adopting certain
mandates

01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
in response to covert 19 and prohibiting
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
employees of places of public
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
accommodation from discriminating on the
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
basis of vaccination status and there's
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
also an amendment in the packet of stuff
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
who wants to kick this one off
 
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
this past year had a lot of different
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
bills that dealt with covid and dealt
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
with what the appropriate response to
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
covid would be what the correct level of
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
decision making was
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly almost all of all of
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
these areas were covered by other bills
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
that were going through
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
the legislative process when we look at
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
section one which is about the mask
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
mandates both bodies move forward to
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
prohibit local school districts from
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
making their own mass decisions
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
something that quite frankly i think is
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
better suited to the department of
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
public health than 204 different groups
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
who are trying to determine what they've
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
been told by the department of public
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
health and try and make a convincing
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
argument to the school board i think
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's quite disappointing that that bill
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
ended and that bill was vetoed i think
 
01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.830 align:start position:0%
ended and that bill was vetoed i think
that

01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
i think that it's i think it's quite
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
quite scary to put public health
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
decisions in the hands of an appointed
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
health team in 200 different locations
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
among the state so i think that it is
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
important to try and figure out where
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
that type of decision should be made in
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
the future so i think that that first
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
section absolutely should still be a
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
focus of legislation going forward
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
then as we move into section two
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
some of this was already in law about
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
government agencies not being able to
 
01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:10.709 align:start position:0%
government agencies not being able to
discriminate

01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
01:35:10.719 --> 01:35:11.590 align:start position:0%
discriminate
but

01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
we worked very very hard on house bill
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
1210 it was trying to determine
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
what kind of decision your employer
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
could make about your personal health
 
01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
could make about your personal health
decisions

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's been complicated by the whole
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory path for the coveted vaccine
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
i had been part of a vaccine conference
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
back after sars when we were trying to
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
figure out how industry and how academia
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
and how government and how investors
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
could all respond in order to quickly
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
bring out a vaccine to deal with a
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
public health threat
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was very very
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
important to all the stakeholders that
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
were there at that conference was that
 
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
the scientific backing of any of those
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines would be strong so that people
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a question
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in the rush to get a
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine out which i am very very
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
thankful came out quickly
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
there was an immediate opportunity for
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
crossover from the treatment arm
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
so everybody who had volunteered was
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
excited about this possibility
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
and the number of people who crossed
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
over early on meant that we don't have
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
long-term data on those clinical trial
 
01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
long-term data on those clinical trial
participants

01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
participants
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
sorry uh i apologize i'm getting way too
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
way too deep in my um into my background
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
so crossover means that you were
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
randomly assigned to either get the
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine or get a placebo whatever the
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
treatment is or the control group
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
crossover is when you reach a certain
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
point and you say
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
if i didn't get the treatment i want it
 
01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:46.790 align:start position:0%
if i didn't get the treatment i want it
now

01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
this is so important to me that i want
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
this access i volunteered for it and i
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
deserve this
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
and that's something that's allowed in
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
these studies because otherwise why
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
would you allow people
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
why would you have people who want to
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
get the treatment
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer to get it early when there
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
might be large unknown risks
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
and then deny them the opportunity to
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
get that once it's available to the
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
general public
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's one of those confounding problems
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
that we have in scientific research and
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's one that i don't think will ever
 
01:37:17.679 --> 01:37:18.709 align:start position:0%
it's one that i don't think will ever
overcome

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
overcome
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
because you can't deny that medical
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
treatment that's available to others to
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
somebody because they were willing to
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
put themselves forward and benefit
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
science and benefit all of us
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that did away with a lot
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
of the long-term data that we would
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise have and so we're left with
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
low quality of evidence we have a lot of
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
information for a lot of people it's the
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
right decision
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
but we don't have long-term follow-up
 
01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.830 align:start position:0%
but we don't have long-term follow-up
data

01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
as we look at this and we move forward
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
we have another wrinkle here too
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
now the fda
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
the vaccine arm is looking at using a
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
future framework and they're looking at
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
well actually so if i can just step back
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
for a moment i had mentioned the 510k
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
for some of these devices that's pretty
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
much an easy approval it means we've
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
already shown this thing works we've
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
already shown that it's safe and so you
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
can make small iterations you can make
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
small changes and we already know that
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's okay so we'll let you continue
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
innovating without having to do a big
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
clinical trial
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
um what the
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
order yes we're getting way away from
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
what this bill says
 
01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.550 align:start position:0%
what this bill says
okay

01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
so if we're looking at whether or not an
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
employer can force somebody to be
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated with a drug that had
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
that had challenges to the clinical
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
trial we need to look to the fact that
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
the fda is also looking to approve
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
future vaccines based upon the same mrna
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
framework without additional robust
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
clinical trials
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
because of that we need to continue this
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
where you forfeit your rights to your
 
01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:00.310 align:start position:0%
where you forfeit your rights to your
employer

01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i believe that it's very very
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
important for us to continue with
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
legislation on this looking around the
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
room i'm not sure if we will have a
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
majority agreeing with me
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
however i believe that this is very
 
01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:12.390 align:start position:0%
however i believe that this is very
crucial

01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
crucial
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
and we need to continue this discussion
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
i've spoken with the attorney general
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
about the human rights issues of this as
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
well and there are various avenues i
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
know that we came in with a sledgehammer
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
before i think we can thread the needle
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
to avoid the needle for those who need
 
01:39:27.199 --> 01:39:27.990 align:start position:0%
to avoid the needle for those who need
to

01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
are you speaking
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
in this case representative to the bill
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
as presented or to the bill as amended
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
because the bill is amended which i was
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and you co-sponsored
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
limited the entire bill to just
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
government with no restrictions on
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
private entities i'm thank you for the
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
question i am looking back to the
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
original one i'm just looking at the
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
entire framework
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
at the time that we amended it we would
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
look to the fact that a lot of these
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
different areas were addressed in
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
separate legislation that did not make
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
it fully over the finish line
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
why would we need to say yes going
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
forward what's the gist is it a
 
01:40:10.159 --> 01:40:11.350 align:start position:0%
forward what's the gist is it a
study

01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
of the whole subject that you don't
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
think the individual bills adequately
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
did or what
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i believe that the bills that
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
we had counted on um did not make it
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
over the finish line so we need to
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
address the challenges that came up
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
among both masks and vaccination
 
01:40:29.119 --> 01:40:30.390 align:start position:0%
among both masks and vaccination
requirements

01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
bring in stakeholders and discuss with
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
the department to discuss with the
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general to discuss with
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
everybody that we should in order to
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
find the right right path forward i
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect this to be an official
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but i would i do believe
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
that this is something that will come
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
forward and i think it's something that
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
we should weigh in on let me follow up
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
my guess would be that a number of
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
people are already
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
thinking about if they haven't already
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
started meeting together in one of these
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
ad hoc
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of doesn't need approval ways
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be crafting
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
legislation on the subject of what do we
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
do going forward with masks and
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so you're suggesting is
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
going to be an informal study group
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
which i would agree there probably is
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
one and that's
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
what we're really saying
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you i guess my clarification is if
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
we vote no recommendation does it poison
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
the well when we come back in front of
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
this committee next year if this
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
committee says no and somebody presents
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
it is that a tally mark against it
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
no no it isn't representative leon and
 
01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:39.430 align:start position:0%
no no it isn't representative leon and
then

01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
i don't mean
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's representative leon moving along
 
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
to now representative weber
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
at this point we could probably change
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
seats and take the other role if we were
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
required to but that does sometimes
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
predictably i am going to say that
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
looking just at the provisions of the
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us which was never
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
amended because the amendments were
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
i am a fan of
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
first of all i
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
i want to do no harm and i know that
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to do no harm and
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
i know that we have different
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
ways of thinking the best way to do no
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
harm is so i acknowledge that up front
 
01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.629 align:start position:0%
harm is so i acknowledge that up front
but

01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
knowing that things in my small town of
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
walpole are very different from things
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
in the center of manchester
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
and also different from things in the
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
north country where the population is
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
far more diffused
 
01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.870 align:start position:0%
far more diffused
um

01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
i am a fan of local control in many many
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
many things
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh so i don't want to prohibit local
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
people from dealing with local problems
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a pretty broad
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
tenet of my
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
how i approach legislation
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to prohibit
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
people from using a tool that may be
 
01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.990 align:start position:0%
people from using a tool that may be
useful

01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
useful
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
in a phase of this or another
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic that we don't know about
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and with respect to businesses as far
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
as i am concerned if it is a private
 
01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
business they get to set their rules as
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
long as they are not violating
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
and people get to vote with their feet
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
as to whether they and their dollars as
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
to whether they patronize that business
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
so um i'm i'm also opposed to the
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
prohibition on
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
businesses requiring documentation and
 
01:43:46.159 --> 01:43:48.470 align:start position:0%
businesses requiring documentation and
um

01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.950 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of covet 19
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
status by state agencies employers or
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
public accommodation i think we actually
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
addressed in a couple of ways
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
so i think that one is moot
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
i certainly don't think that anybody
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
discriminated against on the one that we
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
dealt with was benefits you know
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
benefits benefit and shouldn't be
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
conditioned but i think we've dealt with
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
that one so
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be a
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
legislation but i understand that that's
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
um going to continue to be a debate
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
i would say it's more philosophical
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
i believe strongly in
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
state rights versus federal rights
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
unless there's a constitutional issue at
 
01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.790 align:start position:0%
unless there's a constitutional issue at
stake

01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
stake
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
estates have the rights to do what they
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
should do based upon their constituents
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
their voters in their state unless again
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
back to there's a constitutional issue
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
at stake
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
in saying that i think it's the same way
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
involving representative weber
 
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
be very careful how we use the stake
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
control to tell local municipalities
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
what they should and shouldn't do
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
no different than a state being told
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
what the fed by the federal government
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
what they can and cannot do
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's a hammer we should use and use very
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
very infrequently
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
and that's again it's philosophical is
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
we should be very careful here in
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
concord uh trying to make
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all across all of our
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in the state just like
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government should be very
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
careful what they do
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
with the states
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
and it comes to private enterprise
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
it really is private enterprise
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
just like we have our own personal
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
rights and so forth
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
corporations are people
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
they should be entitled to their own
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
rights that they wish
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
and how we basically constrain
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
an individual to be natural or otherwise
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
should be very carefully guarded and
 
01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.629 align:start position:0%
should be very carefully guarded and
very

01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
infrequently used unless there's some
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
real overarching reason to do it so
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
based upon the fact i
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
look at this more philosophically
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
we don't want the federal government
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
tell us what to do at the state level
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't have concord tell in
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns what they should do
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
at the town level
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
and definitely staying out of the
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
realm of private enterprise they as an
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
i think my biggest concern about this
 
01:46:28.719 --> 01:46:29.510 align:start position:0%
i think my biggest concern about this
bill

01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
was the fact that it is very specific to
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
covet 19.
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
um it does not really
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
even attempt to create protections for
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
other situations other diseases
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
there is a reason why
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine trials and and in
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
medications take it it takes a long time
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
to approve years
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
um i i think there is a general sense
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
that in the case of covid19 and the
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines in particular
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
there was um
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
to say that there was a sort of a rush
 
01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.870 align:start position:0%
to say that there was a sort of a rush
to

01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
to sort of make sure everybody took this
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
you know i think the the prohibition
 
01:47:17.119 --> 01:47:18.229 align:start position:0%
you know i think the the prohibition
against

01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:47:18.239 --> 01:47:19.270 align:start position:0%
against
against

01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
mass mandates at the
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
local level is something that
 
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.629 align:start position:0%
local level is something that
was

01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
deemed worthy enough to to pass both
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
has been vetoed
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
we have yet to see whether that will be
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
overridden nevertheless
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
i think the the fact that that passed uh
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
speaks to the fact that there are some
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
parts of this bill that are
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
are worth considering
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
to the question of passports and
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
businesses i would say that you know the
 
01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:52.639 align:start position:0%
question was does it violate
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights we do have a
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to privacy
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
adopted in 2018
 
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
that does focus on
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
government intrusion specifically um
 
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
but you know we we have a long history
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
of uh protecting places of public
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
accommodation in this country and i
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
think it's worth
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
considering that as we
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
as we discussed this matter going
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
forward i guess the bottom line is that
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
the the coveted pandemic
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
has really raised a lot of questions
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
that we haven't had to face before or at
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
least not in my memory
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that it is well worth
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
exploring those topics
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
and coming to some resolution on
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
where the boundaries are
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and for that reason
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
while this legislation was not the right
 
01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.590 align:start position:0%
while this legislation was not the right
legislation

01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
we we very much need to continue that
 
01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.189 align:start position:0%
we we very much need to continue that
conversation

01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
and um and and find that
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
sweet spot that is that is agreeable
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
that balances individual rights with the
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
i studied a little bit about the last
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic because you know my degrees are
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
in history as well and
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
discovered that philadelphia took a
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
radically different mandate
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
to new york with radically different
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
results and it's been a hundred years
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
since the whole issue of how do we deal
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic of this nature and
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
however we
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
vote on this bill we've got to study
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
that whole issue going forward
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
how do we respond what is that sweet
 
01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:36.830 align:start position:0%
how do we respond what is that sweet
spot

01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
spot
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:44.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
uh

01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
just three points
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
um point number one
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh within the 400 member house
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
i would say one and a half percent of
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
the membership has some expertise
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
in the data and the epidemiology of
 
01:50:03.599 --> 01:50:04.950 align:start position:0%
in the data and the epidemiology of
disease

01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
disease
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
however the remaining
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
98.5 percent take issue and have
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
considered opinions
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
which they are very willing to share
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
data notwithstanding
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
second point
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
in health and human services oversight
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
committee the commissioner of health and
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
human services lauri shibanet has
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
appeared before that oversight committee
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
and has said
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
quite directly our data on which we are
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
basing policy is simply
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
inaccurate we just don't know
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
what's accurate and what's not accurate
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
we are making decisions based on no data
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
given this
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
we have legislation before us directed
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
at covid
 
01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.510 align:start position:0%
at covid
however

01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
as my esteemed colleague representative
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
cofolt has pointed out
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
we have coming down the pike
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
numbers of new diseases and
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
i i would point out that not only do we
 
01:51:09.870 --> 01:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
have covid uh
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
3ba 2.1.2
 
01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
among us at the moment
 
01:51:15.599 --> 01:51:16.709 align:start position:0%
among us at the moment
however

01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
covid 4 and 5 have already been
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
identified and are headed our way
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
those of you who are younger than age 50
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
probably ought to think about monkey pox
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
if you are going to go to a gathering in
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
a crowded area and rub shoulders with
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
the hoi polloi and you were not
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated against smallpox
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
you may be at risk there were only 780
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
cases as of this morning internationally
 
01:51:50.669 --> 01:51:50.679 align:start position:0%
but it's probably headed our way
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
h1n5 the newest version of um
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
avian influenza is as you know rampant
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
among your chickens you may find that
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
your chicken tacos have gone up in price
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
because we've had to call the herds and
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
we're beginning to see the first few
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
human cases that may be coming our way
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
nipa virus is on the way
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
my friends
 
01:52:16.719 --> 01:52:17.589 align:start position:0%
my friends
no

01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
good expertise in the house
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
we have no good data in our department
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
of health and human services we have
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
threats coming our way are we going to
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
rewrite legislation for every threat i
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
would submit my dear colleagues that
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is probably not a game in which we
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
should be playing i
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
would like to support representative
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
weber's position and say we shouldn't be
 
01:52:44.639 --> 01:52:48.470 align:start position:0%
weber's position and say we shouldn't be
here

01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just would like to
 
01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
add a further comment that was made
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
relative to federal to state
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
and associated responsibility and then
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
state to local
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
i think there is a difference it's not
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
just a categorical
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
local control period
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
local control for
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
residential virtual commercial zoning
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
educational parameters
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
are all fine locally
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if you have covid
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
you don't stay
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
in one town
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
you travel across the state you affect
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
the entire state
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh so in that sense i think the
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
parameters of which we have to view this
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
in those circumstances are far different
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
this is a public health issue and
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
affects the entire state and to leave it
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
to local control
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's like turning loose um
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
typhoid mary
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's local control
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh if you let typhoid mary she we know
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
directly killed 58 people
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
so i think we have to be a little bit
 
01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:57.990 align:start position:0%
so i think we have to be a little bit
careful

01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
careful
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
of extending that analogy
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
to the public health domain
 
01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:06.550 align:start position:0%
to the public health domain
carefully

01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
um while i respect um the previous
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
speaker greatly i just want to um
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to give an example of how
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
local control worked with this in in my
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
keene which was hit very hard with covet
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
at one point and the hospital was filled
 
01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:33.669 align:start position:0%
at one point and the hospital was filled
and

01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
things were very difficult
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
the ceo of the hospital came forward and
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
was very outspoken in terms of the need
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
to do something about
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
reducing the risk reducing the spread of
 
01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:48.149 align:start position:0%
reducing the risk reducing the spread of
covid

01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
covid
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
he was outspoken and the city council to
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
on on his um request the city council
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
took up the possibility of a mask
 
01:54:58.400 --> 01:54:59.510 align:start position:0%
took up the possibility of a mask
mandate

01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
and there were multiple meetings um
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
with people speaking in favor of a mask
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
mandate people speaking many many people
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
came and spoke against a city-wide mask
 
01:55:11.119 --> 01:55:13.189 align:start position:0%
came and spoke against a city-wide mask
mandate

01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
while people didn't agree with each
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
other for the most part it was civil
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
there was a real dialogue there was some
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
disagreement about the city council
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
within the city council the city council
 
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.750 align:start position:0%
within the city council the city council
eventually

01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
um did create a mask mandate
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of businesses in town and
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
institutions in town um the same process
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
the mandate was then um done away with
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
when the spread had been reduced
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
then when the spread increased again it
 
01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
the mask mandate was put in place again
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
but then it was also ended
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
against the wishes of some of the public
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
health speakers
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that it was uh for me it was
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
an incredible um
 
01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:08.390 align:start position:0%
an incredible um
example

01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
not not so much of local control but of
 
01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:13.109 align:start position:0%
not not so much of local control but of
um

01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
kind of civilian
 
01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
civil civilian engagement in people
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking responsibility for their own
 
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.109 align:start position:0%
taking responsibility for their own
community

01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
and some people clearly didn't like the
 
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
the answer when mass mandate was put in
 
01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:27.350 align:start position:0%
the answer when mass mandate was put in
place

01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
some people were very disappointed when
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
the mask mandate ended
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
but i think there's great value in
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
engaging the community in
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
conversation about their own public
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
health that would be done away with with
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
this bill i also want to just comment
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
about the fact that
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and many other bills that have
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
come before us
 
01:56:50.719 --> 01:56:51.830 align:start position:0%
come before us
have

01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
used the framework of discrimination
 
01:56:56.239 --> 01:56:59.030 align:start position:0%
used the framework of discrimination
um

01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
i think we've gone
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
i i know this i know people disagree
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
with me and i know people's positions
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
are pretty hardened
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
for me it's a sad thing that we're
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
always talking about personal liberty
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
and discrimination in regard to these
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
things and we're not balancing it with
 
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
talk about public health and the
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
well-being of communities
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't really speak to the
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
specific things that the bill does but
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
for me that's a big problem and um
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to vote against um
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
recommending further legislation
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
and it went from over here did you but
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
yeah representative gay had her home
 
01:57:44.159 --> 01:57:45.430 align:start position:0%
yeah representative gay had her home
done

01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
betty will do fine
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
um i think the uh elephant in the room
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
is that we're talking about mandates
 
01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:52.790 align:start position:0%
is that we're talking about mandates
here

01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
um and so we all have very strong
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
feelings about what you should tell
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
people and how do you balance personal
 
01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
liberty with safety for everybody
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
the part that i suffered the most from
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
anguish not physically
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
we support so much information was
 
01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:17.189 align:start position:0%
we support so much information was
suppressed

01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
suppressed
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
we're finding out all kind of things now
 
01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:22.310 align:start position:0%
we're finding out all kind of things now
like

01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
the num
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
numbers were conflated people were dying
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
people uh in hospitals were counted as
 
01:58:30.239 --> 01:58:31.830 align:start position:0%
people uh in hospitals were counted as
having

01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
being there because of covid even when
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
we found out some of them tested
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
positive but that's not why they were in
 
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.790 align:start position:0%
positive but that's not why they were in
hospital

01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
medication

01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
medication
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
first was prohibited
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
then certain medication was mandated
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
there was just so much lack of solid
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
good information
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's my biggest concern i don't know
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
how to make
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
change a law to make everybody happy
 
01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:02.229 align:start position:0%
change a law to make everybody happy
but

01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
my personal feeling is let everybody
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
take care of themselves the way they
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make everybody happy when i
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
want to go around without a mask and
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
other people are afraid i'm
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
spreading viruses
 
01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:21.430 align:start position:0%
spreading viruses
but

01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know any other way to encourage
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
information to be current
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
updated educational for everybody as
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
accessible as possible
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's just that in this past two years
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
there's been so much that was
 
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
financially motivated
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
promoted by people who benefited
 
01:59:44.639 --> 01:59:45.910 align:start position:0%
promoted by people who benefited
financially

01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then we had to just dig and dig and
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
find research so
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'm still going for
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
personal care you know when i had
 
01:59:56.639 --> 01:59:57.589 align:start position:0%
personal care you know when i had
coveted

01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
coveted
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
i waited two weeks before i was exposed
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
to anybody even though cdc is saying
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
oh five days because we think that was a
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
political decision people were getting
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
mad about two weeks but you know i i
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
just would rather
 
02:00:11.679 --> 02:00:12.550 align:start position:0%
just would rather
not

02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
be enforcing mandates i would rather
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
enforce education
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
free and open
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
current as the numbers change
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
we're drawing near to the end because
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
again we're not voting the bill
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
and there will be no question about it
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
ad hoc group or groups looking at
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
various aspects of this this is just to
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
get out there and into our report some
 
02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
feelings so a couple left representative
 
02:00:42.719 --> 02:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
feelings so a couple left representative
leon

02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
leon
 
02:00:46.070 --> 02:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman i think this
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
has been a good discussion and i do
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
think that the information that
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative snow shared about the
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
decision making without much data
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
was actually one of the biggest problems
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
with this whole experience
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
everybody was left grasping for what to
 
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.310 align:start position:0%
everybody was left grasping for what to
do

02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:03.270 align:start position:0%
do
and

02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
without strong data people came out very
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
very heavy-handed and i'm actually
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
fearful for what that's going to do in
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
the next time when we need to rely on
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
public health i think that allowing
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
non-governmental organizations and
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
others to influence the way that people
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
operate and then not allow the state to
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
have a role to say hold on let's stop
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
and take a look at what data do or don't
 
02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:26.870 align:start position:0%
and take a look at what data do or don't
exist

02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
exist
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
allowed people to overplay
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of scientific evidence that
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
we had about our specific risk
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
mitigation efforts i think that a lot of
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
this is around
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
how much information do you have in
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
order to force these these choices and i
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think the hand was quite honestly
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
overplayed and that's why there's been
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
so much pushback i i i hope we don't
 
02:01:53.669 --> 02:01:53.679 align:start position:0%
have a situation where the data is so
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
clear because of how great the harm is
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
in another future situation but i have
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
confidence that all the people who are
 
02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:02.470 align:start position:0%
confidence that all the people who are
saying

02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
i need to have the chance to make my own
 
02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
decision would look at those data and
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
say oh yes i'm staying home yes this is
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to do and just like when
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
i was wearing my respirator around which
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
i guess was
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
selfish that was still the best way to
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
protect myself and i want everybody to
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
have the best tools to protect
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
themselves so i think i know the way
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we're going on this but i do
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we need to look at the
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
right level of response based on the
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
data so that we don't harm further
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
future public health efforts
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
and representative canark
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like to take off right on what
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
the issue of the data um
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
as some of us in here have done we've
 
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
spent our whole life we're looking at
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
data and we have to understand that
 
02:02:54.070 --> 02:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
there was when you have a novel disease
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's new you're going to have a lot of
 
02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:58.070 align:start position:0%
that's new you're going to have a lot of
uncertainty

02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
uncertainty
 
02:02:58.080 --> 02:02:59.750 align:start position:0%
uncertainty
and

02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:00.550 align:start position:0%
and
i

02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's been some sort of accusations
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
here that about the data it's people
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
have to understand that sometimes the
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
reason that recommendations changed is
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
that the information changed and the the
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
public health authorities were
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
quite straightforward some you know in
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
terms of clarifying why
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
they changed it because the information
 
02:03:19.599 --> 02:03:20.709 align:start position:0%
they changed it because the information
changed

02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
changed
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
but people were interpreting that as
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't know what they were doing
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the reality of the fact
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
that we often have uncertainty in the
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
early phases of anything like this
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
now the difficulty the comments have
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
been made about future and that is
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
exactly the point that i want to make
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
we should not be addressing this
 
02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:40.950 align:start position:0%
we should not be addressing this
legislatively

02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
because you can't tie the hands of
 
02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
public health
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
public health has to remain nimble we
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
just talked a little while ago about we
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't legislate the practice of medicine
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
we also should not be legislating the
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
practice of public health and the reason
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
for that is very simple they've got to
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
be able to be nimble make changes
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
rapidly as things change on the ground
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
the legislative process is slow long and
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
cumbersome this is my great objection to
 
02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:08.390 align:start position:0%
cumbersome this is my great objection to
hb1131

02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
hb1131
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
the prohibition of mass mandates was not
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
just the local control
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
but it was generic for anything
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
it wasn't about code it was anything
 
02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
so if we did have something come through
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
that was a very highly transmissible but
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
clear data that we could clearly stop it
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
with a mask
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
you would not be able to
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
put in a mask mandate if you chose to do
 
02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:33.510 align:start position:0%
put in a mask mandate if you chose to do
so

02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the other difficulty is when you
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
keep saying it's all individual
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility we do have a
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility to one another
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
and for example when we say you can't
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
drive drunk it's your own choice whether
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
you want to drive drunk but we actually
 
02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:47.679 align:start position:0%
tell you you can't do that because
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to kill other people
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
i agree it'd be wonderful if it had
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
perfect data from the beginning the only
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
time one has perfect crystal clear
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
feelings about something for beginning
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
is when you're really dealing more with
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
ideology and religion because then it's
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
a belief
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
in the real world of science there's a
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
lot of murkiness and our public health
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
people did the best job they could
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
trying to make decisions
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
we should not be trying to legislate
 
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
what they can and cannot do
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
just like we don't legislate medicine we
 
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't legislate the practice of public
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
health because they've got to be nimble
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
we should not be legislating these
 
02:05:24.159 --> 02:05:25.109 align:start position:0%
we should not be legislating these
issues

02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
i'm going to speak thank you i'm going
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
to speak last before we put this to a
 
02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:30.149 align:start position:0%
to speak last before we put this to a
vote

02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
i think one of the things that i
 
02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:34.229 align:start position:0%
i think one of the things that i
observed

02:05:34.229 --> 02:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
observed
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
was not just
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
they were very different
 
02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:39.109 align:start position:0%
they were very different
opinions

02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
but some
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
in both sides
 
02:05:42.639 --> 02:05:43.830 align:start position:0%
in both sides
lacked

02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
lacked
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
a hint of humility
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
and because we don't know and data does
 
02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:51.030 align:start position:0%
and because we don't know and data does
change

02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
i've heard the the word science
 
02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:55.510 align:start position:0%
i've heard the the word science
weaponized

02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
weaponized
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why i asked and i'll use your
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
academic title dr woods to make that
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
presentation to us
 
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
alleged fixity of science because i
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
heard people who ought to know better
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
from all across the spectrum use the
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
latest scientific thing
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
as the fixed and final answer which did
 
02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:20.950 align:start position:0%
as the fixed and final answer which did
invite

02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
invite
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
some blowback which wanted to kill all
 
02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.390 align:start position:0%
some blowback which wanted to kill all
science

02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
science
 
02:06:26.550 --> 02:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm sitting there saying
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
folks this is
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's the wrong way to do a debate
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
whatever your ultimate conclusion is
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
but we still have to respond
 
02:06:37.709 --> 02:06:37.719 align:start position:0%
and as chairman of
 
02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
dhhs oversight
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
i've had several discussions with the
 
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.669 align:start position:0%
i've had several discussions with the
commissioner

02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
how can we have a rapid response of us
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
because getting a bill through and
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
having it voted on two houses and
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor a lot of arguably
 
02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
good legislation once it's signed has
 
02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
long since become irrelevant
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
so where is the rapid response team that
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
gives input other than
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
one of my housekeeping items eventually
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
led to
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
a wonderful i think
 
02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:15.830 align:start position:0%
a wonderful i think
ethics

02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that the thank you
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner cheered on
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't tell them what to do it does
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
tell them what certain people think and
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
we can get that group together
 
02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.990 align:start position:0%
we can get that group together
lickety-split

02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
lickety-split
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm hopeful as we go forward we don't
 
02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
trash science but we understand what
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
science is and isn't
 
02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
and we keep humility that what we said
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
in our medical center is these are the
 
02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
rules we're putting in place as best we
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
understand it now please work with us
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
and we didn't shame people who didn't
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
like what we did and we didn't
 
02:07:56.550 --> 02:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
give you know merit badges to those
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
people who are hyper compliant we just
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
said we're all struggling along in this
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
thing that affects us all folks and we
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
want your input but
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
a decision needs to be made
 
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
that would be my encouragement
 
02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:13.350 align:start position:0%
that would be my encouragement
to

02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
whatever emerges out of whatever ad hoc
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
groups happen
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
i'd like to do another straw before we
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
get in motion so we get a motion that
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
will pass
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
the motions possibly are we recommend
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
for legislation
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
not this bill but we recommend this
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
topic for legislation or we do not
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation on this topic okay
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
so who would say we do recommend
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay i'm seeing about four and who would
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
say we do not
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm going to ask then so that
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
the motion can be a positive motion
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
because if it fails we just got to do it
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
around anyway uh who would make the
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
motion uh that we do not recommend
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
prefer the legislation
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
and we'll get a medical doctor in there
 
02:09:07.199 --> 02:09:07.990 align:start position:0%
and we'll get a medical doctor in there
dr

02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
dr
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh and who would uh second that if we
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
can have someone from the republican
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
side would be very helpful i didn't see
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
all the republican hands
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
go up and um would how about
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative mcmahon how are you
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
so would you second this
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
that way it's bipartisan
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
all right the recommendation the motion
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
before us as the um house bill 1244 we

12 to four
the

02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation is we do not recommend
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
further legislation on this
 
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
which again as we know is a moot point
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
because the ad hoc groups are going to
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
get and study this this summer and the
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
all right 12
 
02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:29.030 align:start position:0%
all right 12
24

02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.239 --> 02:11:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
and yes representative can i i'd just
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
like to make a
 
02:11:48.159 --> 02:11:49.589 align:start position:0%
like to make a
comment

02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
if i could uh just sir
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
i think in the consideration of how
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
data is handled and the public
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
perspective with information
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
or disinformation
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things you have to ask in the
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
scientific vein
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
is what would happen
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
we had some trials
 
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
of a vaccine
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
or a trial of any treatment for that
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
matter that looked quite good
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
and it was a serious
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
public threat
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
and yet it quote didn't meet the
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
standard and we waited and we waited and
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
we waited
 
02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:30.550 align:start position:0%
we waited
until

02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
we would be asking the public would now
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
be asking
 
02:12:40.159 --> 02:12:41.430 align:start position:0%
be asking
wait

02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
wait
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
we had the preliminary data
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
and we didn't go forward
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
and look what we got
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
and those are the decisions we have to
 
02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:53.990 align:start position:0%
and those are the decisions we have to
make

02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i think we have to ask ourselves
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
that question
 
02:12:59.189 --> 02:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
in each of the pandemics that we're
 
02:13:01.990 --> 02:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
going to face
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
know when i chose to get the vaccines
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'd seen data
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i had to i made my decision on the
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
basis of
 
02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:11.109 align:start position:0%
basis of
risk

02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
what's the odds
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
what's the odds of me not
 
02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
what would happen what's the odds of me
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
getting the vaccine what negative might
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
happen and i had for myself had a way
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't clear
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
i mean a lot of
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
vaccines now whether you like vaccines
 
02:13:29.709 --> 02:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
or not we know the number is
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
infinitesimally small we did not know
 
02:13:31.679 --> 02:13:32.470 align:start position:0%
infinitesimally small we did not know
that

02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
in my opinion here
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
so yeah what are the risks what are the
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
risk of not doing anything what are the
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
risks of doing something because we got
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
to do every anything and what are the
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
risks of doing it too quickly yeah
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's the discussion yes representative
 
02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:46.709 align:start position:0%
that's the discussion yes representative
weber

02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
weber
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
hi mr chairman time is creeping on and
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
we still have two bills to do and one
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
will take one minute but thank you for
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
that um uh who would like to write the
 
02:14:05.109 --> 02:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and going backwards on 642 in
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
telemedicine nobody got assigned writing
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
the blurb on that who would
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
do that and you in your turn said you
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
would write the blurb on articular
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
therapy yeah that was the deal we had
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 1271 limiting the authority
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
of dhhs to mandate vactin vaccinations
 
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
and relative to quarantine
 
02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:54.709 align:start position:0%
and relative to quarantine
costs

02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh referred to interim study by a vote
 
02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:00.470 align:start position:0%
uh referred to interim study by a vote
of

02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh who would like to speak on 1271
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i think when you
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
get down to the core of this bill it was
 
02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
get down to the core of this bill it was
looking

02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
looking
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
not at the idea of availability but how
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
much data and how much
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
how much agreement was necessary in
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
order to require an intervention
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
in that little interim space
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative woods had a very good
 
02:15:31.030 --> 02:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
point about we don't want to hold up
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
people's access to new therapies and we
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to hold up access to things
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
that would limit the spread of disease
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm actually quite thankful that it
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
was approved when it was what we're
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
looking at here with this bill in 1271
 
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
is when it would be required i believe
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
that our department of public health has
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
done an excellent job looking at the
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
level of data we have
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
and not overstepping the data that
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
exists i spent my career on the cutting
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
edge of data because i was working with
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
companies before they even were in their
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
final trials trying to figure out if
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
something looked like it would be
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
promising to public health or individual
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
health and so i'm very comfortable
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
working in that area of projecting what
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
we may expect based upon the data that
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
are available and knowing that knowing
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
the work that the department has done
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm very pleased with the fact that
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
they're still
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
waiting to see what other data become
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
available while encouraging those who do
 
02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
want to receive the vaccine to please go
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
ahead and get it i think that that's
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
walking a beautiful balance and i'm very
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
thankful that the department is not
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
looking to make this a required vaccine
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
at this point because of the level of
 
02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:37.429 align:start position:0%
at this point because of the level of
evidence

02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
because of that you know i think that we
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
will have more discussions going forward
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure how much this specific
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
bill itself needs to be the one that
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
becomes a genesis
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
there is that question about
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
quarantining this this was actually
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
looked at the wrong section this was
 
02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
looking at quarantining of goods um
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
something that happened off the coast of
 
02:16:58.509 --> 02:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
long beach for
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
non-non-contagious reasons for far too
 
02:17:00.719 --> 02:17:01.990 align:start position:0%
non-non-contagious reasons for far too
long

02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
and and we know the economic cost to
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
holding up goods and we've also seen the
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
economic cost to holding people up in
 
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
their homes but that's something that
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
the state isn't going to be able to look
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
at what the actual cost of forcing
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
somebody to stay home is that's why we
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
need to be careful about when we force
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
people to stay home without
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
putting us all at risk and and i believe
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
that that the department's done a good
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
requiring a vaccine has a much higher
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
standard of evidence than making it
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
available and while i believe that those
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
kernels are important i do believe that
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
this one itself doesn't need to be the
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
seed of things moving forward and i
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
think i think that the idea of not
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
and i would just state that i i have
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
come to the same conclusion somewhat
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
from a different direction but
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
if representative leon would care to
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
make that motion i would be glad to
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.719 --> 02:18:05.349 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
for for all of all of the reasons we've
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
already expressed
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
so moved
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
kanark uh yes i agree and i think this
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill as it came in was a little strange
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
again the one
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
bad a bad
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
citation in statute but also the idea of
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
adding a two-thirds vote of the
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to be able to do it then we
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
had an amendment that took away
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
everything and only kept it with
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
repealing 21p 42a which made no sense i
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
mean so it's been a bit of a mishmash so
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
i agree this particular bill
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
should be put out of its misery
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
the whole issue about how we manage
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
questions of mandatory vaccinations is
 
02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:55.519 align:start position:0%
something which we have dealt with we
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
actually have the sb 288 commission
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to already be looking and
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
although that's again only about covid
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
but we also have had other places other
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
bills we've dealt with that had to do
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
with vaccinations in general so i think
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
we've also beaten that topic to death
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
then we can let this bill go so i
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
support representative leon's motion
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to call the question
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
the motion is not recommended for
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
further legislation house bill 1270 one
 
02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
moved by
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
leon and seconded by weber would the
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%

and representative pearson yes 17-0
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%

02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
well i have to write them up and submit
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
them and they go into the calendar they
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
will be published in the house calendar
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
sometime late october early november
 
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
and no further action is taken they're
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
and now last
 
02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1290 establishing a task
 
02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
force on precision medicine and
 
02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
biomarker testing you will remember
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
the late and much missed representative
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
rogers came before us
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the reason we didn't want to go
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
forward with it is that we felt a
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
the joint legislative dhhs oversight
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
committee would be the better venue for
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
this to take place and the reason we
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
sent it to independent study is to say
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
itl is a negative and we didn't wish to
 
02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
say that it was a great bill it was just
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
not the vehicle we all thought was was
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
the best way to do it so we sent it here
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
so that we could have another
 
02:21:39.359 --> 02:21:40.790 align:start position:0%
so that we could have another
opportunity

02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
to celebrate not only this bill but the
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
life and career of representative rogers
 
02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:49.030 align:start position:0%
life and career of representative rogers
um

02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:49.750 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's anything else to
 
02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:52.550 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's anything else to
say

02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
but we can say it anyway representative
 
02:21:54.399 --> 02:21:56.710 align:start position:0%
but we can say it anyway representative
weber

02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
weber
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
i would simply move not recommended for
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
further legislation on the basis that
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
the issue has is being addressed under
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
the guidance i believe of our own
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
representatives alloway
 
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
and that the committee thanks
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative rogers for
 
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
raising the issue and bringing it to our
 
02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
attention but that no further
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed because it is
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
being addressed elsewhere
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this is actually
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
another one of the areas i was involved
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
in in my previous career well over a
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
decade a decade ago i worked with a
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
company working on biomarkers to detect
 
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
for cancer
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
we just got this in the mail they're
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
presenting at the american society of
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
clinical oncology and they're still not
 
02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
yet approved i'm very thankful that the
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is working on how we
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
can bring this forward but it's not even
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
really ready for approval by the fda so
 
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's definitely not ready for
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
specific encouragement within the

and it's been a fun two years with
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
everybody we really worked hard together
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
but we didn't always agree but really
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
tried to whenever we could is it likely
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we're to come back in september or
 
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
october or anything
 
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
veto not there's a veto day but i don't
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
think because the committee has finished
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
its work i don't know what the committee
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
would come back because these will
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
the reports will go in and the bills
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
will no longer be in the possession of
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
the committee but i would just like to
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
say on a personal level
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
to extend my thanks to the chair
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
for his work of the last two years i
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
so i've had other committee chairs say
 
02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
how do you do it
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i said you got to have a committee
 
02:28:43.270 --> 02:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's how we do it representative snow
 
02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:48.230 align:start position:0%
that's how we do it representative snow
yes

02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
regrettably and
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
not that my
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
choosing i'm unable to run for
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
re-election this time
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
due to health reasons at home with my
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
wife and my personal mobility is
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat more limited than i expected
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm really unable to continue but i
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
did want to thank this group the
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
leadership of the group and the members
 
02:29:13.590 --> 02:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's an unusual committee where we have
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
different people with very different
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
points of view and yet we always
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
interact in a way that's courteous and
 
02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
respectful and i really appreciate it
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
i'll never forget it thank you
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative snow if you see a hearing
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%

02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
can come and we promise to turn your mic
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
on for you

02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
pleasurable on my part
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%

capacity
um

02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:42.950 align:start position:0%
um
it's

02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
awe-inspiring in many ways
 
02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:47.429 align:start position:0%
awe-inspiring in many ways
and

02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%

02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
chance to serve
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
i've gained so much
 
02:30:54.399 --> 02:30:55.349 align:start position:0%
i've gained so much
um

02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
over the course of years
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
i honestly felt and when i knocked doors
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
i told people
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
i've been so privileged in many ways i
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
felt i owed something back
 
02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
and i tried to do that and i appreciate
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
those who
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
would listen to my
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
physics as we went along it's still
 
02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
i realize it's a bit of a bore
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
but it it really is
 
02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:22.150 align:start position:0%
but it it really is
oh

02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:31:23.210 --> 02:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
explain your pun
 
02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:24.309 align:start position:0%
explain your pun
[Laughter]

02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:31:24.319 --> 02:31:25.510 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
oh

02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:35.190 align:start position:0%
oh
um

02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
again i just want to thank everybody and
 
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
i've i've thoroughly enjoyed it and
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
um i the sidebar i i although i'm
 
02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
retired i was able to do several hand
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
consults over the course of time and
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
that was i was
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
enjoyable as well
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh and i i honestly say that i um i've
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
always told my daughters
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh they would come and we didn't have
 
02:32:02.230 --> 02:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
any more we just had three girls and
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh i'd always expected at least one boy
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
to you know be the sports person
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh but so you had to i had to be a
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more cautious and so i uh
 
02:32:12.710 --> 02:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
when i interact
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
they would come in and
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
so i would challenge them
 
02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
and they would say well what if i i i
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
want to do such and such
 
02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:21.030 align:start position:0%
want to do such and such
um

02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
well that sounds reasonable what about
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
the other argument on the other side
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
and of course with three teenage
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
daughters in the house at once i all i
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
would get would be the roll of the eyes
 
02:32:32.479 --> 02:32:34.469 align:start position:0%
would get would be the roll of the eyes
dad

02:32:34.469 --> 02:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
dad
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
so i said you do understand
 
02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
that if you only can argue one side even
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
though you may be right but if you can
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
only argue one side by definition you're
 
02:32:43.920 --> 02:32:46.150 align:start position:0%
only argue one side by definition you're
prejudiced

02:32:46.150 --> 02:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
prejudiced
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's the definition of being
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
prejudiced so my comment being
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
until you can argue both sides
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
come back another day
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
take that personally and i must say that
 
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
i have learned
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
from everybody
 
02:33:07.510 --> 02:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's appropriate we give him a
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
and and speaking of your exhortation to
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
take the other side i'm in a
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
what is it a
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
program would you explain what i'm doing
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
in that group
 
02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
with you and representative shapiro
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%

02:33:32.469 --> 02:33:32.479 align:start position:0%

training
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
seniors to be advocates on
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
both in the community and at the
 
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
legislature for
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
issues that affect seniors and we are
 
02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:48.389 align:start position:0%
issues that affect seniors and we are
participating

02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
participating
 
02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
in their day on legislative action i get
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
to argue against
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
103 the dental bill which i took point
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
on on the floor
 
02:34:01.270 --> 02:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
with the assurance that that little
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
sound bite would not be separated from
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know my wife says don't do it it's a
 
02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:07.510 align:start position:0%
you know my wife says don't do it it's a
trap

02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
trap
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i know it won't be but anyway i get
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
to argue the negative side against you
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
it should be fun anyone else not coming
 
02:34:18.150 --> 02:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
back who wants to say a few words
 
02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:25.760 align:start position:0%

02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
heavily republican district so i'm going
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
to try
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
