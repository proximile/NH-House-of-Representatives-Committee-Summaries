district 13.
 
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.150 align:start position:0%
district 13.
i've

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
i've
 
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
been in kingston since 1970
 
00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
and the retirement system was created in
 
00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.870 align:start position:0%
and the retirement system was created in
68.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
68.
 
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
and first few years i lived in kingston
 
00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
70 50 years ago
 
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
there were probably only four or five
 
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
people in the retirement system
 
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
maybe the chief of police fire chief
 
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
throat agent
 
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
town clerk
 
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.590 align:start position:0%
town clerk
maybe

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
a librarian and of course all the
 
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 align:start position:0%
a librarian and of course all the
teachers

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently as i watched the growth
 
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
and i don't think my town was on typical
 
00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
now the fire the fire department has
 
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
about 12 full-time employees
 
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
group two the police department has
 
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
about 12 group two the road department
 
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
always has about 10 full-time employees
 
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
so this is this is typical
 
00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
of the growth of this retirement system
 
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we don't often refer to it's grown
 
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
so much since its inception
 
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.789 align:start position:0%
so much since its inception
and

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
when i sat down to do the the budget for
 
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.789 align:start position:0%
when i sat down to do the the budget for
um

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
12 and 13
 
00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at this huge growth that i
 
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
had experienced to to date then
 
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.469 align:start position:0%
had experienced to to date then
and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
we couldn't even project it we were
 
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
working on a very tight budget
 
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
the democrats had overestimated the
 
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
revenue in the previous biennium and
 
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 align:start position:0%
then in this
 
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
first year of it they realized their
 
00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 align:start position:0%
error and were trying to cut 200 million
 
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
out of it and one of the things they did
 
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
was reduce the
 
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
state's contribution to non-state
 
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
employees from 35 percent to 25 percent
 
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
i thought whoa we're going to see a lot
 
00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 align:start position:0%
of pushback about this not a whimper
 
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
because the democrats did it
 
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.070 align:start position:0%
because the democrats did it
and

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
i wasn't empowered to do it then
 
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
so okay what are we gonna do
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
this looks like it's it's continuing to
 
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
grow i've got a budget so tight had to
 
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
cut it ten percent was the orders we all
 
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.869 align:start position:0%
cut it ten percent was the orders we all
followed

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
followed
 
00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:55.910 align:start position:0%
followed
okay

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
if this
 
00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
growth of this retirement systems keeps
 
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
going how can i predict how much to put
 
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 align:start position:0%
in this line for the 35 the 25 percent
 
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 align:start position:0%
at the time and uh
 
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
if if a town decides you know
 
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
everybody deserves a six percent pay
 
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
raise that's six percent more we have to
 
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
contribute if everybody decides we're
 
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
going to add 12 new employees that's 12
 
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
more employees we have to contribute to
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
those were things i could not control we
 
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
sat here in these divisions asking very
 
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
tough questions for all the people that
 
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
come before us to try to project where
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
are we going to be in 27 months
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
how much more are you going to spend how
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
much more increase do you see in this
 
00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
this line on that line and we try to get
 
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
it very tight
 
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
because we have some very tight
 
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.070 align:start position:0%
because we have some very tight
sometimes

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.350 align:start position:0%
sometimes
projections

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
projections
 
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.390 align:start position:0%
projections
so

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
what i did to change the 25 to zero was
 
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
caused all the employees to contribute
 
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.470 align:start position:0%
caused all the employees to contribute
more

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 align:start position:0%
they added two percent to the group one
 
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
people who were contributing five
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
percent of the time mostly teachers and
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
then to the
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
uh police i think we added two and a
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
quarter and to the firemen two and three
 
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
quarters so everybody's contribution
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
went up i had a few people got in my
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
face this is a new tax you're screwing
 
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
me you're stealing my money i want it
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
back i said you will get it back when
 
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
you retire this is enforce pay and force
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
savings no one else can touch this money
 
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
this is your money i'm just forcing you
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
to put more of it in
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
up front
 
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.990 align:start position:0%
up front
so

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
yes to seven percent but you were doing
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
the 20-year retirement you're up in 11
 
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.350 align:start position:0%
the 20-year retirement you're up in 11
plus

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
plus
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
but you've got a 20-year retirement so
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
and and you usually retire at higher pay
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
than the teachers or the group one
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
so this is going to help fund that
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
now about that same time we had to and
 
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.230 align:start position:0%
now about that same time we had to and
panel

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
panel
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
a group because we were billions of
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
dollars underpaid because
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the 90s
 
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
the investments were doing fantastic
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
they were up around 10 percent
 
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
and we had assumed an eight and a half
 
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.310 align:start position:0%
and we had assumed an eight and a half
percent

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so everything above eight and a half
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
percent they skimmed put in a special
 
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
fund i didn't think that was a good idea
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
having been in the stock market for a
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
while you know it goes up and it goes
 
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
down and it goes up and it goes down and
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
when it's up you've got to keep that
 
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
money for when it goes down to try to
 
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
level it up but we weren't doing that we
 
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
were skimming it we put it all in a
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
special fund and promise it would be
 
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
special fund and promise it would be
used

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
for cost of living adjustments well most
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
retirement systems except for the
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
federal government ones
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to have cost of living
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
adjustments you have to put in more
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
money if you only put in a certain
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
amount of money then when you retire
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
it's a fixed income forever if you live
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
another 30 years you don't go up a dime
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
in the in the private one so this is
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the in the middle uh
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
obviously we all see social security uh
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
increases at a small amount every year
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
not quite as much as inflation but there
 
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
is small increases so
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
that one money was used for a few years
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the 2000s for
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
um cost of living adjustments and the
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
teachers chose to have it be a
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
contribution to the retirement or to the
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
medical insurance which was getting very
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
expensive at the time so they choose to
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
take all their money instead of giving
 
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.710 align:start position:0%
take all their money instead of giving
it

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
and the other interesting thing was when
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
we took money and put it aside for a
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustment for a
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
designated group
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
you knew exactly who was in that group
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
you knew how old they were what the
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
health history was and everything and
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
you were projecting out to end of life
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
for every member of that group and they
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
would say okay giving them two percent a
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
year increase or two percent a month
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
whatever uh increase in that budget
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
that means we've got to fund this much
 
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.150 align:start position:0%
that means we've got to fund this much
money

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
but the assumption is
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
at eight and a half percent
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're assuming that we put two million
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
aside for you your group and and
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
and at the eight percent by the end of
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
your lives you'll all be set until we
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
run out of money okay
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
during that time we were also not
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
getting eight and a half percent on
 
00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:03.749 align:start position:0%
getting eight and a half percent on
anything

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
that whole decade
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
had an average of about five percent but
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
all these
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
these estimates kept going up and up and
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
up assuming eight and a half percent
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
assuming at half percent no we're making
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
five percent the delta kept growing so
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
by the end of that time we were billions
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
of dollars short and what the actuaries
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
said should be in that fund we had a
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
real problem
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
so in 2011 and 12
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
a group of our colleagues tried to get
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
together and try to say how are we going
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
to fix this one of the things they were
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
after was okay instead of a three-year
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
getting a three-year high we'll go to a
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
five-year high a lot of systems do a
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
five-year high the one i had from
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
american airlines went to a five-year
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
your best five years and uh
 
00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:45.749 align:start position:0%
your best five years and uh
quite

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
quite
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
a few other systems do five years rather
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
than three years
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then a lot of people
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
that were able to
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
were spiking it
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
the worst case was some
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
police chief
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
his last three years he took this the
 
00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.469 align:start position:0%
his last three years he took this the
assumption

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay if anybody's on overtime i'm on
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
overtime because i've got to be
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for them
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
so he had about an 80 80 or 90 hour
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
weeks work every week for pay
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
going into his retirement system for
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
that three years
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
which didn't stay in there long enough
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
to give any appreciation but when he
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
retired he retired at a higher pay than
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
what he was earning
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
because of the spiking that of course
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
was an
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
an extreme case and doesn't happen
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
everybody but
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
occasionally when the union leader
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
publishes who gets the most in the
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
retirement pace sometimes i remember one
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
year it was just a state trooper making
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
105 thousand a year
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
how did he manage that he wasn't wasn't
 
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
how did he manage that he wasn't wasn't
a

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
captain he wasn't a lieutenant he wasn't
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
a sergeant just a trooper
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
making 105 000 a year we had to have a
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
lot of overtime so
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
a few other people managed to spike it
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
those are the things we have to worry
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
about when we're trying to design how
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
much do we contribute and it's even
 
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.750 align:start position:0%
much do we contribute and it's even
difficult

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
in the state budget for the eleven
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
thousand employees we have but most of
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
them being in group one it's very
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to spike because
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
they'll get comp time or something else
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
rather than they'll run a lot of them
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
are on salary so it doesn't affect us as
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
much but for police and fire and
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
corrections department
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
it is a common problem there's a lot of
 
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
people with a lot of overtime whether
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
they want it or not
 
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.269 align:start position:0%
they want it or not
and

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
so the idea was no more spiking and they
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
set something up that i thought at the
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
time said okay you're gonna your last
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
five years you can get no more
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
than what you got the average overtime
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
for all the rest of your career
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
so there's no sense trying to spike it
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
but state of the average you had now i'm
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
hearing that
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
somebody's interpretation whether it's
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
the union or the retirement system isn't
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
counting any of their overtime in the
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
last five years and that's wrong and i'm
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to that and i think we've got a
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill that takes care of it
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
but i think the bill we're talking about
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
that one's on monday that was on monday
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
all right but the bill we're talking
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
about i'm also opposed to it says oh
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're in property tax problems because
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
you took away our 35
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
that was back
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
decades ago or a decade ago so how come
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden it's a big deal
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
let's give a seven and a half percent
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
well that's kind of a foot in the door
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
hoping to get 35
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
and i already took care of that we're
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
already been now from since 2012
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
not contributing to non-state employees
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
retirement systems that's
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's been settled so to act like it
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
suddenly caused the um uh
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
state taxes to go up the state taxes or
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
the school taxes go up because the
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
schools 80 85 percent go into the
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
schools no one's controlling
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
the staff surge
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
typically okay we have 38 fewer students
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
this year we hired 18 people huh
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing that in some of my school
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
reports and that's not untypical so
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
i remember back in 1999 we were sued you
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
have to give more you have to help the
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
schools more you have to give them more
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
money for property tax relief okay
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
19.99 we gave 200 million more back to
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
the towns for property tax relief
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
forty percent of them had set
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
their school budgets so they couldn't
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
spend any more on schools but they gave
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
property tax relief for one year for
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
forty percent of the towns
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
the next year every cent we sent to them
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
went into
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
more money in the schools they were
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
hiring like crazy
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
and so gee that didn't work so well we
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
meant to reduce property taxes but i
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
guess it didn't work out
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
so everything that we tried since
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
claiming property tax relief always just
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
gets grabbed up and spent
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
and this pr
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
current bill
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
is 28 million dollars in the fiscal note
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't make the number up
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
28 million dollars
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
and at seven and a half percent
 
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.389 align:start position:0%
and at seven and a half percent
to

00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh to the towns from to help with the
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
contributions the retirement system
 
00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:05.350 align:start position:0%
contributions the retirement system
okay

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
28 million dollars
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
to 1.3 million people and assuming
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
one-third are taxpayers because it's
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
about three people in each
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
house that pays taxes
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
am i going to get excited about that for
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
property tax savings
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
my taxes will go up more than sixty
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
dollars and the schools will keep
 
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.110 align:start position:0%
dollars and the schools will keep
increasing

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.710 align:start position:0%
increasing
so

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
i see it as wasted money
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's not going to do what we intended to
 
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.590 align:start position:0%
it's not going to do what we intended to
do

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
we figured out something by this
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee i give credit to karen
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
umberger the way to reduce property
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
taxes was to take it off of the swept
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
everybody has it in that tax bill
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
so much for the school tax so much for
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
the swept tax statewide education
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's been
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
for probably
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
336 million dollars and at one point
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of fight over donor
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
towns and we got rid of that
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
you remember that well being from a
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
donor town so it's a lot of big deal no
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
more donor towns so everybody gets the
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
swept and gets to keep it
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
and some of them might need it
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
some of the towns don't need it but they
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
get it anyway and uh so
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
if you reduce the swept
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
then that comes right off your property
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
tax bill i estimate maybe 250 dollars
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
per taxpayer
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
is getting saved
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
and another important thing we
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
frequently overlook
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
is the people that come and vote for us
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
the people that come and talk to us
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
about the taxes and so on they only
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
represent about 50 of those paying the
 
00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:45.590 align:start position:0%
represent about 50 of those paying the
taxes

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
33 percent is paid by businesses
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
and another 18 percent is second
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
homeowners some of them may live in new
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire some may live out of state
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
they're all getting saved some money in
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
property taxes will reduce the property
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
taxes but
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the big selling points
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
is usually if we get only get more
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
people to pay income tax we can reduce
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
the property tax no because if only half
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
the people are paying income tax and
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's getting saved to property
 
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.750 align:start position:0%
everybody's getting saved to property
tax

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
you're all going to pay more that's
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
been proven in new jersey and
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
connecticut in the last 30 years
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
so anyway a lot of these schemes that
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
i've been looking at for now 32 years
 
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.470 align:start position:0%
i've been looking at for now 32 years
saying

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
well this is a way to save property
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
taxes no
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's a false
 
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.550 align:start position:0%
it's a false
idea

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
it won't work so i'm opposed to this
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
bill i don't think we should start
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
contributing to
 
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.710 align:start position:0%
contributing to
municipal

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
retirement systems again because it's
 
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.710 align:start position:0%
retirement systems again because it's
uncontrollable

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
and we all sit here trying to control a
 
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.750 align:start position:0%
and we all sit here trying to control a
budget

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
and say okay how much more are you going
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
to spend on that how much try to cut it
 
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.470 align:start position:0%
to spend on that how much try to cut it
down

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
we can do nothing about municipal and
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
county's funding funding from this place
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
all we can do is sit and watch it and
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
just keep paying more
 
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.949 align:start position:0%
just keep paying more
so

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
if we if we really do something like the
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
swept we can reduce property taxes but
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
any of these other schemes
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
the schools gobble it up so
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's my spiel on what i
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
remember from history of the retirement
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
system that was certainly the whole
 
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
system that was certainly the whole
waterfront

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:18.890 align:start position:0%
waterfront
 
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.030 align:start position:0%
waterfront
[Laughter]

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
i've been waiting to explain that for a
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
well done any questions from the
 
00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.389 align:start position:0%
well done any questions from the
committee

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
yes maury
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative very helpful background
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
you mentioned with regards to police
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
fire corrections over time whether they
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
want it or not
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
so my question is is there categories of
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
overtime mandatory versus voluntary and
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
is it accounted for
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
within those categories
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
i can't give you a definitive answer but
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
my belief is it is not
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
but you know so so okay do we count this
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
over time do we not count that over time
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
if it's compulsory do i get that added
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
to my retirement if it's not compulsory
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
as far as i know i don't believe
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
when it goes in to the retirement system
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
or when it goes into your payroll it
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
says whether this was mandatory or
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
or whether it was voluntary
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
so i i couldn't answer that exactly
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
representative alicia
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman uh good to see you
 
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.430 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman uh good to see you
representative

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
peter you and i were both on finance so
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
we started cutting uh
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
35 to 25 and ultimately to zero
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
and i specifically remembered as i
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
chaired division one at the time
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
that we all said at the time though we
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
can't make any promises that we would
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
try to restore some of that money at
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
some point to those communities maybe
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
not 35 or 7.5
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
as this bill is calling for but
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
something but did i hear you correctly
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
you don't think we should make any
 
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.350 align:start position:0%
you don't think we should make any
contribution

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities for retirement i
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
do not because it's too unpredictable
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
when we're trying to do 27 months out in
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
the future what's going to happen
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
in the budget that we put together and
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
we can't feel confident that we won't
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
see things like some of the previous
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
decades all sorts of hiring and pay
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
increases and i know this pay increase
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
is coming in the future because of
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
inflation will drive them
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
you can't get anybody to work unless you
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
go way up in pay so if you've got to
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
fill the job you're going to make pay
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
more and then you're going to have to
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
put more in the retirement system i see
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
a flood of that coming and
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
we just passed a budget that's going to
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
be affected in the next year and it's
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
still going to be the same budget and if
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
we said and we'll have to start
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
increasing pay in the in the in the
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
the only saving grace there will be
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
because there's so many vacancies that
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
there'll be extra money in the payroll
 
00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:56.789 align:start position:0%
there'll be extra money in the payroll
fund

00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
to make up for the probably the likely
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
pay raises that we'll be asked to
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
approve so
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
that that may come out okay
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
i have nothing further mr chairman
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you ken our
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative weiler for your
 
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.990 align:start position:0%
representative weiler for your
rendition

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
rendition
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
um just just a couple things one thing i
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
i do understand the exponential growth
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
in employees and communities and around
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
the like but i also understand that in
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
1967 the population in new hampshire was
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
under 500 000.
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
now it's 1.3 million so
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
this growth we're talking about there's
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
a correlation between population and the
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
demands on municipalities state
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
government and everybody else to serve
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
that population so
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not concerned about that
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
but what i am concerned about is i also
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
was here when we promised
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
the municipalities when that was taken
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
away that we would do what we can to
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
restore this
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
and here's and and i hate to be labor
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
appoint but i'm very serious when i say
 
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.789 align:start position:0%
appoint but i'm very serious when i say
this

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're sitting at a time now and who
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
knows how long that's going to last
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
where we have a
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
robust monies within the state coffers
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
we have still today may change soon
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh robust income to the state government
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
and we just sat in this division and i'm
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
sorry to say this
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
and there was a vote to send five
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
to individuals
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
who were
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
shamed by a ponzi scheme
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is a ponzi scheme
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
only are successful
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
desire or greed of the people they scam
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry i can't reconcile given
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
five million dollars to that
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
and reneging
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
on a promise we made to communities
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the people that serve those
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
communities and they all do serve those
 
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.710 align:start position:0%
communities and they all do serve those
communities

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
um that we made some years ago
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
based on an unknown factor and that's
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
what i understand you to stay in
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
anything we do here
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
all those unknowns always exist
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
and all we do is the best we can
 
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.029 align:start position:0%
and all we do is the best we can
to

00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
have what we decide to do come in line
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
with those unknowns and not get
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
destroyed by them just like you
 
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.549 align:start position:0%
destroyed by them just like you
mentioned

00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
many many times
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
the overestimates of revenues and we go
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
back to 2008 but what never gets
 
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.669 align:start position:0%
back to 2008 but what never gets
mentioned

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
and this can happen again and it will
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
happen again sometimes as the entire
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
economy collapsed
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what we were dealing with and
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's when we
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
through necessity
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
had to borrow money bake bone steel cut
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
where we really didn't want to to make
 
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.270 align:start position:0%
where we really didn't want to to make
payroll

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:53.990 align:start position:0%
payroll
so

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
and when i i did that as a company
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say if i had to make cuts
 
00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say if i had to make cuts
um

00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
i had to make promises or i had to make
 
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.430 align:start position:0%
i had to make promises or i had to make
commitments

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
commitments
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i had to keep those commitments or i
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
was done so
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i do not agree that we should
 
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.149 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i do not agree that we should
not

00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:13.430 align:start position:0%
not
fulfill

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
fulfill
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm talking about only
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
the obligation that we made
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
to communities and the people that serve
 
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.149 align:start position:0%
to communities and the people that serve
them

00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
10 years ago
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
i think or 12 years ago whatever it was
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
i think we should fulfill that thank you
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your talents mr chief
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
i in answer to those two situations the
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
5 million
 
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.270 align:start position:0%
5 million
was

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
similar to the 100 million we're now
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
looking at for people who are abused by
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
government employees in the in the
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
sununu youth development center it also
 
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.950 align:start position:0%
sununu youth development center it also
happened

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
by the by the attorney general and the
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
bank and commissioner also lied to
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
people put out false reports and
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
investors relied on that information so
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
we're paying off for their mistakes from
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
back 10 12 years ago
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
but they deliberately lied
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
none of those people are in those
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
positions anymore and have been for
 
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.549 align:start position:0%
positions anymore and have been for
years

00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
we are giving money back to the towns
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
they can use it for property tax relief
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
i've heard as high as 300 million some
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
of it through arp funds some of it the
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
100 million that we all know about
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
through the swept we're all giving we're
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
giving more money back but here's the
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
big difference if we decide to give
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
money back to help the towns
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
we give it back in a way we know the
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
exact amount this is the big difference
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
this is the big difference we know we're
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
giving you 300 million back for this
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
biennium here it is
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
do what you will but if we say okay we
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
agreed to pay a portion of this
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the portion is
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
that makes it very difficult when you're
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
doing a budget when i do a budget i have
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
to know where the money's going i have
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
to know how it will result and i have
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
auditors to go out and tell me what the
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
results were and if it didn't go the way
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think it is we'll change it but
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
i have to know how that money will go up
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
if i give you an exact amount i know
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
where that money's going but if i give
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
you a promise to pay a certain amount on
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
something something i have no clue
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
what that certain amount will be so you
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
see from a budgeting standpoint which
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
we're all working on very hard for all
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
our time and all our devotion here in
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
this committee is we got to know exactly
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
what what we're giving away and i don't
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
know it when i promise
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
a percentage
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that that i can't do
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
and still try to make a budget that
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
makes sense so
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
that's why i oppose giving a percentage
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
of something we are giving a percentage
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
of the meals and rooms tax we are
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
promising that
 
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.470 align:start position:0%
promising that
but

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
we can't we won't give it out unless we
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
get it
 
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.470 align:start position:0%
get it
so

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of related so that
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
makes it easy
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
represent griffin
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
as i read this bill the fiscal impact is
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2024
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
and none of us know what the revenue
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
stream will be then that's true we're in
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
a high five
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
inflationary period now
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
there's a war going on in europe
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
and we could be facing a recession in a
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
in a flash
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm reluctant
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
to commit the next legislature
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
to spending and that's what we would be
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
doing i agree if we if we uh completed
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
this bill i agree
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.230 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative

patience
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien would you like to
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
make any comments
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm representative
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
michael o'brien i currently serve on the
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
house edna committee
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
for clarity in my credentials
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
i also am a vice president of board of
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
aldermen for the city of nashua
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm also
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
was a firefighter for 35 years and
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
currently receiving a pension from new
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement system so i think
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
between where in the hat
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
within the state and the municipality
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
and the helmet on the fire department i
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
have more than a fairly well
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the new hampshire
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.640 --> 00:27:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative just as a i think i don't
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
think your mic is on
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that's much better thank you
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
so much uh i'm sure they heard me
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
because i got the profound irish voice
 
00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:03.669 align:start position:0%
because i got the profound irish voice
so

00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
i'll have you know i'm passing out the
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
papers the family did kiss the blondie
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
stone before they left and i did too but
 
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.830 align:start position:0%
stone before they left and i did too but
anyways

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
this is truly if you look at it
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
a property tax bill
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
now if you look at one of the sheets
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
this was prevent presented by
 
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.190 align:start position:0%
this was prevent presented by
the

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association the
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
other letter is a cover letter for the
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
city of nashua now i can speak about the
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
city of nashville if you look at nashua
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
particularly in the figures compiled
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
that i have to agree with being on the
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
budget committee for the city of nashua
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
i did ask our cfo
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
to look at it that is over north of two
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
in the city of nashua two million
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
dollars equals one percent of the tax
 
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.110 align:start position:0%
dollars equals one percent of the tax
rate

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
so by this 35 percent lack of payment
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
costs the taxpayers
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
of nashville one million dollars
 
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.870 align:start position:0%
of nashville one million dollars
so

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
this could go to relieving the property
 
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.510 align:start position:0%
this could go to relieving the property
tax

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.269 align:start position:0%
tax
now

00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
it says there was a lot of problems this
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
is not anything to do with spiking
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
but you know if you want to talk about
 
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.070 align:start position:0%
but you know if you want to talk about
spiking

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
spiking
 
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.110 align:start position:0%
spiking
geez

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
geez
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
we changed the whole system for one
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
person in dover a police chief
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
and really kind of screwed the pooch on
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
other different things
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
statewide because i was of the opinion
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
if anybody works any type of overtime
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire new hampshire
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system makes a deduction out
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
of that paycheck goes into the fund and
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
what i know about banks and funds and
 
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.070 align:start position:0%
what i know about banks and funds and
investitures

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
investitures
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
that money will double
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
and receive a profit by eliminating the
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
overtime that went into
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire retirement system
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
greatly in my opinion hurt the system
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps mr collin could explain money's
 
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.110 align:start position:0%
perhaps mr collin could explain money's
lost

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
by removing that now you say
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative moani and moony you
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
the point of uh overtime and do they
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
have a chance or opportunity
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think that goes by each individual uh
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
municipality and go by each contract
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
that the municipality works under
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
but basically i can give an example in
 
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.149 align:start position:0%
but basically i can give an example in
nashua

00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:26.950 align:start position:0%
nashua
where

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
you signed a list to work overtime
 
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.909 align:start position:0%
you signed a list to work overtime
and

00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a voluntary list for you to
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
sign on but you cannot refuse it once
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
you get it
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
if you cannot work and you must seek
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
somebody of
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know of equal caliber to work that
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
particular overtime
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
that particularly holds true on
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
christmas eve and christmas day and
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
holidays and everything else
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason we have that is because
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
we value the life safety and i'm sure
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
other communities do
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's what overtime does we're talking
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
policemen and firemen
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire back door
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
told municipalities how to run their own
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
public safety
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
took away that opportunity
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great fault in my
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
opinion right there
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
we'll hire firefighters back because we
 
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.149 align:start position:0%
we'll hire firefighters back because we
know

00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
the type of force that is needed to
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
fight a particular fire firemen get hurt
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
they go to fires and they put themselves
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
at risk sometimes they make the supreme
 
00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:31.350 align:start position:0%
at risk sometimes they make the supreme
sacrifice

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
sacrifice
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
so when somebody gets injured and now
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
with a you know broken leg or a broken
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
knob or whatever is
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
their issue we need to backfill and
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's where the overtime comes from
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
also there's vacation and sicknesses we
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
just went through covet we had
 
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.990 align:start position:0%
just went through covet we had
firefighters

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
you know you can't choose being a
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
firefighter on a medical run not to
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
treat a covet patient it was the same
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
thing in my active career we had the
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
same issues with somebody that was hiv
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
positive we never refused anybody
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
but sometimes you do get sick of
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
different things and exposures
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so you need the back coverage and
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
that's where the overtime came in and
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
like i say every dollar that i made in
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know there was better ways to
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
control the spiking
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't done
 
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.029 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't done
now

00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
again i have to say
 
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.630 align:start position:0%
again i have to say
looking

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.269 align:start position:0%
looking
um

00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
looking what the individual
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retirement system
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
you've got to look at
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
part of the deal that's not really
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill but
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative weiler mentioned
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
employees contributions kicked up
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
firefighters and police were paying
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
nine and three-quarters percent
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
into the pension system
 
00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.950 align:start position:0%
into the pension system
now

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
police officers pay 11.5 and
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
firefighters pay 11.8 i don't know what
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
the difference of 0.3 percent is
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
between policemen and firemen when
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
traditionally firefighters end up
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
spending longer careers
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
in you know working for their
 
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.029 align:start position:0%
in you know working for their
municipalities

00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
but when you take that's basically two
 
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.509 align:start position:0%
but when you take that's basically two
percent

00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
lack of earning power of the employee
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
when you take that chunk of two percent
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
where do you think the employees go to
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
make up that two percent they come back
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the municipality and they say to the
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
municipality i'm not making as much
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
money as i used to because it was taken
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
up within the increase in the pension
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
system so you inflated
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
the wages
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
of the employees
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that also hurt too
 
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.029 align:start position:0%
and i think that also hurt too
but

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
i when you ever figure a pension system
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative weiler there has been
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
talk in the past
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
of oh
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the example nashville you pay too
 
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.990 align:start position:0%
in the example nashville you pay too
much

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
well isn't it the lara percentages
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
and basically if you make
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
let's say five dollars an hour and
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
somebody else makes ten dollars an hour
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
you put it you know take two percent out
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
the person that's making
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know two percent on ten dollars is
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
putting more money away it's equal in
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
the lower percentages the employees are
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
covering their particular costs at like
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
i say eleven point eight or eleven four
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
point five percent so it should equal
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
and out so there is a big thing the big
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
gap that occurs right now is looking at
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
the numbers and look at the
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
amount of cities and towns
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
and i think somebody from the new
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association can
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
explain it better but you can see the
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
how this really is a property tax bill
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
that affects the towns now my
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
pay back to 35 percent you committed to
 
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.310 align:start position:0%
pay back to 35 percent you committed to
it

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
in 1967 and in 2012
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
it supposed to sunset and go back to the
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
or at least implied
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
and it didn't
 
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:12.790 align:start position:0%
and it didn't
so

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
believe me this is bargain basin
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
basement pricing
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
coming up to help out your cities and
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
towns to go into seven and a half
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
percent it will go a long way to really
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
support so i hope
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
i answered some of your questions and i
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
think we have other people that probably
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
back up you know more than what i say
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
here so not to waste your time but thank
 
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.270 align:start position:0%
here so not to waste your time but thank
you

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
would you entertain questions oh
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely anyone have any questions for
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%

thanks mr chairman uh nice to see you
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien and to you sir
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
do you know where the seven and a half
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
percent number came from
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
no and i'm quite if i may say so if you
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
look at the author of the spell the lead
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative was representative
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
cushing god bless us so
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
and uh what a wonderful gentleman and
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we all agree
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh you know terrible and his
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh untimely passing
 
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.150 align:start position:0%
uh untimely passing
uh

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
but uh he's the one that authored this i
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
did offer one previously at five percent
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
it did not make it past the house if you
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
remember uh last year that would have
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
been a better bargain basement deal for
 
00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:28.310 align:start position:0%
been a better bargain basement deal for
you

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
i have to strongly agree and i agree
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
with this seven and a half percent so it
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
came from the original offer
 
00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:38.150 align:start position:0%
came from the original offer
but

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the city of nashua if you look at the
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
numbers it is really coming out to one
 
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.470 align:start position:0%
numbers it is really coming out to one
percent

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
so if that is reflective it probably
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see that more along trending
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
maybe with the other municipalities as
 
00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:53.349 align:start position:0%
maybe with the other municipalities as
well

00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
well

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
i represent the new hampshire municipal
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
association and i did just want to say
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
that we did put together an anecdotal
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
survey with 62 political subdivisions
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
submitting what this bill
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the impact would be directly on
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
their budgets
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
and excuse could you
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome i get
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
asked that a lot
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
um so i did just want to um reiterate
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
that this is anecdotal some did the
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
exact calculation down to the penny
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
others did a little bit of rounding but
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
it was to show that there's overwhelming
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
support from the municipalities and our
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
association that's this would in fact be
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
greatly beneficial to our new hampshire
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities school districts there's
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
a county represented here as well as a
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
fire village district so i can certainly
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%

they
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
when they looked at this bill
 
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.109 align:start position:0%
when they looked at this bill

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:06.870 align:start position:0%
they
recommended

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
itl on the bill
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
and i know when it went into the on the
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
floor of the house
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
on the initial vote
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
itl passed
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
and later in the day when numbers were
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
dwindling in the house
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
there was a reconsideration motion made
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the bill passed by a tiny margin
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
but i keep coming back to the fact that
 
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
but i keep coming back to the fact that
uh

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
we have no control over the hiring
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
of uh municipal employees
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh so it's a
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's really a moving target
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
but more importantly
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact of this is in
 
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.150 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact of this is in
2024

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
and we as a current legislature i don't
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
believe should be committing
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
a future legislature
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:05.910 align:start position:0%
