a couple questions
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%

three

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
there are two statements uh the last
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
sentence of number of statement number
 
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
of number one is the UCC which refers to
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
the um uncompensated care cost is then
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
split evenly between state and federal
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
funds and then the next paragraph States
 
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
so what's being split
 
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.409 align:start position:0%
so what's being split
sure

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
um good morning members of the committee
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
my name is Nathan white I'm the Chief
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer of the Department of
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
this item here we are there's a couple
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
of things going on as you'll see in the
 
00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:44.099 align:start position:0%
series of tables number one is we're
 
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
accepting additional federal funds
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
number two into the division of Medicaid
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
services budget then you're seeing those
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
funds transfer into New Hampshire
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
Hospital's budget
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
um the funds that we're accepting uh
 
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
these these represent the um the the
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care costs and so when
 
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire hospital to come up
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
with the figures they're looking at what
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
were our expenses what were the revenues
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
that we received and and there's there's
 
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
a little bit more methodology to this
 
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
but then what is the difference and that
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
total difference from that 50 is state
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
if it was Medicaid and 50 or sorry
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
Federal and 50 was State and so the
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
funds that we're receiving here these
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
represent the uncompensated costs of the
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
state and so there's there's two um
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
allotments that we're pulling from one
 
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:38.420 align:start position:0%
is from our 2000 19
 
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
audited dish figures which is about 3.4
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
or I don't know about 3.4 million off
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
top of my head and then the remaining
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
amount is from 2021 the estimated
 
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
amounts that we have we still have
 
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
several hundred thousand dollars in the
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
future that we may come back to fiscal
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
for once we uh go through the audit
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
process but that is what that represents
 
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:00.860 align:start position:0%
uh representative Erv
 
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
so when it says the source of funds 100
 
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
Federal how does that jive with what you
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
just said the source of funds that we
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
are accepting is a hundred percent
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we are receiving from
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government as part of this
 
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
the federal government as part of this
program

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
the original expenses that the state
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
incurred that were uncompensated were
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
were 50 state 50 Federal but what we're
 
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
getting back is a hundred percent
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
federal funds to cover the 50 of the
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
state side
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
okay so the federal funds are covering
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
the state portion yes of uncompensated
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
costs okay
 
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
so the bigger question I have is this
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
makes reference to a fiscal note from
 
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.370 align:start position:0%
makes reference to a fiscal note from
2022.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
and basically says everything in that
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
and pretty much everything I may not I
 
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
mean be a little bit inaccurate there
 
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
but many of the things that were in that
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
note are now being funded in this note
 
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering what happened to the
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
5.6 million dollars that was funded in
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
good morning Ellen Lapointe the CEO at
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Hospital thank you for the
 
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
question so in terms of the projects
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
that are being funded there were some of
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
these projects that had to be unfunded
 
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
and have the funding rerouted to make
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
the enf construction project as well as
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
the forensic Hospital construction
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
project hole so that speaks to the vast
 
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:24.980 align:start position:0%
majority of why
 
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
you're seeing some redundancy in some of
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
these projects with our request
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that was there a separate
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
thing that came through fiscal that
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
related to returns for those funds yes
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
there was a separate item we brought
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
forward two items La it might have been
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
last October to fiscal for approval to
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
cover some of the increased costs
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
related to to construction where we
 
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
repurposed a portion of these funds I
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
don't remember off the top of my head
 
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.490 align:start position:0%
don't remember off the top of my head
857

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
857
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
000 is coming to mind for some reason I
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
can certainly provide that to the
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
committee if that would be helpful yeah
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
it'd be great to send me then of course
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
then fiscal notes that reference what
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
Senator D'Alessandro moves to accept
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
item 267 and I believe it was Senator
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
bird cell seconds
 
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none you ready for the question
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
all in favor say aye aye oppose no that
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
item is adopted next item that is
 
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
removed from consent is under tab seven
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
and again it's a recognize
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
so my question here is down at the
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
bottom of page three
 
00:13:14.569 --> 00:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
it talks about the the bottom line
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
purpose of this
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
initial Grant here is to be eligible to
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
eligible to apply for a four-year Grant
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
to actually do the work and my question
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
about that is is it known at this point
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:30.779 align:start position:0%
we know non-federal funds used in the
 
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
implementation of whatever that Grant is
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
if it's approved
 
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
so good morning for the record I'm Katya
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
Fox I'm the director of the division for
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and New Hampshire is
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
eligible to apply for um the four-year
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar Grant at the end of
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
the planning process there were 15
 
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.180 align:start position:0%
grants that were awarded
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
across the country similar to this one
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
and 10 of those States will be eligible
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
for that multi-million dollar Grant in
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
it will be a hundred percent federal
 
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.629 align:start position:0%
it will be a hundred percent federal
funds

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
further questions on item 268 Senator
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
gray not really a question but we
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
noticed that in this item the word
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
retroactive is in there certainly we are
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
interested in making sure that all of
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
these and we even started the process
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
early this year to make sure that we
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have these so again comment and
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'll entertain a motion to adopt FIS
 
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.509 align:start position:0%
I'll entertain a motion to adopt FIS
23268.

00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
for a second all right representative
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald moves Senator Dallas
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
Andrews seconds to adopt item 23 268 is
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion seeing none
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
of you ready for the question all in
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
favor say aye
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%

00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
tab seven
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%

h

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
looking now at FIS 23 251
 
00:15:48.839 --> 00:15:50.269 align:start position:0%
looking now at FIS 23 251
.

00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
.
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
I believe a senator had a question on
 
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.110 align:start position:0%
I believe a senator had a question on
this

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Senator Dallas uh
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
directed nice to see you this morning
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
what's what is the story of the fish
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
hatcheries now we had X number that we
 
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
were going to look at we were going to
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
cut that down to it to a manageable
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
number and refurbish those situations it
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
it currently there's a discharge from
 
00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
the Fisheries that's contaminating uh
 
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
either the soil or the water what's the
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
story there how are we dealing with that
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
uh good morning my name is for the
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
record my name is Scott Mason executive
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:35.339 align:start position:0%
um Senator we are still actively in
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
litigation you reference
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
um the discharge at the Powder Mill
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
Hatchery over New Durham
 
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and we are still in active litigation
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
um the judge has held his decision
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
pending final negotiation between EPA
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
and clf and New Hampshire Fish and Game
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
on how we're going to come into
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
compliance with our new neptis permit
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
for the discharge over there
 
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.370 align:start position:0%
for the discharge over there
um

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
so I still
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
you know at this point we're still we're
 
00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:10.339 align:start position:0%
still in active litigation so it
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunately limits exactly what we can
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
talk about until we finish that
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
litigation I will say that we are
 
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh actively working with EPA and clf I'm
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
actually meeting with them tomorrow on
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
um and we are anticipating an agreement
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year on how we will
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
come into compliance with our new permit
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
at New Durham
 
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.710 align:start position:0%
at New Durham
um

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
we're currently working with our with
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Public Works
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
Department on an RFQ for a design
 
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:48.020 align:start position:0%
project on on rebuilding Hatchery
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
and we received two permits on the RF
 
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry two proposals on the RFQ and
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
we are actively negotiating with our
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
first choice and I believe I I would
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
dare say we're making good progress and
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
we anticipate being before the uh
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
governor and Council in December with a
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
proposed contract for design on Hatchery
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
you know rebuilding hatcheries then
 
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.029 align:start position:0%
you know rebuilding hatcheries then
um

00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
we are currently actively working on
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce any discharges that we
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
have our two hatcheries that obviously
 
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
the new Durham Hatchery
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
um we have a problem there and the other
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hatchery where we have a problem as far
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
as the discharge goes is up in Berlin
 
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
and we're actively working at both
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
hatcheries to try to reduce the
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
discharges coming out of those
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
hatcheries the
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
the new Durham one we we're still not
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
quite meeting the 12 parts per billion
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
discharge permit that the net that the
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
neptis permit has even with all of the
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
changes that we've made there
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
um changing our best management
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
practices there changing the type of
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
feed we're feeding the fish
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
um in Berlin we are actively looking we
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
have changed where we're keeping the
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
fish and we are no longer actively
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
discharging a New York Pond which is a
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
water body that has uh phosphorus
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
contamination issue
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
further questions too further question
 
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
so what would all of this is is taken
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
care of
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
how many fish hatcheries will will still
 
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
be active
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
I don't have an exact figure at this
 
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.690 align:start position:0%
I don't have an exact figure at this
time

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.710 align:start position:0%
time
um

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
the the goal that we're going to have is
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
to maintain current Fish Production so
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether I have three
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
hatcheries or five hatcheries or six
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
hatcheries the goal the governor has
 
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
given to us is to maintain current total
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
Fish Production
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
the the three you know one of the
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
reasons why we like to have hatcheries
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's just easier for transportation and
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
stocking if you know if I had one big
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
hatchery in the central part of the
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
state it would
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
um we would have to change you know our
 
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
Fleet of trucks and we'd have to change
 
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
the way we do some of our stocking
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
um so for us
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
um it's a little easier for us to have
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
you know multiple hatcheries spread out
 
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
through the state

item item 15 misleadius the New
 
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Youth Development Center
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
claims Administration that settled but I
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
was under the impression that
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
they were going to come today and give
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
us an update on where things stood with
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
regard to what happened with the
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
settlement with the settlement how many
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
cases have been adjudicated
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
how many cases have been settled by by
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
the administrator the amount of money
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's been expended the amount of money
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's left and what the costs have been
 
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:18.260 align:start position:0%
for managing this this uh Administration
 
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
up up to this point I have I have seen
 
00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:24.059 align:start position:0%
duber's articles
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
that indicate
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
that people have been contacted and then
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
the ball has been dropped and things
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
have fallen apart there was one uh these
 
00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:37.700 align:start position:0%
three women were were uh I guess
 
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
initially contacted interviewed and then
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's what's happened it seems like it
 
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
that the case has fallen through the
 
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.649 align:start position:0%
that the case has fallen through the
cracks

00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
cracks
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh two things are happening the statute
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
of limitations is is coming rather
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
quickly and our decision with regard to
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
the program at the end of it is coming
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
rather quickly
 
00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
now we've been told again this is
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that's 100 million is not
 
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
enough well if it's it's not enough how
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
much has been spent where has the money
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
been spent why is it why is it not
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
enough money at this at this point in
 
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
time there's got to be a rationale for
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
what we're doing uh
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
and it's it seems to be we we need to be
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
updated on this we're it's our
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility we've we voted to put
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
this in place and uh we we ought to be
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
making sure that it works and at this
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
point in time it it doesn't seem to be
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
to be working there's there's one case
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
that was settled and I believe there's a
 
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:40.580 align:start position:0%
suit in place against
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
the the person who settled it because it
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
was supposedly the case of another
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
person and so there's a lot of
 
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
controversy uh around this situation we
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
need some clarity on what's going on
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
this is a major situation facing our
 
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.690 align:start position:0%
this is a major situation facing our
state

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Shea can you fill us in you know
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
obviously we have no item in the in the
 
00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:07.250 align:start position:0%
obviously we have no item in the in the
book

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
so as the members that um received the
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
email I think from Mike Kane the
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general and the administrator
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the uh settlement fund are
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
discussing um based on the last uh
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee meeting some ideas for
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
potential changes
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
um improvements some which may need a
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
legislative change and they weren't
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
ready to come before fiscal today
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
um we had put that on our agenda we had
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
left it there because at the time we
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
weren't sure if we were going to get
 
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.149 align:start position:0%
weren't sure if we were going to get
something

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
so I think the intention was um that
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
they maybe come back next meeting
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
but they do report on a quarterly basis
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
to some of the issues that Senator
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
D'Alessandro is concerned about in terms
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the number of settlements and the
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
costs that have been
 
00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.110 align:start position:0%
costs that have been
um

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
to the fun to that day for that quarter
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
there was a request for a private
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
meeting I believe but it couldn't be
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
with the whole committee because that
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
would be illegal but are there any
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
people that are particularly interested
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
in this that would like to hit being on
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.059 align:start position:0%
uh comment on that I I have made the
 
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
suggestion that you know they meet with
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
the Republican caucus and the Democratic
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
caucus which is allowed under our RCA
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
91a and
 
00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:27.299 align:start position:0%
will accomplish what we are intending to
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
do so that has been the suggestion that
 
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:31.820 align:start position:0%
I've put out there
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
and would accomplish I think what we
 
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
needed to happen
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll see if that's possible
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
um just we're talking about the caucus
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
of the members of the committee yep yep
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
all right I'll see if we can arrange
 
00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
all right I'll see if we can arrange
that

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
chairman I recall the administrator of
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
the fund was here recently was that as
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
recent as last month yes thank you he
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
gave he had a fairly extensive request
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
for changes to the
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
so the rules which we granted and he
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
also had a fairly lengthy discussion of
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
the procedure as it's moving forward and
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
we also had quite a list of of numbers
 
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
of people they expected to come forward
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
and it was fairly extensive
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
the number of cases that they had
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
preliminarily discussed as Senator
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
D'Alessandro has mentioned we knew that
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
this has been ongoing for quite some
 
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
time and
 
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
expected to make further progress at
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
this meeting but so far nothing but we
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
will have those meetings we'll set them
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
up and uh
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
we'll let everybody hopefully will come
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
to some conclusion so
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
are there any other items under
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
information that people would like to
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess we're ready for
 
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
review of the
 
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:30.769 align:start position:0%
review of the
audit

00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
I guess we're finishing up earlier than
 
00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
I was delighted to finally find out that
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
they're having an audit on this
 
00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%

controls over the form 1099 vendor
 
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
income reporting process to ensure
 
00:46:55.609 --> 00:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal tax requirements
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
in observation number eight located on
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
page 17
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
we recommend the department continue to
 
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
provide All State agencies with guidance
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
and training for establishing a new
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
vendor including when vendors require a
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
state contract what documentation should
 
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
be obtained and the retention policy for
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
those documents
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
we also recommend establishing
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
monitoring controls to ensure that state
 
00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:23.099 align:start position:0%
agencies are complying with those
 
00:47:23.099 --> 00:47:25.870 align:start position:0%
agencies are complying with those
requirements

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
observations number nine and number 10
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
recommend the establishment of policies
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
and procedures observation number nine
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
calls for the Department to establish
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures requiring the
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
timely inactivation of vendor accounts
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
that will no longer be used and
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
observation number 10 recommends the
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
department established policies and
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
procedures to properly restrict system
 
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
user access permissions
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
or mitigating controls if permissions
 
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:00.560 align:start position:0%

identifies errors in New Hampshire first
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
vendor data and recommends the
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
department established criteria to only
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
update active accounts and do so in a
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
controlled and timely manner to enhance
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
observation number 12 on page 24
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
recommends the department first perform
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
procedures during and after vendor
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
establishment to ensure vendors are not
 
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
federally debarred
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
second inactivate the barred vendor
 
00:48:40.609 --> 00:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
accounts in New Hampshire first and
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
third keep the department listing on the
 
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:45.540 align:start position:0%

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
recommends the State Treasury and the
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
department work together to to determine
 
00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
if a more efficient and secure vendor
 
00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
enrollment payment process
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
can be developed using a self-service

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
recommends the department work with the
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
statutorily established advisory
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339 align:start position:0%
questions uh I said a statement from the

questions uh I said a statement from the
Comptroller

00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
Comptroller

cop trailer uh I do I want to Echo uh
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
the thanks to the LBA for helping us
 
00:49:59.930 --> 00:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
with this effort in terms of pointing
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
out areas where we can look to guide our
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
policies in the future
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
um this took probably good off and on
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
over a year I think of in in a good way
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
they really uh dug in to the deepest
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
areas of of our financial system
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
um and given that we're looking to go
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
forward with an upgrade to our financial
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
system this is a great tool to help us
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
sort of set those policies now as you
 
00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
can see some things uh did get
 
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
decentralized over the course of the
 
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
last several years and we don't have a
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
real strong control in in Das
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
specifically so this will give us the
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the bandwidth to to work on that
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
so appreciate it and I am happy to take
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
any specific questions in from my area
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
pressure trip committee members Senator
 
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
dalessandro oh thank you thank you nice
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
to see you again good to see you too
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
tell me about the capability of our
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
system to adjust to these changes
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
will it require new modules uh well what
 
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
exactly is is required I remember the
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
transition from the old system to this
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
new system
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
and that was that was a compass of a
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
tedious process which we've had bitty
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
bitty bitty uh me and I wish to to
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
figure but how about this the reports it
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
it's interesting but uh it indeed talks
 
00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:27.829 align:start position:0%
it's interesting but uh it indeed talks
about

00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
I think very significant changes that
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to be made are they costly
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
and how how is this going to happen I
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
mean I will say that uh this is vendor
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
creation so we have very strong payment
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
controls in terms of payments going out
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
the door our accounts payable system is
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
is very solid in that sense
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
um what we've done over the years is by
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
policy allowed agencies or even
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
divisions within Das to have controls of
 
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
different stages of vendor creation so
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do is sort of have
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
a new workflow in the system that would
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
allow such as my division to have sort
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
of final approval on something from a
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
tax perspective we're the ones who have
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
to determine who gets 1099 forms and the
 
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
like so sometimes if we are not in from
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the process we can't
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
really fix it at the back end but what
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do is get insert our
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
controls at the beginning of the process
 
00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:23.420 align:start position:0%
better so that we don't have as much
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
correcting to do at the back end I do
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
think our system even today but even
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
more so when we upgrade will allow us to
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
Senator gray uh so I took that as a
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
partial response to seven on page 16 17.
 
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:45.290 align:start position:0%
partial response to seven on page 16 17.
uh

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
you know you talk about uh decentralized
 
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
and everything again a lot of that
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
seemed to fit in with your your previous
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
statement I'm interested in what we're
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
doing to make sure it doesn't happen
 
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
Okay and whether that's a check you know
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
at some point in the process because
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
these others are you know injuring data
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.049 align:start position:0%
or something
um

00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
I always get concerned when I see you
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
know Greece in part okay and I always
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
try to to ask questions about that
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
because there ought to be some kind of
 
00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:26.579 align:start position:0%
actionable item with a date certain that
 
00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a plan to fix it or
 
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
whatever so I'll shut up and let you
 
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.069 align:start position:0%
whatever so I'll shut up and let you
talk

00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
talk
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
in in the internal control world we we
 
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.910 align:start position:0%
in in the internal control world we we
obviously

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
um we're never going to be 100
 
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
um accurate is we want to try to set up
 
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
controls to minimize the number of
 
00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:46.190 align:start position:0%
controls to minimize the number of
Errors

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
Errors
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
um I will say that we've had multiple
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
audits directly from the IRS and we have
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
fared pretty well in regards to 1099s
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
and w9s and those buzzwords that you
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
hear from the IRS
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
um which is I guess new for the state in
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
my time because prior to my time I don't
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
think we had had any IRS audits so I was
 
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
a lucky one but I I think that it's a
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
continuous Improvement cycle I there is
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
you know there are steps we can take to
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
try to catch as many things as we can
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
before they go out the door and that's
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do is sort of
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
bring some of that centrally so it's not
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
so decentralized we're a big
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
organization we pay a lot of bills and a
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
lot of vendors as you can see 200 000
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
plus active vendors so there is a lot to
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
manage but
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
you know our group which is a relatively
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
small group and accounting services is
 
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
gonna is gonna make every effort to try
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
Sherry Rockburn I'm the assistant
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department the only
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
thing I want to Echo in terms of Dana
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
and I think it responds to both Senator
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
D'Alessandro and Senator gray is that uh
 
00:54:57.650 --> 00:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
last year your committee had approved
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
um money for us to do the infor upgrade
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
of our financial system in terms of what
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
we get with that one of the things
 
00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
that's part of that package is as Jim
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
had mentioned a supplier Vendor Portal
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
for them to do some some self-management
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
and and gather information be more
 
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
efficient so a lot of the the
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
features that we're getting with the
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
product that we've already are procuring
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
has a lot of these things in it so as
 
00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:27.140 align:start position:0%
Dana said this is sort of a really
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
perfect timing in terms of getting this
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
so as we're working with our implementer
 
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
with our new system our upgrade we can
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
start to implement some of these changes
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
with that that's about a two-year year
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
and a half two-year implementation for
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
the full upgrade there'll be pieces that
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
may come on board sooner than that but
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
that just gives you a little sense of
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know what are we doing going forward
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of systems a lot of the things
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
that are in this report are going to be
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
addressed with our with the upgrades
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
that automatically come with that that
 
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.589 align:start position:0%
that automatically come with that that
product

00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
um observation number six you have an
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
but the write-up seems to indicate a
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
rule change
 
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
right we identified that one with an
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
Asterix because we considered the The
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative rules committee to be
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
part of legislation
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
so well then on the the last comment the
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
Department administrative Services
 
00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.609 align:start position:0%
Department administrative Services
response

00:56:36.609 --> 00:56:36.619 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
they say that they have changed it
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
and have
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
changed that rule
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
did that
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
straighten out what does that help with
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
that observation does it
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
does it correct it or do we still need
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
to try to do some legislation
 
00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.970 align:start position:0%
to try to do some legislation
ah

00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I
 
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
certainly at this but I'm not 100 yeah
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
we think it does correct it we yes we
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
think it does correct it I only have one
 
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
more day to file I want to make sure
 
00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
right I mean I get it right yes we
 
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
believe it does but uh I to be 100
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
certain I would want to go back and look
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
at it to confirm and say
 
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
okay but basically it was the rule that
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
you want to change rather than law
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
correct correct it was the rule it was
 
00:57:29.569 --> 00:57:29.579 align:start position:0%
the rule that was that we had seen the
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with okay right Senator
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald for a question
 
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
same thing okay
 
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:37.790 align:start position:0%
same thing okay
um

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you found an area that had been
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
overlooked for so long would work thank
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
you because obviously when we find more
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
inactive vendor accounts than we find
 
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
active ones sometimes a Nova looked for
 
00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
a very long time
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
emotion right move to accept place on
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
file and release to the public in the
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
usual manner the
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
second audit
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
seeing any ready for the question all
 
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
those in favor say aye aye
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
oppose note
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
the motion is adopted thank you for your
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
good work and I guess administrative
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
Services got some catching up to do but
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
I guess they're on the way
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
this is always helpful that we find out
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
things that we have overlooked for far
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
too long
 
00:58:37.079 --> 00:58:38.329 align:start position:0%
too long
so

00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
good work and we look forward to it
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
now we work on the date of the next
 
00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:48.109 align:start position:0%
now we work on the date of the next
meeting

00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
I have requested that we go to a
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
Thursday again because of I have a
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
conflict on the on the Friday
 
00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh 20th would have been the third Friday
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
is there any problem with going to
 
00:59:05.569 --> 00:59:05.579 align:start position:0%
Thursday for for the
 
00:59:05.579 --> 00:59:07.910 align:start position:0%
Thursday for for the
LBA

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
LBA
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
we have no issue on that date
 
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
I have
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
I guess in the morning a gel car but we
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
start at 10 so and then I'm an alternate
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
on gel car so as long as we do it in the
 
00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.210 align:start position:0%
on gel car so as long as we do it in the
morning

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
I can do that because Thursday afternoon
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
the retirement system meeting is
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled for one you're busy
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
so it didn't have to be the morning
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
meeting so we could do uh 10 o'clock on
 
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
Thursday the 14th 19th
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I'm in the wrong month

01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
is acceptable
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
