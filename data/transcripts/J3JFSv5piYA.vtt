00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:48.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%

room um okay then we have so yeah so
 
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
Roman three is that Roman numeral
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
problem about the that statute right now
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
say commiss report
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
daily and but they have a joy monthly
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
do you guys have
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.230 align:start position:0%
do you guys have
this

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:43.390 align:start position:0%
 
think

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
aot we want everybody at home okay great
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
help so your question
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
was approved areas where would not be
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
would where would areas not be approved
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
yep essentially okay my understanding is
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
where areas would not be approved would
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
be something like
 
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.990 align:start position:0%
be something like
bathrooms

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
bathrooms
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess May and it would a parking
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
lot well Ted technically you can't go
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
outside the four walls of the buildings
 
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
even with this bill so I would assume
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
that that would mean no parking lots um
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
I'm think the bathroom was done by rule
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
the department did that by rule they
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
didn't even do we didn't actually have a
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
statue about the bathroom right but no I
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
don't think any business would want to
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
be able to have a drink in the bathrooms
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
anyway that's just going to lead to
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
problems right um what about
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
Lobby so I think that's where it gets
 
00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.039 align:start position:0%
interesting because if I'm coming from a
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant and I walk through the lobby
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
to get to the elevator or whatever it
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039 align:start position:0%
I would think that would be an approved
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
area under this change so next is the
 
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.149 align:start position:0%
area under this change so next is the
paragraph

00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
four and I apologize I'm running late so
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
ex can hear you breathing hard those
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
stairs are tough when you're running up
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
know so F first thought is is to the
 
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
number of registered guests to that room
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
so there aren't is only usually one
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
registered guest in any given room right
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
whoever books the room and I I don't
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
think there would be any scenario where
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
a hotel would necessarily ask for the
 
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
list of names of people that are staying
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
in any given room so that would be
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
really hard to enforce my hotel a little
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
dicks Bay there in Virgin Gorda wants to
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
know who else is in the room interesting
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean this we're talking about a
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
festar hotel and they want to know the
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
spouse's name well well yes but that's
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
more for you know your spouse's name so
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
they can personalize their service to
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
you but the average hotel um likely
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
would not ask for that information and
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
then it gets into the whole weird thing
 
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
about well if you list the children who
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
are under the age of 21 is this now a
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
privacy concern or issue blah blah blah
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
blah blah so it starts to spiral into a
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
place that I don't know that we want to
 
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.029 align:start position:0%
place that I don't know that we want to
go

00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:54.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
frankly other than that I think you know
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about partially consumed
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine from the lounge to the
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
guest room I think that's okay I think
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's frankly I think that could
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
technically be allowed on the current
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
statute with the whole leaving of a
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant with a open bottle of wine
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
that's properly packaged Etc in this
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
case we're just not asking for it to be
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
answer everybody sure so uh you know
 
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.350 align:start position:0%
answer everybody sure so uh you know
somebody

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
having you put your sound on yeah you
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
put your mic on please I'm just thinking
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
about um how you would in if if you to
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
have parties you could say look you can
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
be drinking but after 12 parties over
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
you know something like that because
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
there are other people in the on the in
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
the hallway and well that goes back to
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
there's another part of title 13 and and
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
look enforcement could speak to this
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
better than I but it's the control of
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
your premise right so you have to have
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
control of your premise you can't let
 
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
things just kind of get out of hand and
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
go crazy I would also suspect that an
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
average hotel if somebody was being loud
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
or going too late they're going to get
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
complaints at the front desk they're
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
going to shut it down anyway so I don't
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
know that that's really something you
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
want to necessarily address in statute
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
but operationally that's exactly what
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
would happen all right and then you know
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
another area that occurs to me that
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
maybe your a hotel would not want to
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
allow drinking drinks an unapproved area
 
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking if they have a hotel pool
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
or an exercise room something like so I
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
think there would be scenarios where
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
they would not want it to be um
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
essentially allowed to have have alcohol
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
areas right so you leave it up to the
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
discretion of the owner I think so yeah
 
00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:41.799 align:start position:0%
because I think most businesses are
 
00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
going to make this the smart choices for
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
themselves and their liability insurance
 
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.870 align:start position:0%
themselves and their liability insurance
frankly

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.990 align:start position:0%
frankly
right

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you good all right
 
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
so as I said uh this bill has three
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
parts to it now it's going to have uh
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
1582 and then the third part is is just
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
that loose end that came up with the
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the bill we've already
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
passed out a committee which is the uh
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
the uh Liquor Commission Bill and that
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
was where the daily the month issue got
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
solved so that's section two of the
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
bill okay uh anybody in the audience
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
have a problem with anything you see
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
here see none okay anybody in the
 
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee have any
 
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.029 align:start position:0%
committee have any
questions

00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
yes so we'll we'll be we can vote on
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
this this piece yes yes we can well
 
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
there'll be a voting 1151 then when we
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
get to 1152
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
1582 we'll just interim study that so in
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
case something were to happen to this
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
bill we could but the the number of
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
registered guests bother me I stay at
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
pretty decent hotels I travel constantly
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
no one has ever asked for my name so
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
that means I would never be allowed I
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
would never show up as registered and
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
therefore could never have a
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
drink this is it it's it's not written
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you could go down
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
with your spouse and go get the drink
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
the issue was the question was uh you
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
know how many people are going down and
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
grabbing a
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
drink but that's not what it says right
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
what what part are you you're concerned
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
about I'm looking at line
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
16 okay for the purpose of this
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph the number of alcohol beverage
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
shall be limited to the number of
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
registered guests to that room who are
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
age 21 age years older Believe It or
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
Not hotels very much want to know how
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
many people they're in or they do count
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
the number of people but count that's
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
all that that's all it's
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.070 align:start position:0%
all that that's all it's
saying

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
register well shall be limited to the
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
number of registered guests so the
 
00:30:09.149 --> 00:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
register is when you or when you book a
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
room you tell them how many people in
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's no you don't usually no no excuse
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
me excuse me let's let's clarify what
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
the word registered means in your mind
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
registered means they have my name no no
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry John that excuse me okay so
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
what do you think registered means
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
so when it says double
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
occupancy what would you write if you
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
were on a
 
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
booked package they would ask for how
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
many occupancy but if you are going on
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
your own you know husband wife going on
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
your own they don't usually ask I have
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
never been asked my husband has never
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
been asked believe it or not you are you
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
you are booking the room based on double
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
occupancy whether I know it or not
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
whether you knew it or not
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
exactly okay if you say so you learn
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
day they well let me put it this way I
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that they actually change the
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
price between a single occupy and double
 
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
occupany but they ask it just so to get
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
clear maybe you know the industry can
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
tell us why why they insist on asking
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
because I think they're more worried
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
about whether you go beyond the
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
two that's when that's you know when the
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
can of worms start opening up and so uh
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
I would say is that but that the
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
Assumption most of the time when you do
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
that booking if you were actually to
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
print it out and read the fine print
 
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll say double double occupancy
 
00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
now I would know uh pretty much every
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
every web page I've ever seen they the
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
first thing they ask you is how many
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
people gu
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
you do it online right's a lots to do
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
it uh if you call on the phone that may
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
be true they might not ask you but I I I
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
don't know I I I can't say but I'll okay
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
good we I'll tell you what we can you
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
can uh we can write that in the blurb to
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
make clarify
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
that that is the legislative intent that
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
that covers double occupancy
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
okay all right so who's on this
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
okay post car's taking burs okay SPI is
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
not okay but when you say Carrie you
 
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.269 align:start position:0%
not okay but when you say Carrie you
meant

00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
spear he gave me Spear's name but she's
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%

okay okay and then who's this six seven
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
that's okay okay so who who do we have
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
here let's confirm see who's actually
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
here we have pusk we could do some cross

here Sullivan is
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
here so now we have six without exactly

okay

00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:17.150 align:start position:0%
 
on

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay um I assume you're going to be
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
the you're going to want to pass this
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
right and I'm I'm I'm opposed to it
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
because I just don't think there's a
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
need for it we're we're not New York
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
we're not New York we're not what we're
 
00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:40.839 align:start position:0%
not New York well I mean this we don't
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
have to stay open to 4 a.m. and that's
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
on what this does no I see 3: a.m. 2 2
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
a.m. I say 3 a. 2 am. 2 amm 3: a.m. if
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
if 2: am is a current law No 2 am is the
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
current law if they opt in this will
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
allow any town in the state to be 2:
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
a.m. 3:00 a.m. is if you opt in so this
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
basically puts us in line
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
with the majority of States we are in a
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
small minority right now and so that
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's I think it's a I think it's a
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
good reasonable Bill to kind of
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
modernize the way we are this isn't
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
making us New York or Vegas or anything
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
like that right but the the question is
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay in terms of and so I did a ton of
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
research on this like looking at
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
academic papers and studies and the
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
results are pretty mixed like the idea
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
that there's all sorts of problems that
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
come from extended
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
hours there is no consensus on that
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a bunch of studies from
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
Ontario I can read through them all
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
Ontario California um and there Ireland
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh England and extending hours is very
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
mixed in some cases it leads to more
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
problems in some cases it actually leads
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
to fewer problems so there is no
 
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
consensus amongst the academic literat
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I just think it's I think this is a
 
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
good step to
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
modernize and make us more in line we're
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
one of okay here's my here's my
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
compromise here's my compromise is that
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
um so right
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
now the LI I see I see what I was look
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
the lcy May sell to two if the town
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
voted for it so you want to add that to
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
another hour no that's not the part I
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
care so much about um we can leave that
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
you can take that out if you want well
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
well I want to take out what I want to
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
take out is on the premise may sell from
 
00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
6:00 AM to 1 a I want that to be the
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
standard so no I want that to I want I
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
want that to be the standard but that if
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
the license he wants to sell
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
Beyond 1:00
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
a.m. and you could say up to 3:00
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
a.m. then that has to be voted on by the
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
town so reason I'm doing this just so
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know is that there's an economic
 
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
impact here and that's law called law
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement and so therefore it's an
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
economic impact to the state because it
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
means that that we we're having our
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
liquor our liquor enforcement has to be
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
stay up late and we have and have to
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
have extra hours and could be overtime
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
hours which could be even more money
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay so I I'm just saying is is that if
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
you if you want as my spirit of
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
compromise that LE the current law at
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
the 1:00 a.m. but that if you want to go
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
add extra hours it needs to be voted on
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
by the town so my spirit of compromise
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
would be the opposite let's let's keep
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
let's move to two and we could take off
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
to 3:00 am. so that it's just
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
two okay that's now we have two differ
 
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
opinions on this let's ask committee
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
members what do you think I I don't
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
think we should be I don't think we
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
should be I will tell you if the Senate
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
sees that 2 am. I know
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
they're going to kill a lot of things
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't start
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
the discussion because at the end of the
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
day New Hampshire is well let's go for
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
for let's let's just know I'm not let's
 
00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:08.839 align:start position:0%
just challenge them and see what they do
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
with it I'm not even I'm not even doing
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm not even advocating for that
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
what I am now if you think fine let's
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
let's turn into a New Orleans be open
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
all night or Vegas I mean I'm not that's
 
00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:22.839 align:start position:0%
that's not what I'm trying to do I'm not
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
trying to turn us into New York or Vegas
 
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
or New Orleans I'm just trying to make
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
us more in line with our competitive
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
States so Vermont allows to their
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
society hasn't crumbled Massachusetts
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
does too their society hasn't crumbled I
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
mean Most states have we are one of 10
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
states that doesn't go to 2 2 a.m. okay
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
I know for a fact that Cambridge closes
 
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.870 align:start position:0%
I know for a fact that Cambridge closes
at

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
1 well maybe have the option maybe
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
Cambridge does I I don't think actually
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
that is not true I've live there and
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
I've been out to 2 a.m. in Cambridge no
 
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
I always we always had to go from
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
Cambridge when was this John well
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
70s okay yeah so I liveed there in the
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
2010s and I can tell you it was open
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
till 2 that they moved it to two that's
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
because they were probably they were
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
tired people leaving town do you want me
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
to leaving you like me to take you to
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
Cambridge and show you how how vibrant
 
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
it is at 2 a.m. I mean come on like it's
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a big deal it's it's not
 
00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
going to be the end of the world the the
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
academic studies which I spent hours
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
researching shows that this is not a big
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
deal and yes it it might require
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
changing around Resources with respect
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement but like that doesn't
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean they have to spend more
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
money they can like just reshift
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
scheduling like you could have fewer
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
people on at a different hour or sh
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
start things like there's there are
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
flexible ways you can do
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
this 40 states do this the Hampshire's
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
not going to crumble if we if we become
 
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
more modern it's not about crumbling I
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
mean Hello we haven't passed the
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana we're the only state in New
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
England hasn't pass the marijuana have
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
we crumbled no we are but people don't
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
want to pass it cuz they appear seem to
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
think that we will crumble if we do pass
 
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
it this seems to be the fearmongering
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
that drives all this sort of stuff
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
do yeah but what time to the towns have
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
to get to okay so you're okay with the
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
bill as it is written okay
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative pus do you have an
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
opinion I would be remiss if I
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
didn't um I like the idea of leaving it
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
at one and with the
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
option uh to go to three on by local
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
conditions or local uh folks okay so
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
right now we have
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
three two so representa spe you're the
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
did you ask me what's that did you ask
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I kind of like the idea that the
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
town should pick right but but at what
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
time do the town should pick starting at
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
I don't they could pick any time as far
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned if the town agrees to
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
four o'clock in the morning I don't care
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
oh as long as the town decides yes we
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
can handle it well that's a whole
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
another question where's my liquor guy
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
can a
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
town have set an ordinance and and and
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
shut liquor stores down earlier than one
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
bars in our current law Li stores bar no
 
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.630 align:start position:0%
bars in our current law Li stores bar no
no

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
barss yep sure why can't the owner shut
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
it down what well the owner could shut
 
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.710 align:start position:0%
it down what well the owner could shut
it

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
down requiring this is just enabling we
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
like enabling right yes we liquor
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
enablers are not supposed to be good
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
people we' already passed few enabling a
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
lot of just no that's not the word you
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
use thank you chairman and committee
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
members the way the statute reads now is
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's RSA 17917 hours of sale it says uh
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
on premises licenses may sell from 6:00
 
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
a.m. to 1:00 a.m. 7 days a week the
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
lensey May sell until 2 a.m. under
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
conditions authorized by the legislative
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
body of the city or town in which the
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
premise are located if the legislative
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
body adopts an ordinance authorized such
 
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
sales right so the question I'm asking
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
is can a
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
town um have an an or an an ordinance
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
that says we want the bars to close at
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
one if we were to pass this let's say
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
let's say for right now could they have
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
them could a town pass an ordinance to
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
shut the bars down at
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
midnight I suppose they could do that um
 
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.109 align:start position:0%
midnight I suppose they could do that um
I

00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
any legislative body local legislative
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
body that has done that and and quite
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
honestly right now we only have three
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the state um that have
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
opted to stay open until 2
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
a.m. and those are Berlin lonia only on
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
we's Beach and NASA and in NASA it's
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
only for the charitable gaming
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
licenses so there's very few community
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
is even using the 2:00 so your hopes of
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
getting this
 
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.109 align:start position:0%
getting this
in

00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
Littleton Beth
 
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
a't I mean why can't why is it why can't
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
it be this is the default and if the
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
local towns don't like it they can
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
always that was that's my art what I'm
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
saying is that is that as long as the
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
town local town could pass an ordinance
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
and say we want to stay at 1:00 a.m.
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
then then I I have no I have no argument
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
oh yeah if we if we you want to write it
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
that way I'm fine so if the town truly
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
is against it then they can they can be
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
on record saying we're against it but
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
the default in the state should be twoo
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that compromise okay legis
 
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:18.829 align:start position:0%
 
located

00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
um oh all right fine let's just pass
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
let's just pass this since it's going to
 
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
kill it anyways but okay all right
 
00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.630 align:start position:0%
kill it anyways but okay all right
that's

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.750 align:start position:0%
that's
fine

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
Sullivan want a second
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay move thought to pass any discussion
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
motion uh all those in favor say
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
I one two three four five okay that is
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
zip nope and those
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
opposed two SEC so it's five to
 
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.829 align:start position:0%
opposed two SEC so it's five to
one

00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right relative to contract
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing of beer Wine and Liquor so
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
this is the one we have to still do more
 
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.150 align:start position:0%
this is the one we have to still do more
work

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.150 align:start position:0%
work
on

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we'll take this up
 
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.670 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we'll take this up
later

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.150 align:start position:0%
later
needs

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay so what is the problem
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
just so we all know what the problem is
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
problem it's yeah sorry why don't you
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
there thank you chairman and committee
 
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.750 align:start position:0%
there thank you chairman and committee
members

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
the the issue here is this is very
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
technical changes in the bill allowing
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh the liquor manufacturers and the wine
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers the privilege to enter
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
into contract brewing and tenant Brewing
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
or tenant manufacturing contract
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Arrangements like the the
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh beverage manufacturers have been
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
allowed to do and doing so there's
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
there's is a lot of legislative change
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
in this the issue right now that is
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
being discussed is getting the language
 
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
around the bever the uh
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
contract uh manufacturing definition in
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
the contract manufacturing Arrangement
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
correct in the years past and when the
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
legislation was initially passed that
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
language was opposite of what the uh um
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
Federal standard is and their
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of a contract um agreement
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
and a contract
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
manufacturer so it all comes down to who
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
is the the contract and who is the
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
Brewer and that's what we're trying
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
trying to solidify to make sure it's
 
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.589 align:start position:0%
trying to solidify to make sure it's
right

00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from anybody so the
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
bill is is we're no we're still needs
 
00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
more Amendment we're still because we're
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
trying we're trying to take care of the
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
wine guys we are currently working with
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Brewers Association to
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that this is this is uh right
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
as you know they're the ones that
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
entered the original bill for the
 
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%

zip okay
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%

here all right HB 1380 relative to uh
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:24.430 align:start position:0%
 
licenses

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:41.589 align:start position:0%
okay
but

00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
so okay so um we if you all remember
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
last week we had a long discussion about
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
the underlying issue
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
here and um it's the beer
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
distributors and who want very much to
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh do not want us to pass this bill and
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
they wanted us to do the uh allow this
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
lensey to go forward as a nano even
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
though he's clearly not an Nano and and
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
be a nano for for whatever hour that we
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
want him to be an a nano for an hour and
 
00:51:23.549 --> 00:51:23.559 align:start position:0%
then assuming that we're going to pass
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill um change it um is so
 
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
just to tell everybody my I have spent a
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
lot of time dwelling on this issue and
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
my initial reaction to it when I first
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
heard about the bill the issue um is
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
still my my reaction today so from 2017
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
to wherever I am on this bill hasn't
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
really changed and that is that um The
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
brw Hub is the is has always been the
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
ultimate um anti three- tier statue
 
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
right out of the G it's it's it's
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
through three tier in the trash can they
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
try to somewhat uh go through the
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
motions by saying well the Brew Pub is
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
really a beverage manufacturer that just
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
happens to have a license to to you know
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
an off Prem you know the on- premise
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
license but in the end of the day I I
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
don't see that at all when I go to a brw
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
hub to me um uh it's a restaurant that
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
just happens to make its own be
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
and uh and and the idea that we can that
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
if you make your own beer and you own
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
multiple restaurants you should sell be
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
able to sell it well you can because we
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
in that other build that contract Brew
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
which we still have a little issues on
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
it but that's what they do but the idea
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
of they making it on your home or your
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
own home recipe um it's like uh uh
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
you're a pie shop and you're making your
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
own pies rather than buying you know and
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
I just think that uh the one thing I
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
would change is I uh in the bill on line
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:15.559 align:start position:0%
2500 um and that way it is a that 2500
 
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
is a very dominous number that is what
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
exactly what the Brew Pub is allowed to
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
do now so if they didn't if they get
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
Beyond this 2500 then yeah they're
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
goingon to have to contract Brew you
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
know they're not going to be making it
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
in the in that in that restaurant uh
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
they've got to they've got to they've
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
got to think bigger and better at that
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
point and use the contract Bru statute
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
yes repr spear the 2500 is that per year
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
year so by reducing that that's
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
allowing Michael Timothy to be able to
 
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
do what he want so Michael Timothy would
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
would could certainly work with this
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay now I I realize you know
 
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
Scott's not going to be happy and uh and
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
he he can take up the battle on the
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
Senate side but at this point um that's
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I feel I'm I'm
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
recommending we do but uh um I'm willing
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
to listen to anybody wants to argue with
 
00:54:21.549 --> 00:54:21.559 align:start position:0%
my with my logic but it's just that I
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
um The Brew Pub The Brew Pub if you know
 
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
if they have multiple loc it just the
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
idea of passing something and knowing
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
that it we that Nano statute is going to
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
change and I just I just I just think
 
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
that's really awkward and I do want to
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
pass this bill I want to pass this bill
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
but I just want Amendment for next when
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
so we you get two weeks SC we're not
 
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
going to take it up for two weeks so and
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
then you know that the amendment will
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
take up the amendment two weeks from now
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
and then at that point um we then bring
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
it to the full
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
committee so I'm just at this point
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
we're not voting on it now I just wanted
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
how everybody feels about of that
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes representative I'm not on
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee but I did have a quick
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
question yes how did between the
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
licenses and the tiers how did this get
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
so complicated I tried to put a matri
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
together you'll never understand it
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
nobody understand did it just evolve
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
over time it seems so so onerous and
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
every time we can't solve a problem we
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
come up with a new
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
license like Band-Aids on top of
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids it just seems like very
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
complicated it's I always called it
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
Byzantine is my my adjective um I would
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
also say this is kind of job security
 
00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.309 align:start position:0%
also say this is kind of job security
for

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
me the
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
only but and that's only because I've
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
been doing this for so long I think
 
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
businesses change every year business
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
business models change every
 
00:55:58.589 --> 00:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
year moving
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
forward well I I would say I before I I
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
would always say okay it's this was the
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
only law that's the upside down law
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
where every every other law is
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
everything's legal until we say you
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
can't do it and and and create licenses
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
so you can't so we can take your license
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
away to stop you from doing but in this
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
case uh uh I did um after going through
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
my vacation rental and learning about
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
zoning that that that zoning and liquor
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
laws are very similar in the sense is
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
you that the zoning specifically tells
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
you what you can can't do and I and I
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
watched this firsthand in my town when
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
it was over a tire
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
warehouse okay which is T and that and
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
they and it went to the courts they they
 
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.510 align:start position:0%
they and it went to the courts they they
they

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
went because uh the zoning allowed for
 
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.910 align:start position:0%
went because uh the zoning allowed for
auto

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
auto
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
repair and the issue was was Tire you
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
know but that said no tire you know
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
Warehouse was a tire was different it's
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's retail right it's not repair and
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's a tire and so they lost lost the
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
ability we lost our ability to have a
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
tire warehouse and
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
wrench but not not withstanding that
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
that um what makes our liquor laws so
 
00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
convoluted and so complicated is that um
 
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
at the time when the three tier concept
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
which was to go after tide houses which
 
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
was definitely afraid of
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
a large Brewer like anheiser Bush taking
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
over the you know the marketplace and if
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
you go and and if example I give you if
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
you ever go to England and they and they
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
actually the licenses are are based on
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that they're not tide houses or
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
are tight houses you know they actually
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
have their whole license structures
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
around whether it's a it's a free I
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't know it's not free I forget the
 
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
name of the word that the Brit the
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
British have anybody know what that's
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
called what they the British they have
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
it uh um but anyways it's it's LIC and
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
and then so but that yeah they thought
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
it was fair fine that Guinness could own
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
their own bar and Guinness you know has
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
their own establishment and that's all
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to get is Guinness and
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
Guinness products
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
whereas um so for us you know we at that
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
time we said no we're not going to allow
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
that at all and um even though you know
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
I always was amazed when you go to the
 
00:58:21.549 --> 00:58:21.559 align:start position:0%
airport and I see a Sam Adams restaurant
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
in the airport well that's just they're
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
licensing the name
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know right and so yeah they can sell
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
other than same Adams products in there
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
because they're just
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
selling right well then so well that's a
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
that's part of the three tier in anra
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
Bush they they're not going to sell you
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
anything else other than an anra Bush
 
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
product or inbev product at this point
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
but um so uh uh I it is true it's very
 
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
convoluted but I would say everything
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
comes down to the fact that be because I
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
call this this is a mother mayi so every
 
00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:56.839 align:start position:0%
time someone comes over with a brilliant
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
idea of what to do and like we you know
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
we talked about um you know the one we
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
have this time where some guy is he's
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
he's he's making the product in Maine
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
and he wants to bring it in the
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in a bottle or making it
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and Bott so it's
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
just there's so many different things
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
that you never would have thought of and
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
and the one I always think going back
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
was when flag Hill first showed up here
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
and and he said you know was really
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
great you know it's a nightmare I I get
 
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
to distill this
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
you know John Stark vodka but I can't
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
sample it I can't taste it I can't do
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
anything and so then we start chipping
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
away a letting him be able to give
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
samples and B letting him eventually to
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
actually have the product on the Shelf
 
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:43.039 align:start position:0%
rather than say hope you like it but you
 
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
got to go down to the state Lor store to
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
buy it okay so yeah and every and then
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
when you take the three different and
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
then the other things that really makes
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
it complicated is that every different
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of at we have we have a different
 
00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:57.789 align:start position:0%
kinds of at we have we have a different
tax

00:59:57.789 --> 00:59:57.799 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
structure okay so you start out right
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
from the beginning where we had that we
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
we said beverage and we didn't decide
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
what a beverage was we just said
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
anything than 6% or less is a beverage
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
and we really didn't care about what was
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
in it and and we have this outrageously
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
low tax of 30 cents a gallon and then
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
you and then you go from there when you
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
say okay those guys wanted to do
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
something that was more than 6% oh my
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
God what are we going to do specialty
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
beers do we want to change the tax
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
structure no you know and then and then
 
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
you know the you know there was a period
 
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
of time it's I would say it happened
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
before me beer pubs did happen before me
 
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
and but there was a period of time where
 
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
you could not get wine in the grocery
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
stores you had to go to the liquor store
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that was a quite a hurrah
 
01:00:48.029 --> 01:00:48.039 align:start position:0%
to let go of that so so anyway that's
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why we have this
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
Byzantine system
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
and so I hope all of you will stay here
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
long enough so that you can you know be
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
as be an expert like me right or I would
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
even call myself an expert because I'm
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
constantly constantly saying what
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
exactly did what exactly is
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
so okay so we will take up Brew Pub and
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
that be prepared for an amendment that
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
will reduce uh 5,000 to
 
01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.829 align:start position:0%
will reduce uh 5,000 to
2500

01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
2500
 
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
okay you
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
have yeah so we're not going to take any
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
action on that no I know but give you my
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
what Bill what bill is this number why
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
I it's okay we can do no I thought I had
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
my okay we'll get a copy
 
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right 1540 relative to the
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
definition of full course meal and full
 
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
service restaurants for the purpose of
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol licensing this is this is my
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
bill and I worked with Danielle and came
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
up with a really good Amendment but I
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
don't have it yet so we'll just have to
 
01:02:03.069 --> 01:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
move it to next time but Danielle was
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
totally on board I'm basically if you
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
guys see the bill I can tell you what
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
it's going to look like um so everything
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's new that defines Bill uh defines
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
the types of food that's going to be
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
deleted but we're also going to delete
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
what is deleted there that's so where it
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
says which ordinarily cannot be consumed
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
without using table wear that whole line
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
is going to remain um deleted and
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
then um in the new language at the
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
bottom there I'm going to
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
change at least um I'm going to take out
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
the 10 guests but I'm going to add in
 
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.910 align:start position:0%
the 10 guests but I'm going to add in
like

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
with um keep keep keep 20 but the
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
amendment says with Liquor's approval to
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
go less than 20 20
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
seats right so we're talking on line 20
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
sorry yep so on line 20 right now it's
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
cross so I'm going to go back to having
 
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
the 20 there but and then add in a line
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
that says which is what the amendment I
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
had last week but we never got to it
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
said but then I spoke to Danielle s more
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
and we camp with a few more things and
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
then on line 23 where the sentence that
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
starts with the menu shall contain
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
multiple options so that's going to be
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
deleted as well it's just going to be
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
meals shall be readily available and
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
served to the table so that will but all
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
the crossed out stuff would stay there
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
so it's going to
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
be I think I I I don't know if she's in
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
the room but I really appreciated
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
working with her she was great and she
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
understands my intent and we worked a
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
lot on it we had a bunch of
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
conversations on it so I think we're
 
01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:33.559 align:start position:0%
going to get to what I'm hoping to get
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
for without messing up Liquors
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement abilities so um the next
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
time I'll have this way in here
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you chairman I followed along
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
with um the notes from deputy chief
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
Elston and and uh that's consistent with
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
what okay she has come up with I like
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of figuring out exactly what is
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
the food you know the menu where the
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
food items are I really I do I do like
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
that the only thing I would add to this
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
is that uh we do have liquor rule on
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
this it's uh liquor uh rule
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
administrative Rule 50304 and that will
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
open up if this is passed right that
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
will open up 50304 for us to be able to
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
clearly Define some of that okay and
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
you're okay with doing it that way yeah
 
01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
I think it'll work it sounds like that
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
would give them the flexibility her
 
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
concern with some my things which didn't
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
particularly concern me but she was
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
worried about just like the can of
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
Campbell Soup being served and counted
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
or something those sorts of things which
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
which um you know that's fine it's like
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not like married to that idea I was
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
just trying to make it as broad as
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
possible so we could make it easier for
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
businesses to start but um I think the
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
language as I work with her will still
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
do that because it's just a diversified
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
selection of food that gives that that's
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
more broad than having these definitions
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
so I think it still accomplishes what I
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
want hopefully the rule making doesn't
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
become so restrictive that we end up
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
having to come back with a bill like
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
this in the future but assuming that
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen then I'm fine with
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
it you can't just have a can of
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
soup I love toatoa soup and things you
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
you put the little pasta that in that
 
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
preparation if I put some pasta in the
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
soup I yes I I definitely think we want
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
to uh keep the tradition of food being
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
required but being prepared the key word
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
is being the preparation is Right
 
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
correct so
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay good so we'll stay
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
stay tuned on that one all right uh
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
1582 um representative pusc moves uh
 
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:47.750 align:start position:0%
1582 um representative pusc moves uh
interim

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
study if you don't mind second this is
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
the one that we just took care of in in
 
01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:59.630 align:start position:0%
the one that we just took care of in in
11

01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:19.150 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay we're all set all those in favor
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
zip okay relative to of allowing
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
distillation of hobby
 
01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:37.589 align:start position:0%
distillation of hobby
Liquors

01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
Liquors
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
um I always pride of myself on being
 
01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
consistent and since I've now thrown
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
that rule out with cannabis I'm now
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
ready to pass this bill can I can I back
 
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
backtrack y are you do you know what
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
just went on with this bill who are you
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the three in the front
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for the last bill oh
 
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
are

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay um so I I'm I'm okay with just
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
passing this bill at this point um I
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
mean I was thinking should we put a
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
little disclaimer in there to let
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
consumers know that by the way there is
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
a federal law
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
but um I would was assured by the chief
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
that if if that were to occur that the
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
person would get a phone call from the
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
so other than that anybody else have any
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
other comments about this you going
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%

01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
idea okay so we know that not everybody
 
01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
thinks this is a good idea to pass it
 
01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:03.709 align:start position:0%
thinks this is a good idea to pass it
but

01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
yes you mentioned before that different
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
Liquors and different alcohols are are
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
taxed at a different rate correct do
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
these get taxed okay so the this the
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
first assumption is that is home
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
distilling so that means that the person
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
who is doing this is not selling
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
it if they sell it but no no that's then
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
they're violating our state law relative
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
to alcohol so that that then they needed
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
license and and yes they would have
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
attack structure
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:49.229 align:start position:0%
okay all
right

01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
right okay all those in favor of of P HB
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
1624 ought to pass please raise your
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
hand 1 two 3 four five
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%

okay so uh this was one that we had the
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
resolution done on Friday but because
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
Monday was the holiday it didn't get
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
done and I thought it was G to get done
 
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.149 align:start position:0%
done and I thought it was G to get done
by

01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
now what's the amendment uh John so the
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
REM yep on
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
33 yeah okay okay so I have was going to
 
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
add it to it but it turns out the Senate
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
has a bill they are going to uh extend
 
01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.070 align:start position:0%
has a bill they are going to uh extend
the

01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
sunset okay okay so I was I'm I'm
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
guaranteed in my mind that they'll pass
 
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
that so will'll get that bill and at
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
that point we can decide whether we want
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
to extend the sunset whether we want to
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
stick a marijuana bill on
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
it uh we could do all kinds of things we
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
might when we get that so at this point
 
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
take so we're just going to take up the
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
St bill when it comes over and not no no
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
out do with this guy um so like I said
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
we'll wait for the amendment I don't
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
know in terms given that it's not lunch
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.639 --> 01:16:33.629 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
is synthetic
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
THC made from H but it's made from H H
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
so it's not so is it so it's legal so
 
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
it's legal uh and what I what I was
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
considering was to um legalize it and
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
have the the tobacco people yeah
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%

03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
different kind of is compromise of time
 
03:39:09.269 --> 03:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
sharing interest this okay so so in the
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill as written
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
says this paragraph shall not apply if
 
03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
the condominium is comprised of time
 
03:39:17.950 --> 03:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
sharing interests
 
03:39:17.960 --> 03:39:19.590 align:start position:0%
sharing interests
only

03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:39:23.710 --> 03:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
section shall not apply and I'm looking
 
03:39:28.910 --> 03:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
on this piece of paper so this was you
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
must have worked from her
 
03:39:31.560 --> 03:39:39.229 align:start position:0%
must have worked from her
Amendment

03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
yeah does she have an amendment no she
 
03:39:43.510 --> 03:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
didn't even have an amendment this was
 
03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
that was just hand it out this a wing
 
03:39:47.950 --> 03:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
wing it
 
03:39:52.189 --> 03:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so are this
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
last should be a section or this par
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph seems like the wrong word
 
03:40:02.030 --> 03:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
so so good afternoon Mr chairman um for
 
03:40:04.229 --> 03:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Heidi croll I work
 
03:40:06.189 --> 03:40:06.199 align:start position:0%
at Gallagher cahandar tra and I'm here
 
03:40:08.269 --> 03:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
today representing Arta which is the
 
03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
American Resort Development Associate
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
so I was working off of an amendment
 
03:40:15.189 --> 03:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
that representative Aly presented to
 
03:40:18.510 --> 03:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
your committee on January 16th okay um
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
which I I don't have that with me I
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
apologize um and
 
03:40:27.790 --> 03:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
um which did solve one issue between the
 
03:40:32.670 --> 03:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
as introduced um and the amendment we
 
03:40:34.750 --> 03:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
needed to change the word from I think
 
03:40:37.790 --> 03:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
it was paragraph to section um and I
 
03:40:40.750 --> 03:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
think we got that part squared away
 
03:40:46.030 --> 03:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
um but did but on page two um d as you
 
03:40:48.070 --> 03:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
were mentioning it says this section
 
03:40:50.189 --> 03:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
shall not apply if the condominium is
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
comprised of time share interest only
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
and we are asking to remove the word
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
only um which representative Aly agreed
 
03:41:00.359 --> 03:41:01.670 align:start position:0%
only um which representative Aly agreed
with

03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
um okay so so chrisen you're working
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
from you have the original bill as
 
03:41:10.389 --> 03:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
introduced yeah okay so you see the word
 
03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
only at the end of that sentence so we
 
03:41:16.950 --> 03:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
only yeah and then and then instead of
 
03:41:23.870 --> 03:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
saying this paragraph should say this
 
03:41:26.550 --> 03:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
section so I'm going to mark up here go
 
03:41:29.590 --> 03:41:29.600 align:start position:0%

all the voting articles must be included
 
03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:21.000 align:start position:0%

the meeting must be deferred until the
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%

condominium owners in accordance with
 
03:42:35.790 --> 03:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
the provision yep I like
 
03:42:38.349 --> 03:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
that I don't have a problem with
 
03:42:40.990 --> 03:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
that and actually
 
03:42:43.590 --> 03:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
pass so this this is in the amendment
 
03:42:44.950 --> 03:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
this was in the amendment that she
 
03:42:48.790 --> 03:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
handed out at the hearing
 
03:42:51.510 --> 03:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
22 uh because we have one member of our
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:08.880 --> 03:50:17.309 align:start position:0%
 
all

03:50:17.309 --> 03:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:19.070 --> 03:50:19.080 align:start position:0%

03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah I'm fine with it I'm fine
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%

that's fine oh no no no in March okay we
 
03:50:48.030 --> 03:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
this is you know what I'm what I'm
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
struggling with is because we don't have
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
the folder to see who was for or against
 
03:50:54.309 --> 03:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
it so I'm relying on you John was there
 
03:50:56.429 --> 03:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
anybody against
 
03:50:56.439 --> 03:50:58.510 align:start position:0%
anybody against
1172

03:50:58.510 --> 03:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
1172
 
03:51:02.229 --> 03:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
against okay I don't want to see that I
 
03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
so the what do they cond they were all
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
they all supported yeah okay did Dario
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
supported it all right that's that's
 
03:51:13.590 --> 03:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
what I need to know so everybody had it
 
03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
was okay with
 
03:51:15.120 --> 03:51:16.950 align:start position:0%
was okay with

03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%

done
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
right just put a
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
cap yeah no that
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
she she was going on about how her
 
03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
Association had totally mismanaged
 
03:57:23.510 --> 03:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and and uh in terms of the
 
03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
improvements they didn't do in the
 
03:57:26.269 --> 03:57:26.279 align:start position:0%
improvements and right and then now they
 
03:57:29.110 --> 03:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
have to pay now they have to pay so much
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah more so I we can't pass this I I
 
03:57:34.630 --> 03:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
would say either interim study or kill
 
03:57:37.229 --> 03:57:37.239 align:start position:0%
it let's do inter study
 
03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
stud interm
 
03:57:45.590 --> 03:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
study wait a minute I just I want to
 
03:57:48.269 --> 03:57:48.279 align:start position:0%
understand amendment when I read that
 
03:57:48.279 --> 03:57:50.710 align:start position:0%
understand amendment when I read that
Amendment

03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:57:52.750 --> 03:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
um basically and I remember the
 
03:57:54.990 --> 03:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with people you up talking
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
about incompetent management right right
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
well she she was going on and she was
 
03:58:01.790 --> 03:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
used to be on the board she was a board
 
03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
member and then she was going on how
 
03:58:05.389 --> 03:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
they didn't they didn't they didn't do
 
03:58:07.429 --> 03:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
the improvements that needed to get done
 
03:58:09.469 --> 03:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
weren't they weren't prop maintaining
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
things and then and so then they they
 
03:58:15.950 --> 03:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
were had to do this Capital Improvements
 
03:58:18.990 --> 03:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
and she was opposed to it
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
well what it says here the way I read it
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
is that in order to go
 
03:58:29.469 --> 03:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
beyond improvements that exceed 5% of
 
03:58:32.550 --> 03:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
the budget of grow expenses shall be
 
03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
allowed without approval of the inment
 
03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
association so in other words you can't
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
they can't do what they did again you
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
know what I mean they spent a lot of
 
03:58:44.590 --> 03:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
money and then didn't do what they were
 
03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
said no I I don't remember that I my
 
03:58:49.110 --> 03:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
memory was they hadn't spent any money
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
and then they were doing a special
 
03:58:52.590 --> 03:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
assessment because they needed to get
 
03:58:55.630 --> 03:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
caught up to do these Capital
 
03:58:58.389 --> 03:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
Improvements right for 10 years no
 
03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance was done yeah so no Capital
 
03:59:04.110 --> 03:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
Improvements and we we asked her I said
 
03:59:06.269 --> 03:59:06.279 align:start position:0%
don't you guys put money away for
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements what they do with
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
the money yeah what
 
03:59:10.590 --> 03:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
and what
 
03:59:13.950 --> 03:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh and and where did the money go for
 
03:59:15.790 --> 03:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
the cast improvements but evidently they
 
03:59:17.870 --> 03:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
weren't putting the money away so it was
 
03:59:20.429 --> 03:59:20.439 align:start position:0%
really mismanagement and she was blaming
 
03:59:22.830 --> 03:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
the management company rather than the
 
03:59:24.790 --> 03:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
board which the board is the ones really
 
03:59:27.469 --> 03:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
responsible not the management company
 
03:59:28.830 --> 03:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
management company was just trying to
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
appease the board who didn't want to
 
03:59:32.910 --> 03:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
spend the money in the first
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
place um there's something here budgeted
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
gross expenses so that's
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
03:59:45.750 --> 03:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted and what I read is
 
03:59:48.189 --> 03:59:48.199 align:start position:0%
that no other
 
03:59:50.670 --> 03:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
assessment that exceeds 5% of the
 
03:59:53.309 --> 03:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
budgeted gross expenses shall be allowed
 
03:59:55.469 --> 03:59:55.479 align:start position:0%
without the approval of the unit Owners
 
03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
Association so in other words to me
 
04:00:00.349 --> 04:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
they're looking to
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
avoid spending money that are of putting
 
04:00:07.750 --> 04:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
budgets capital expenditure budgets and
 
04:00:10.950 --> 04:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
then doing anything and then coming back
 
04:00:13.229 --> 04:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
later and saying oh we need this
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
stuff and and the uh I mean maybe it's
 
04:00:19.030 --> 04:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
just not written right right well
 
04:00:20.750 --> 04:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
because you would say that anything
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
anytime it comes to the unit owners do
 
04:00:25.469 --> 04:00:25.479 align:start position:0%
vote on it no matter what right so they
 
04:00:27.630 --> 04:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
took a they took a vote on a budgeted
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
gross expense on a line
 
04:00:33.389 --> 04:00:33.399 align:start position:0%
item but but according to the narrative
 
04:00:33.399 --> 04:00:35.550 align:start position:0%
item but but according to the narrative
the

04:00:35.550 --> 04:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:39.309 --> 04:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
people the what are they call
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
condominium you
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
know board no not the board we always
 
04:00:47.670 --> 04:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
have a man the management firm didn't do
 
04:00:49.710 --> 04:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
it in other words they got the money but
 
04:00:51.309 --> 04:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
they didn't do anything so here's here's
 
04:00:53.229 --> 04:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing we don't have to vote on
 
04:00:55.750 --> 04:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
this today yeah we can put this off till
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
till March but you need to do some
 
04:01:01.590 --> 04:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
homework and figure out whether we what
 
04:01:02.910 --> 04:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
this bill really
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
means I think just in stud because we we
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good management outfit and
 
04:01:11.269 --> 04:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
is not a problem that we face right so
 
04:01:13.950 --> 04:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
maybe if I ask and and I urge you to
 
04:01:16.149 --> 04:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
watch the
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
Youtube Youtube watch the
 
04:01:21.910 --> 04:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
hearing mean what I just said no not
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:29.110 --> 04:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
then can we just or we can do inter room
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
study didn't write
 
04:01:35.950 --> 04:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
it interim study yeah with me okay
 
04:01:37.830 --> 04:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
interim study and if you find out
 
04:01:39.630 --> 04:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
differently then we'll take we can
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
reconsider to my my board and say but
 
04:01:43.469 --> 04:01:43.479 align:start position:0%
let's do inter room study we're doing
 
04:01:44.790 --> 04:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
inter room study now and then you go to
 
04:01:47.070 --> 04:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
your board and if so then we can bring
 
04:01:50.910 --> 04:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
it back up if they tell you okay okay so
 
04:01:53.510 --> 04:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative am and second by
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%

them a board to do monthly is tell a
 
04:03:09.070 --> 04:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
board do they have to do it
 
04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
monthly I mean I think they should have
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
it within 60 days I think it's quarterly
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
most people do it quarterly do we want
 
04:03:19.710 --> 04:03:19.720 align:start position:0%

04:03:22.269 --> 04:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
quarterly and then you get all the
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
