00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
to call on somebody to provide some
 
00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
information from the uh from those who
 
00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
are here I expect that there are far
 
00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 align:start position:0%
more people watching either live or the
 
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 align:start position:0%

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
this room so
 
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
welcome House Bill 69 has a number of
 
00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
different sections um the let me make
 
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
sure I'm close to the microphone um this
 
00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 align:start position:0%
bill deals with both medical issues

bill the first section of medical begins
 
00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 align:start position:0%

of Page Three uh page one so it goes
 
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
through with legislative findings that
 
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
speak to a lot of the background
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
information um and continues through the
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
end of page suits for a system of gender

section
 
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%
135-1 which provides
 
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
definitions that that is the top of page
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
four on um page page six line 7 there is
 
00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
135-20 is
 
00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 align:start position:0%
135-1 colon 3 which is a Prohibition on
 
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
use of public funds for gender
 
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.270 align:start position:0%
use of public funds for gender
transition

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
care turning to page seven line five
 
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
135g which is
 
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement same page line 26 there is
 
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.150 align:start position:0%
enforcement same page line 26 there is
um

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
135-1 insurance coverage um the first is
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
a mandate of no coverage the second is a
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
non- mandate that says that no
 
00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
organization shall be required to
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
provide coverage then at line 33 on page
 
00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 align:start position:0%
seven is when it transitions when it
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
moves to the second section which is the
 
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
public schools there's legislative
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
findings that begin there and move
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom of page eight where
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
there is a new subdivision in the
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
education laws regarding sex and gender
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
in public school um this they're all
 
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
within 193 colon 41 that would add three
 
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
different sections one about both
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment and teaching issues there's a
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
lot packed into that one single um
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
section then in Roman 2 um there's one
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
about um gender segregated
 
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.110 align:start position:0%
about um gender segregated
activities

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
that's on line 15 line 22 is Roman 3
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
which is about restroom
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
separation and then line 24 is where
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
there's the violation
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
section and moving to line
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
33 there is the the final section which
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
is conversion
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
therapy conversion
 
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
therapy when somebody is coerced to do
 
00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
something against their will is just
 
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely Terri
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
um the problem is that our language and
 
00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
our law is a little bit confusing which
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
is unfortunate
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
so my intention today is that we look
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
through this section by section and
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
figure out where there's an opportunity
 
00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
for conceptual agreement and when we
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
know where there may be some conceptual
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
agreement on working towards solution
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
then take a break I I was thinking it'
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
be lunch but maybe we'll take five 10 or
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
15 minutes just to be able to gather our
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts in any materials in any areas
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
where we have an agreement to work
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
towards agree work towards an agreement
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
in that section we will then come back
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
and talk about those sections and figure
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
out where we can find agreement okay is
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
that working for you that works that
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
works for me yes
 
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.309 align:start position:0%
works for me yes
fantastic

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of this is there's
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines and there's a lot of
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
discussion about leaving the practice of
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
medicine solely to medical professionals
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes in the past that
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
has not worked well um there was a time
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
when not only did doctors call some
 
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.629 align:start position:0%
when not only did doctors call some
people

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
undesirables they also sterilized
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
undesirables that was practice of
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
medicine but not something that should
 
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:18.879 align:start position:0%
have ever been allowed by civilized
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
civilization and in that situation
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
legislation to prohibit calling people
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
undesirables and to prohibit their
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
sterilization would have been
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate um there was also the issue
 
00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
of lobotomies that were done routinely
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
to people that should never have had
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
them and far too loose usage of electr
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
Shop Therapy that actually still is in
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
practice for some things in a severe
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
treatment resistant depression that is
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
the 14th I believe it's around the 14th
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
line now and I honestly commend anybody
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
who goes through 14 lines of treatment
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
for their resistant depression because
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
so sometimes the medical profession has
 
00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:06.919 align:start position:0%
not gotten things right um back in the
 
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
Tuskegee project they they denied
 
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
antibiotic treatment to black men who
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
had syphilis to see what happened in the
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
community and the natural history of
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
that that was ended in 1972 in the
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
United States but continued through the
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
90s in Costa Rica and it was that was
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
endorsed by the American Medical
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
Association at the time and it was only
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
apologized for to years ago so while
 
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
doctors and medical societies often get
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
things right there are some times when
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate to step in so the
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
question here is if there are some areas
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
where we look to guidelines we figure
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
out where there's already agreement and
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines and to say in the state of
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are going to set this
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
floor on requirements for
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
care um that is actually being done the
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy ban is legislation
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
that could be considered to interfere in
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine and um I think
 
00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
that maybe that might be the first one
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
that we could talk about um we there are
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
two organizations where I've turned to
 
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines the W paath the world um PR
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
practitioner Association provider World
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
professional association for transgender
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
Health yes World professional I
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
apologize I was getting the P section
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
wrong um they have a new standard of
 
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
care eight that recently came out and is
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive um there's also the
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
endocrine Society who has dealt with
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
hormones um and other endocrin and
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
endocrine disruptors for a very long
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
time so I I personally look to them
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
towards more of the hormone
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
treatment the the wac guidelines um let
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
me pull those up they have some
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines around conversion therapy and
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
the way that they Define it is beautiful
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
and Brilliant
 
00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:00.519 align:start position:0%
um they
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
I apologize for letting that one drop
 
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
go they use language that um conversion
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
therapy is attempts to compel a gender
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
diverse person through words actions or
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
both to identify with or behave in
 
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
accordance with the gender associated
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
with the sex assigned to birth I think
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
that that's actually a far more El
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
approach than what is in our existing
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
language and conversion
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
therapy um because right now it says
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
that it's to seek to change an
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
individual's sexual orientation or
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
gender identity against their will um
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
and um including sorry change an
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
individual sexual orientation or gender
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
identity including efforts to change
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
behaviors or gender expressions or to
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
attractions or feelings towards
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
individuals of the same gender um it
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
does have a carve out for transgender
 
00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:06.519 align:start position:0%
care but um I think that that actually
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
could be strengthened along with um The
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
W path guidelines which are to provide a
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
space for um especially children who
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
begin in early puberty to have the
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to continue to question
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
their gend gender ident identity um with
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
the expectation that that will help them
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
determine if they're solidifying to a
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
gender identity or if their gender
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
identity is different than that first
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
one that they had looked to because w
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
paath w path has expanded the defin
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
definition of different gender diversity
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
they've now included Unix they've
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
included a lot more and I believe that
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
those guidelines do a good job of making
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
sure that it's not reinforcing a binary
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
between being either male or female
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
transgender male transgender female and
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
it honors more of those differences
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
within the whole
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
Spectrum yes representative Shapiro yes
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chair um so it sounds like
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
you're not really talking about changing
 
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.590 align:start position:0%
you're not really talking about changing
the

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
intent um I don't think I don't have it
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
I don't have it in front of me but you
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
are talking about changing the language
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
and um the language you just read from W
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
wath wath um did not include
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
um samees seex relationships or samesex
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
attraction so would you include that
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
into that definition is that yes I would
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
add that to the definition my intention
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
if we're willing to work towards better
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
clarifying that language um would
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
obviously would to me it's obvious but
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
would include the same sex um
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
considerations as well um and just look
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
to take some of these this language and
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
better clarify the conversion therapy
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
language is that something that you
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
would be willing to consider working on
 
00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:57.829 align:start position:0%
would be willing to consider working on
you

00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.230 align:start position:0%
you
know

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
yes I'd be willing to think about that I
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
I'd want to I'd want to pull it up and
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
see it myself and think through it and
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
also um as I'm sure you're aware that
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
this this effort to um ban conversion
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
therapy like many of the bills like this
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
whole bill that we're working on right
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
now is a product of a campaign across
 
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.030 align:start position:0%
now is a product of a campaign across
the

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
country um and so you know
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
I would also like to see what the ram
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
think about what the ramifications are
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
for the people who have
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
um you know who have really been the
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who have fought for this in
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and around the country but
 
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
I but I but just
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
offand um you're talking about a more
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
clear language um I'm not opposed to
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
that and it seems to make some sense
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so it seems that I I will
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
query both both of you as well but just
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
to give a little bit more of what I'm
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
expecting that process would be is right
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
now we decide that yes we'll talk about
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more today and then
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
most likely anything that we come to we
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
have agreement towards language we would
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
then put together in an amendment form
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
and notice that so that we could get
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate input from those
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders especially if we do get any
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
agreement over any of how treatments are
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be provided um I would really want to
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that anybody is providing
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
transgender care New Hampshire today
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
would come and tell us if any of the
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
proposed language that we have conflicts
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
with the practice that they currently
 
00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
have in the state so yes so are you
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
talking about taking this up with an
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
amendment and with um and with hearing
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
from stakeholders within this work group
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
or when it comes to the big to our
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh that's a good that I
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
believe that we can have a non-main
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
hearing with the with this work group we
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
need to i' need to check with the clerk
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
if we are in fact willing to work
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
together of exactly how that would be
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
noticed but I would want to make sure
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
that any language we have has the
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for good public comment most
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
likely in this group because we'll be
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
the closest with it but we'd welcome our
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
other members on the committee to sit in
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
to see yes so personally I'd rather see
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
that happen within our group because um
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
I would be very hesitant to vote for any
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
changes um anything that would change
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
the current stat on conversion therapy
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
without hearing from more people who are
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
um who that would affect more
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
directly I think that then that sounds
 
00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
good to do that within our work
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
group and um anybody else have any input
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
and is there anybody that's opposed to
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
working towards clarifying the language
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
um within the existing intent of
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy not micophone oh not
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
opposed but I'm just not completely
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
convinced it's necessary there's other
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
part parts of this bill that needs much
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
more work or
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
nixing thank you my my thought is that
 
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
if there's any place here where we can
 
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
make treatment more clear and make a
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
more clear path with less conflict um
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
that that would benefit people
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
especially the mental health of people
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
who are going through this because the
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
more conflict that's in the media
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
conversion therapy is not allowed so
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's not clarifying a treatment that
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
isn't going I mean what's the point of
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
clarifying a treatment that's already
 
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.790 align:start position:0%
clarifying a treatment that's already
outlawed

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
outlawed
 
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
well the the problem we had heard about
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
some of the chilling impacts in a
 
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
previous hearing about conversion
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
therapy so I'm just trying to get before
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
it was Outlaw lawed
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
so so um we have tenative agreement to
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
look at some language representative
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I I would just like to be clear
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
for myself that that doesn't include um
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
for me approving the language that's in
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
this bill which I be completely opposed
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
to I I I don't I believe that we would
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
need to work through and basically make
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
it reflect the more clear language from
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
the W path guidelines and apply that
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
both to gender diversity and to um and
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
to sexual
 
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
orientation so that that is my so my
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
intention is for us to look at the
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
language of conversion therapy using the
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
more clear language provided by wath as
 
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to the language that's in the
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
statute in order to reduce confusion
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
around the existing statutes for
 
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.230 align:start position:0%
around the existing statutes for
conversion

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
therapy and everybody who wants to do
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%
that to try and clarify that language
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
looking to The Wack guidelines so let's
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
hands okay fantastic then we will work
 
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
to clarify that this is not a commitment
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
to supporting what comes out of that
 
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
work but it's a choice to look at moving
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
um assuming that we are willing to look
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
at any of the areas within the the um
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
gender care we would need to look at the
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
definition so I will I will wait to see
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
if we're going to look at those
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
definitions um right now do we have any
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
information about whether or not about
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
um if there is current ly um surgical
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
gender transitions offered to minors in
 
00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:36.710 align:start position:0%
gender transitions offered to minors in
New

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not that I know of because the
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
age of consent is 18 years or older and
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
so the uh any of the procedures as far
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
as physical procedures uh um um have to
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
18 what about the case where a parent
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
consents still still not if I think in
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
the state it's if there is parental
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
consent but also with a medical
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis that this is this is something
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done um there's very
 
00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
few cases where people where young
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
people have uh undergone surgery there
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
are some because there were medical
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
reasons for doing them uh and uh and it
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
was authorized by both
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
um Medical Professional and the parents
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
that this was necessary
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
care and was that um related to the um
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
the medical treatment of the gender
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
issues or was that medical treatment
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
related to something else I know that
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
we've heard about breast reductions from
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh girls from from people with people
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
who were having back problems and so
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
there was a reduction um in conjunction
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
with that when the gender identity also
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
um she they desired to not have their
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
breasts right um I believe that um that
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
there had been um representative not
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
upam I thought you would had you spoken
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
to any of the providers to get feedback
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
about whether or not there were surgical
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
procedures happening in New Hampshire
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
for minors um I
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
was I had and I was expecting some
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
information this morning and I
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
remembered that the head of Dartmouth
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
had spoke um on the day that we had the
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing said that no
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
transgender operations of children had
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
happened in New Hampshire under 18
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
breast reduction I view as something
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
else because um yes it could be done
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
because you're transitioning but also
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
I've had plenty of friends that were um
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
for bath problems or whatever had
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
reduction but they were probably over 18
 
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.070 align:start position:0%
reduction but they were probably over 18
so

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
um but I think we need to get hard facts
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth Hitchcock which is our
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
biggest provider because if people are
 
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
worried about 13-year-olds deciding to
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
change their gender I I think it's
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
happening um so that's that's why we
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
need the facts on this and I'm I'm sorry
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not better prepared okay um there's
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
also the question around the fact that
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
once you have a surgical procedure then
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
and sometimes there's a revision that's
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
required and then um a Cascade of
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
surgeries that happens it may not be
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
something that a child is able to
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
appropriately understand the
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
consequences of that first surgery so
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
that must be why very few of those if
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
any are ever done below 18 age of 18
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative kosman thank you madam
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
chair so would it be um appropriate for
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
us to since we need to find out if these
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
are happening in New Hampshire if this
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
is something that we are um looking into
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
to invite those entities to come and and
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
talk you know answer some questions
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
about that so we can find out exactly
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
what's happening here um yes I think
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
that even if we don't regardless of
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
where we want to go on this I think that
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's very important to get information
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
from the stakeholders to know whether or
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
not um surgical gender procedures are
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
happening to those under 18 in New
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think that that would be um
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
I think that that would be very very
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
important information for policym both
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
now and in the
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
future representative Hannan just a a
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
side comment as we're discussing this
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
because I I had my transition a little
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
over a year ago um the cost associated
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
with gender surgery procedures is
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
outrageous the cost of my surgery was
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
$96,000 um to do gender procedures
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
nowadays um oh even in the past on W
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
path um uh um requires uh therapists
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
psychologist um letters saying that
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
they've been seeing a patient for at
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
least a year and preferably two or more
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
um before they will off write a letter
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
that authorizes surgical
 
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
that authorizes surgical
procedures

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
um insurance
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
companies also require that information
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
before they will give an okay for them
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
so there are other things outside
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
of uh a child just a child and a parent
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
want to get a surgical procedure done
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's a financial thing that's
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
outrageously expensive where in the past
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
it had been like $20,000 and that was
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
that could be handled but now we're
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
talking $90,000 and above for simple
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
procedures uh so there's there's much
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
more that's sort of financial regulating
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
what's going on in this process
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
too that thank you for that in say
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's part part of the reason lasic is
 
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
so inexpensive is because it hasn't been
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance so I wonder I
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
wonder how much the uh insurance covered
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
inflation has hit those procedures I
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
know that um until 2015 they were not
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance but um under
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
Obamacare there was a ruling that it was
 
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
um discriminatory not to provide that
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
that coverage and then it's led to both
 
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
an increase in procedures and apparently
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
a very large increase in cost
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
Insight one more piece to add is
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
that when people are scheduling surgery
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
surgical procedures in this particular
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
area I know at least in uh in Boston
 
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
where I went um um it took me a year to
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
get a surgery
 
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
date and and I got uh I had interviews
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
with three different uh surgeons in the
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
process so just to make sure that I was
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
ready for for transition uh uh having
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
been who I am for 25 years uh it uh they
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
they said okay but they had to had to
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
get the approvals so so uh so yes
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
representative missor Siri thank you I
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
since you did bring up
 
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um I did recently speak
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
with a a a young woman she's 27 now but
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
that right before she was 18 she said
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
that she literally she skipped the whole
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
therapy process went right to the doctor
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
was put on hormones within 45 minutes
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
and then a a few years later if not even
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
sooner than that again no therapy went
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
right to the doctor had her breast
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
removed and so there
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
was in Massachusetts I know but so that
 
00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
that's I really want clarification too
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
from some local providers about what
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
what that looks like
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
here and and I understand the breast
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
reduction situation is somewhat outside
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's the genital area well and then what
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
her story is somewhat tragic because
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
because she started things at such an
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
early age it destroyed her internally so
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
she has since she's had all her
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
reproductive organs removed not not from
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
her choice um and so she's permanently
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
sterile and she's 27 and uh it's she's
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
been it's been a real challenge for her
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
so um and it just because she started
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
hormones at such an early age that it
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
just it she didn't go through the
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
puberty process so even if you looked at
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
her which she's I mean I welcome her to
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
come talk to you guys um she I she looks
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
like she's still 16 and she's almost 30
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
so she was
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
just her her process was definitely
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
subverted and she and she paid for it
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
with her internal reproductive organs
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
soorry could I clarify that so as a
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
consequence of the puberty blockers and
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
hormonal therapy um she had a
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
consequence of having um enough of a
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
issue with her reproductive system that
 
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
it needed to be surgically removed all
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
of it excuse me
 
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
um this is a a secondhand story not from
 
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
a medical professional um stating
 
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
consequences that that are not medically
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
stated by a medical professional so I'm
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
happy to have her come here and talk to
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
you I would prefer to hear from her
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
doctor than um so I don't you know we
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
can tell emotional stories that make us
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
for against these kinds of hearings but
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to stick to the facts and I'd
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
like to um if we're going to look at uh
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
outlawing surgery that's one thing
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
hormonal care is another thing not
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
allowing language in schools is a is a
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
third thing so let's not mix all of them
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
up together each time
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds fair um I the question
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
then would be um
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
whether I guess the biggest part is
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot that people follow
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
guidelines but it sounds like at least
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
in the state just to our South PE
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
doctors not following guidelines because
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
that treatment uh providing hormones
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
with uh that is not the only case that
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
we have heard of so it is quite possible
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
that doctors are not following
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines in other states and I've
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
heard similar from providers in other
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
states as well
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
um sorry representative kushman thank
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um the new
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
hampire gender diverse Care Coalition
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
has a website that has like a
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list of resources for
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
people seeking gender um affirming care
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
and they actually I know that the
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines you know um we just heard
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
that you have to be with a therapist for
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
a year or two and that they have to
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
write a letter um you know recommending
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
that surgery is appropriate for you um
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
but right at the top of this page it
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
says that within one to one to two
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
sessions these seven providers in
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
conquered and ones in Nashville
 
00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919 align:start position:0%
Portsmith a bunch of
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
um uh psychologists and social workers
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
will write those letters and it only
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
takes one to two um sessions so it it
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
look seems like it's practiced pretty
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
regularly that you can get the letters
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
of recommendation rather easily at least
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um at least that's what
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's saying to you know on this website
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
by this Coalition so um it is
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
worth probably making sure that those
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines are being followed that is
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
outside of the W path guidelines so
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
Perhaps Perhaps setting those baselines
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
of good clinical practice within the
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
laws if we have people that are if we
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
have providers that are advertising for
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
a care that is outside of the W path
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh might be an appropriate
 
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
move because um right now looking at the
 
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
relative groups the W PA seems to be
 
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
pushing forward um a lot further than
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
some of the other other peers so if they
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
advise caution I think that we would do
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
well to keep that caution Erica yeah
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
represent M uh I do thank you um for
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
letting me speak um I also think it's
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
important that yes we're talking about
 
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and what's happening here
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
in the United States but I would hope
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
we're also looking around the world to
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
see what other countries and other
 
00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:57.799 align:start position:0%
nations are doing right now and I mean
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
I I've been trying to do my research on
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
both sides of all of it and and looked
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
to Europe and there are several
 
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
countries in Europe right now Norway
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
Sweden Etc who have put an absolute
 
00:31:13.519 --> 00:31:15.190 align:start position:0%
Sweden Etc who have put an absolute
pause

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
pause
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
on all things related to miners
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
transitioning but especially surgery um
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
and you know I could walk you through
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
all the information that I found um you
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
know even in France and everything I'm
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
reading it right here um NHS
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
also they
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah they they just kind of put a
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
pause on all of it because of the real
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
St statistics that are starting to come
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
out um on how it's been affecting minors
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
so representative Canon um I hear you um
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
but I've also heard uh contradictory um
 
00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:57.789 align:start position:0%
but I've also heard uh contradictory um
information

00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh because some of the studies that were
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
used are out of date and aren't with
 
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
current current information so but I
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
think I feel that that's somewhat out of
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
the boundary here because we're we're
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
looking at at New Hampshire uh and
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
considering this and I guess what I want
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
part one of the things I do want to put
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
on the table is I think um that we may
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
be delving into too much detail that is
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
really a medical care information that
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
and should be handled by the medical
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
Statute because it will change as we as
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
people learn more about this and as as
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
do all things in the medical profession
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
as new treatments and so forth come out
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
so if we put things in in statute that
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
um uh impact the a medical the medical
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
organization to taking appropriate
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
action because we've put something in
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
place uh that may be the wrong thing to
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
do so but I I just want to flag that as
 
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
a potential issue okay uh thank you and
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
also the it's also possible to change
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
those laws if we do put them into place
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
as those clinical data and evidence
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
comes available um my question now would
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
then be about surgical um gender
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
transition procedures and given that uh
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
the guidelines say that you should spend
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
time with full hormonal treatment living
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
um as as your preferred gender
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
um and that prior to initiation of those
 
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
hormones there's also a multi-year
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
process uh in order to make sure that
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
that process is not short circuited and
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
that we are not providing um providing
 
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
we're not allowing surgeries to happen
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
that then will remove people's genitals
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
and reproductive organs in miners um
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
would we agree to work towards language
 
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
where genital where surgeries re
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
assignment surgeries and those under 18
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:06.669 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
yes um so I'm reading a letter that we
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
got um when they came to testify in
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
March and so
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
um occasionally babies are born um with
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
IND intersects or indistinguishable so
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
as long as there was some kind of a
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
clause that would allow families to deal
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
with however that gets treated I'm not
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
an expert on that by any means
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
um I I kind of agree that um transgender
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
surgery before 18 is inappropriate so
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um if you look on page six
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
135-20 um it's specifically allows um
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
interx or a failure of a treatment
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
performed elsewhere even failure of um
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
an illegal treatment to be dealt with
 
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.790 align:start position:0%
an illegal treatment to be dealt with
page

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
six um starting at line 12 is where it
 
00:35:08.109 --> 00:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
says what's not prohibited so 15 it says
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
it services to persons born with a
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
medically verifiable disorder of sex
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
development including a person with
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
external biological sex characteristics
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
that are ambiguous um and so then it has
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
some of the chromosomal anales and those
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
having both a very inter testicular
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
tissue um then Services provided when a
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
physician is out wise diagnosed a
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
disorder of sexual development that the
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
physician is determined through genetic
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
or biochemical testing that the person
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
does not have um normal biological
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
structures and then um also Beyond just
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
the interx issues it does say treatment
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
of any infection injury disease or
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
disorder that's been caused or
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by a trans transition
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
process whether it was legal or not um
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
can all be
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
treated so does that provide the
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
safeguards that you'd be worried about
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to look at the surgical
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
procedures I think so I'd like to hear
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
from my colleagues representative
 
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.950 align:start position:0%
from my colleagues representative
Sho

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
Sho
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what we're being asked
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
right now um whether we're in agreement
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
to talk about something and of course
 
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
I'm always willing to talk about
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
anything but um I don't really have an
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
interest in including something about
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
about this in a final statute and I I'll
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
um you know in the Preamble to this bill
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of um studies say this and
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
studies say that
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
or um there are no long-term
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
longitudinal studies um or there are
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
longitudinal studies that say that
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
there's or or we have anecdotal stories
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
um and it's not that I'm above using
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
this kind of language you know um
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatment science-based
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
treatment studies say this studies say
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
that um so I think the whole this whole
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
bill is skewed towards saying that we
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
have a major problem here and um I don't
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
think we do and
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't know the specific
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
answer although I just emailed to um the
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
person at Dartmouth Hitchcock um about
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
whether they' ever um whether they
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
ever um provide surgeries for people
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
under 18 um I'm I'm not sure of the
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
answer of that although I wouldn't be
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
um I I can't help I can't kind of
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
separate my feelings about working on
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
this bill from the context of seeing
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
um and I know you're trying very hard to
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
separate it from an attack on certain
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
people but I I'm having a hard time
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
separating it from an attack on um trans
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
people across the country and
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
um so I appre I really appreciate the
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
the introduction that you gave about all
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
the um all the ways in which um medical
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
institutions and Physicians have errored
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
um and have done real damage to people
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
have abused people um and I appreciate
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
that and I agreed with every one of
 
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.230 align:start position:0%
that and I agreed with every one of
those

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
examples I don't feel like this falls
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
into the same category and so I am not
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
really I would not be in support of
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
something that limits
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
um surgical procedures you know unless
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
someone came here from Dartmouth
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock and said yes we willy-nilly
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
um operate on on you know 14year olds
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know after they've been here for 45
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
minutes we agree to do that um then I
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
would change my mind um but I that's not
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
what I heard when people came to testify
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
at all I heard that people
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
um anyway so to clarify are you saying
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
that you believe that um gender
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgical procedures should
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
be permitted to happen in New Hampshire
 
00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:40.990 align:start position:0%
be permitted to happen in New Hampshire
two

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
minors I would say that any of these
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of treatments were at my child
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
would be incredibly worrisome to me and
 
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
I'd be incredibly concerned not just
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
surgery but puberty blockers or um
 
00:40:03.309 --> 00:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
hormone treatment um whether it was my
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
child as a minor or my child as an adult
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
I'd be incredibly concerned about the
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
medical consequences I'd be worried
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
about them um with all due respect I'd
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
love to hear your answer to her question
 
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
though the answer is
 
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
um the the answer
 
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
is I think that decision should be um
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
between a parent a child and the doctor
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh would you be willing to place into
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
statute that the parent unless their
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
parental rights have been removed um is
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
required to be a participant in the
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
decision around um gender
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
transition because you believe so
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
strongly that a parent should be part of
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
this discussion um that is actually
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
within the W path guidelines that the
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
parents should be involved in the
 
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
decision should be involved in the
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
process in the the therapy sessions not
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily the one-on-one therapy
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
sessions where the patient is speaking
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
with a appropriately trained provider
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
but also having family therapy
 
00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
treatments where as a family they can
 
00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:10.839 align:start position:0%
speak to the overall issues speak to the
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and risks and the the the the
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
clinical s sorry I I know as a doctor
 
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
you understand specifically what I'm
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
saying there but basically everything
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
that happens after you have an
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
intervention um so that there can be a
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
fully informed family decision as they
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
move forward with any any of the gender
 
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:33.990 align:start position:0%
move forward with any any of the gender
transition

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
care or would you be willing to explore
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
whether there's appropriate language
 
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
that would honor that relationship so
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
that those those children can be in a
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
supportive environment with parents who
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
can work with them towards a lifelong
 
00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:51.030 align:start position:0%
can work with them towards a lifelong
successful

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
life representative Canon
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
um I think I think I think there there's
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
another aspect about this that um I'm
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
struggling with um the number of
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
children that actually experience a
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria in our state is
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
extremely small the population is
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
estimated for the entire transgender
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire is estimated
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
to be 610 of 1% and so the the number of
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
children that are impacted is
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
substantially less than that and so
 
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're getting to the point where we're
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
going to be defining things as stat in
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
statute for an incredibly small portion
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
population this would be a targeted for
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
for the transgender community and then
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
it comes down to well there are other
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
medical procedures that are done to
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
children with other uh whether it's
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
diseases or other situations that are
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
defined by med that aren't in statute so
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
we're running into this thing where
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be putting Medical Care
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
things into to statute that don't exist
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
for other procedures that may in impact
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
the similar number of children across
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
the state so I'm I'm running into uh are
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
we doing the right things by putting
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
things into statute that are going to
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
impact a very small portion of the
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
population representative kushman thank
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
you um so if I may uh we're talking
 
00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.309 align:start position:0%
you um so if I may uh we're talking
about

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
procedures and treatments that
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
can result in permanent sterilization
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular risk
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
osteoporosis um lifelong issues that
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
will require lifelong treatment to deal
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
with and we're talking about anywhere
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
between uh the research that I've looked
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
at 10 and 30% desistance rate um after
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
these treatments and and surgeries and
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
though it's a small number um of the
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
children and of the entire state of New
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're talking about very very
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
serious um SQ ey and um a very kind of
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
new um a a new and explo exploding
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
rather fast um area of
 
00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
medicine and as these guidelines are
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
formed I think it's appropriate um for
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
us to we're not you know whenever
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
there's a new technology or new
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
innovation many times there's discussion
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
about moratorium um you know to a wait
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
and see and you know we need to
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
understand what's actually happening and
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
as far as legislating Medical Practice
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
um when there is this much risk involved
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
and the fact that uh um a child may
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
regret it and have lifelong um SQL eye
 
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
Medical squel Eye as a result we're
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
talking serious trauma um I think that
 
00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
it's a very appropriate place for the
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
state to step in we we require a
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
specific consent form for a woman to
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
receive to uh have a vaginal birth after
 
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:03.990 align:start position:0%
receive to uh have a vaginal birth after
a

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
cesarian so I this isn't outside of the
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
Wheelhouse of what the the New Hampshire
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislature has done when it comes to
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
procedures that could um potentially be
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
um very
 
00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:20.559 align:start position:0%
risky thank you a representative Moor
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um I just want to speak
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
back to something that representative
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
Shapiro said that
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
I've you know I when you talk about
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
things like this being and I've heard
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
this before an attack against a certain
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
Community I do think we have to be
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
careful about that because I don't
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's I don't that's not how I do my
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
life I don't go around attacking certain
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
groups of people this is specific to
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
minors so personally as an adult what
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
you do is your business live your life
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
the way you want to do it um I have many
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
friends in this community and they are
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
doing that but we are talking about
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
miners so that's the differentiation
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
between this being an attack on a
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
certain Community this broad Community
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
when many of us are just right now
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
wanting to just step up and say you know
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
what this is for the kids let let's let
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
them be kids for a little while longer
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
until they're adults and then can make
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
that decision so um thank you I'm
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
actually going to um refer to some of
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
what you brought up representative
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
Shapiro and then I'll recognize you
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
after um my motivation in pursuing this
 
00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.510 align:start position:0%
after um my motivation in pursuing this
isn't

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
to isn't to demonize any group or cause
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
any trouble for any groups um I as a
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
medical device analyst worked with many
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
emerging therapies um when we had drug
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
alluding stuns which are for um they're
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
actually not to prevent another heart
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
attack it opens up the blood vessels but
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
it makes it so you're not having that
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
chest pain that feels like heart attack
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
um they came out with drug eluding stems
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
so those had pet taxel or dosil taxel on
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
them and they started flaking off and
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
killing people so that was an adoption
 
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
where all of the clinical data all of
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
the clinical evidence showed that there
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
was going to be a benefit and it seemed
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
to be a minor risk it was broadly adapt
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
adopted and many many people died so
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
many that one pathologist had so many
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
patients through that she was able to
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
find the parts that had flaked off and
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
were found in people's brains
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
I as somebody who has involved in
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
medical technology and medical advances
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
for a large part of my career understand
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
that when we're in an early adoption
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
phase there's risks that are not known
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
and my motivation in actually coming
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
together and trying to figure out where
 
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
we can draw some good hard lines right
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
now is to protect children who may not
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
understand the way that medical new new
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
medical new medical findings end up
 
00:47:58.109 --> 00:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
changing over time time and also may not
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
understand just how lasting an impact
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
those procedures can have um quite
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
frankly I think that if we can at least
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
set some minimum guard rails around this
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
like pre preventing this surgical gender
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
reassignment procedures in minors we're
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot less discussion on
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
this and so there will be less of this
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
conversation where people will
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
incorrectly feel attacked by people who
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
are doing this out of a motivation to
 
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that um BAS Bally that there's
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
a time to pause and think before you
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
undertake a procedure that has been done
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
nor been done predominantly in an adult
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
sexually mature population and that when
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
you translate a surgery that's been done
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
in an adult sexually mature population
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
to um children to minors who have been
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
undergoing did not go through normal
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
puberty and did not go through the
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
normal physiological processes of that
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
and have been on other endogenous drugs
 
00:48:55.789 --> 00:48:55.799 align:start position:0%
that there are a risks that we will not
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
know until after these children grow up
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
and were able to see what happened um
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
right now you're looking to evidence in
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
adults and then extrapolating that to
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
children in any other field of medicine
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
children are not small
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
adults even adolescents even young
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
adults in some areas have an entirely
 
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
different treatment protocol than mature
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
adults so there are different guidelines
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
in some some specialty areas that are
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
under 16 and then 16 to 25 because
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
physiologically they are not the same as
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
an adult we know longer term data on
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
adults with these therapies we do not
 
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
know them with
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
children and to take the take the most
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
extreme part of this which is the gender
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
reassignment surgeries and minors off of
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
the table I think that there'll be a lot
 
00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:52.799 align:start position:0%
less of this discussion of this and
 
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
it'll bring a little bit more peace a
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more understanding and we can
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
start talking about how we're trying to
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that they aren't
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
early adopter that are harmed so
 
00:50:04.359 --> 00:50:05.910 align:start position:0%
early adopter that are harmed so
representative

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
um I would apologize for
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
extrapolating um my view of the national
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
situation um extrapolating that to this
 
00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:20.799 align:start position:0%
the people in this room and I apologize
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
for attributing motives to um the people
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
in this room thank you um to go back to
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
the earlier question about parental
 
00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:32.870 align:start position:0%
the earlier question about parental
consent

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
for gender affirming care in general or
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
um you know I've learned a long time ago
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
to that Hippa and consent are so
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
complicated that every time you think
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
you have it right you you don't have it
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
right but my sense um as some someone
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
who's been in you know in related
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
um a minor getting gender affirming care
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
or any other care who was going to have
 
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
a a medical procedure a surgical
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
procedure would need um parental
 
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
consent um meaning to be included in
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
decision-making and consent to actually
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
belief is that that is already being
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
done at the at the one place in New
 
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where this kind of care is
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
offered if I if I was to find out that
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
it was a problem that it wasn't um
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
happening then I would be open to the
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
having including that in Statute in some
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
way I think it's already covered but if
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
if I found out it wasn't covered um I
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
would agree that because I feel
 
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
like 14 year olds 17 year olds shouldn't
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
be having these kinds of surgeries
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
without the agreement of their physician
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
the the medical team their family um
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
being included in making that decision
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
together um thank you representative
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you madam chair um so on
 
00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:23.559 align:start position:0%
on all of this discussion um the what
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
keeps popping back into my mind is there
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
are currently guidelines and um so we
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
have some guidelines of the most forward
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and most well researching um
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
organizations it's a global organization
 
00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
that they've set forth and it includes
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
the consent piece it includes um the
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
surgery piece it includes you know
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
hormones and um you know uh kind of
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
eliminating extraneous variables um like
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
depression and trying carefully with
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
children with
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
um autism spectrum disorder um so we
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
have the guidelines and this is a new
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
and expanding rapidly expanding area of
 
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
medicine and um we're wanting to put
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
these guard rails in
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
place so it I would say that it's more
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate to put the guidelines in
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
place and then or at least propose them
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
and and then if there's something in the
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
specific guidelines that we propose that
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
does interfere with current practice by
 
00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
these organizations then they can then
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
um or or by you know any of the clinics
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
and and they don't agree with it then
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
they will have the opportunity to show
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
us exactly where and why and that will
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
help us in sorting out the fine details
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines thank you um and uh one of I
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
have another statement then I'll toss it
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
back over to you representative Shapiro
 
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
um you had also mentioned when you were
 
00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:04.799 align:start position:0%
speaking about the opportunity to be
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
involved when those earlier decisions
 
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
happen as well and in those guidelines
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
it does say that for hormonal treatment
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
um it's important to have parental
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
involvement too um the
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
question it sounds that representative
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
Shapiro that you are believe that at the
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
point of surgery the parent needs to be
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
part of that consent process
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
um how much earlier and with what kind
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
of side effects do you think that the
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
parent should be involved in the consent
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
process um when one of the known risks
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
may be um lifelong fertility issues
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
incre increased cardiac events um and
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
then especially increased depression
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
because some of these therapies
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
especially some of the hormonal
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
therapies have increased depression and
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
if a parent is in the dark they may not
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
understand that their child is now
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
because of their medication um more
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
likely to undergo a significant
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
depressive event um that could have life
 
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
ending consequences when do you think
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the parent needs should be part of
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
informed when my niece who's 38 now um
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
was a young child um she was incredibly
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
so the the the doctors suggested a
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
puberty blocker so she would have time
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
to be a more normal
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
height um you know she didn't have a
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
genetic problem that seemed to be
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
causing her to be short she was just
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
she's still really short um so she was
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
put on a puberty blocker um for I I
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
don't I I have no memory of how long it
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
was to see if she would grow a little
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
bit more she did grow a little bit more
 
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
but not very much and um and her parents
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
would you know there's no way that that
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
would have been done without her parents
 
00:56:05.069 --> 00:56:05.079 align:start position:0%
involvement and consent really probably
 
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
they made the decision I'm sure they
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
consulted with her but um so I would
 
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:10.910 align:start position:0%
consulted with her but um so I would
think

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
that any kind
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
of any kind of medical um care other
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
than the ones that are already kind of
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
separated for um privacy reasons like
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
like um STDs and um substance use
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
substance misuse care um where it's been
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
judged a long time ago that it would be
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
better to allow people to access this
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
with in privacy um any other care I
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
think should involve parental
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
consent and parental involvement thank
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
you we may have found a point of
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
agreement and if we can find agreement
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
out of this I think we're going to have
 
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
a huge win um um because you brought up
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
the the precocious puberty I think that
 
00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
that's actually an important part I have
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
some information to share with us on
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
that can um so yes representative I just
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
want to make one other comment that it's
 
00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:09.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
um I would I was wondering if
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
representative kushman was suggesting
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
that we um embed these um protocols or
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
these um guidelines into statute and um
 
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
would wonder if if if we ever thought
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
about doing that what would be the
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
repercussions of every time they change
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
their guidelines you have to change the
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
law or How would how we would even do
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
that that's a separate issue um so uh we
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
can take up that separate issue in a
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
moment so um treatment of central
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
precocious puberty which is when you're
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
going through puberty early usually is
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
done for height reasons um because if
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
you develop puberty too soon then you
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
stop um developing with height and so it
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
is um the central PR proser puberty um
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
it occurs in one to in 5,000 to 10,000
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
children mostly among girls and U mostly
 
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
on girls it's idiopathic they don't know
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
why it happened so normally when that's
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
done it can be initiated as young as six
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then it can be initiated it's almost
 
00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:17.799 align:start position:0%
always initiated before Tanner stage two
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
um and then it is ended they don't
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
really know exactly when to end it um
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
but there's not really any data that
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
shows that going past the bone age of 12
 
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
or 13 shows any benefit so um for the
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
most part it appears that clinical
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
practice ends um ends the the hormone
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
the the puberty blocking drugs before
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
the time that many children are going
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
through Tanner stage 2 which is when um
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
puberty blocking drugs are indicated for
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
um for gender related issues um which
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
actually really brings into question how
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
relying on the long-term safety and the
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences of puberty
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
blockers in central picosas puberty
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
relates to the use of uh puberty
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
blockers in gender issues so that's just
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
yet one another area where we're trying
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
to do the best we can with the science
 
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
we have but we need to make sure that
 
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
it's not oversold to these families
 
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
because this is hard for us and many of
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
us have medical backgrounds can you
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
imagine a parent when it just suddenly
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
suddenly there's a there's something
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
surprise you'd have to find someone a
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
lot smarter than me to respond to that
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
distinction um so if we can go back to
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
this idea of embedding some of the
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines in I think that if we can
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps find a floor of what should be
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
needs to be practiced in New Hampshire
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
um that we could look to some of those
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines we have many places where the
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
statutes do ref refer to guidelines or
 
00:59:51.789 --> 00:59:51.799 align:start position:0%
to um different protocols um in
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
administrative roles we have even more
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
of those and those chip typically are
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
updated every 10 years um there are a
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
few places where in law or in statute we
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
refer to Port sort of an evergreen um
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
Evergreen link to guidelines and
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
protocols um but that is very rare
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
especially because you don't know which
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
direction it's going to take and there
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
may be a need to change it before then
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
um in some of our building codes we
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
purposefully hold back on a new addition
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
of the building codes because the ch are
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
more beneficial to other regions than
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
they are to New Hampshire so the idea of
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
referring to a specific area makes sense
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the guidelines it's more
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
of an informational guideline where
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's the principles within the
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
standard of care 8 from wpath and they
 
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:42.039 align:start position:0%
basically have it where you would where
 
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
where if as a lawmaker were to implement
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
it some of it needs to be tuned to your
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
area because some places are using icd1
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
some aren't but having those principles
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
about which medical providers are able
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
to provide care um actually I think
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
would be very beneficial for everybody
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
because uh W paath requires that they
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
have specific training and specific um
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
ongoing training in gender issues and in
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
diagnoses of other mental uh in sorry in
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
in diagnoses of mental illnesses which
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
may have an impact or may present
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
similarly so that those can be ruled out
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
so that you make sure that you are
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
actually treating true gender gender
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
dysphoria gender diversity as opposed to
 
01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:32.839 align:start position:0%
mistreating um and illness or
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
mistreating something that um that
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
actually needs to be treated in a
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
different way so um I if we're willing
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
to look at these we can take a few
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
minutes and I can I can pull together
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
some of the language that we could pull
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
directly from the from W paath
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines in order to set some
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
requirements around that um do do we
 
01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
think that there should be a level at
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
which somebody needs to be trained in
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
order to provide medical care for um
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
transgender or gender questioning or
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
individuals representative
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
notam yes but I have
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
no idea of what I mean who would be our
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
guiding person to do you know what
 
01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.309 align:start position:0%
guiding person to do you know what
medical

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
Association or whatever would decide
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
what level of expertise what kind of
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
training would that that's a very
 
01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.190 align:start position:0%
training would that that's a very
difficult

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
question you know so if there if there
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
was a clear-cut set of definitions that
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
um we could look to an outside agency
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
Canon I think that might be an
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate question to ask um uh
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
someone from Dartmouth um is how do they
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
they judge that somebody's at a level
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
that they can provide services I do know
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
in my own speaking to audiences about
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
how to that the things that they should
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
be looking for the feedback was well we
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
don't feel qualified to provide that
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
service so in some ways they're self-
 
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
policing themselves saying I I'm not
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
going to take a patient because I don't
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
know how to care for them uh and and so
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing and and but then
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
there are others that have established
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
practices that Fe that um for for some
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
reason whether it's a an organization
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
are are deemed that they have the
 
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge and the ability to provide
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
that service
 
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.109 align:start position:0%
that service
um

01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
okay so that might be a question for our
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
friends at Dartmouth okay I think that
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
that might be a great question to find
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
out from them if we could have them here
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
um in a follow-up meeting so would we be
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
willing to look and so with that we'll
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
we'll take a look and try and see if we
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
can get some basic language that we can
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
ask them about um to be able to present
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
and say this is what we have from these
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines make sure that it's available
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and if there's a different
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
competing organization that is more
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
suited to determine who can provide
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
medical care and Medical Counseling that
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
um that that would be the next steps um
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
part of the concern is were there any
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
more comments on that
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
representative um I think I think
 
01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
hearing from people who are um
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
intimately involved in this kind of care
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
would be a good way to go about that
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
but are
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
there are there any other similar
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
um guidelines in statute about like what
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
specific care beyond what specific
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
certifications or what specific
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
experience or training that medical
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
providers have to have beyond the fact
 
01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
that they are uh
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
thoracic surgeon say to do a certain
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
kind of surgery are there other examples
 
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
of this in statute is my question there
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
are many examples in statute um of
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
different professionals who need to have
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
certain certifications in order to
 
01:05:12.589 --> 01:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
practice in a certain area I believe
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
that that is also the case in medical
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
professionals that's why we have so many
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
different areas and different SE
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
sections of lure um but I know for a
 
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
fact that in in other areas where where
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about uh the Integrity
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
of a person's body um we absolutely do
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
have those those specific certifications
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
in many other
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
fields that that
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
are that are separate from the parts of
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
Statute that list the scope of
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
practice I mean are there certain are
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
there certain
 
01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.829 align:start position:0%
there certain
like

01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
diagnostic groupings that are then
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
like there's not being very articulate
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
are there certain
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
diagnoses that are referred to in
 
01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:00.630 align:start position:0%
diagnoses that are referred to in
statute

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
and who can provide care for those
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
diagnoses in terms of their training
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
their experience their
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
certifications um if you look at that
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
that's part of why we have a breakdown
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
of some of the different Medical
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
Specialties the question is how granular
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
and in an area of
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
emerging an increased emerging area of
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
therapy uh making sure that only those
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
people who are qualified to provide Good
 
01:06:30.269 --> 01:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
Health Care would be beneficial to this
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
to especially a community that feels
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
that the world is against them to make
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
sure that only those healthcare
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
providers that truly do know the best
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
science would be I think one of the most
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
beneficial things that we could
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
do um perhaps you could refer me to like
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
a spe specific example involving some
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
other kind of care that this would be
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
parallel to I I'll see if there's
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
anything that's parallel to that
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
I quick question yeah just a quick
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
question so as of right
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
now Dartmouth is what I've been hearing
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
they they
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
are most likely not performing
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
transition surgeries on
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
minors as far as we know
 
01:07:16.029 --> 01:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
right so my question is regarding
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
why why we why why why aren't other
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
providers doing
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
this are are they allowed or are they
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
not allowed like do we have a statute in
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
place right now that prohibits them so
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
then why aren't they doing
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
it it's sort of managed within the
 
01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
medical field within the um it's it's
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
like there are only certain centers in
 
01:07:46.589 --> 01:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
the in the country that have transgender
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
Health units Dartmouth is one right um
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
down in Mass General and uh a number I I
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
know so those those have staff that are
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
trained right specifically for
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
transgender health so it sounds like
 
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.230 align:start position:0%
transgender health so it sounds like
Dartmouth

01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
does and are so yeah I really like to
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
know if this is happening there then i'
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
like to know that sooner than later
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
represent perel probably doesn't shed
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
very much light on the situation but I
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
just got an email from um Courtney
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
Tanner who's the one of the legislative
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
Lia zones for Dartmouth hitchcook and
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
her I to our surgical procedures related
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
to transition done at Dartmouth
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock on miners even if infrequently
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
and she wrote as a rule no like any
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
exceptions so okay that actually seems
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
even a little bit more concerning to me
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
do because um the one of the biggest
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
areas is there's a lot of areas where
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
you're not able to practice certain
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
surgeries unless you have a certain
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
volume um and even within different sub
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
different subgroups of patients but I'm
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
glad we have that information that gets
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
us a lot closer and um then for more
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
followup from Dartmouth I would like to
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
know what those exceptions are because
 
01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
um we we want to make sure that nobody
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
is denied appropriate care but we also
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that people are
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
protected um and especially
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
children um representative
 
01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
kushman than thank you madam chair um
 
01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding so from that same
 
01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.349 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding so from that same
um

01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
website I was talking about earlier um
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
there's also a list of surger surgeons
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
and one two of
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
them um do surgeries at Dartmouth
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock but there's a third that does
 
01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
them at Elliot um and then as far as
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
hormones um Planned Parenthood of
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
Manchester there's an MD in Portsmith
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
the lovering health center in Greenland
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%

Health Center and
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
conquered as well as the UNH Health and
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
Wellness Center um they also you know
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
they're also offering these um services
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
so uh we invite them to give us feedback
 
01:10:13.149 --> 01:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
on on whatever it is that we put forward
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
as uh the Baseline guidelines um for
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
this or I would like to U Madam chair
 
01:10:20.679 --> 01:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
this or I would like to U Madam chair
and

01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm just considering you know if if
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
they are not doing these surgeries on
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
minors then there should be no push back
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
of having that in statute and if there
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
does become a pressing need and the
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
evidence comes to show that it is much
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
beneficial contrary to what the evidence
 
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
is showing now we can bring that back
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
for they could bring a bill to change
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
that later just going back to the
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
concern about putting guidelines in stat
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
you um thank you that's uh very helpful
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
to know who is providing uh surgical
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
procedures in New Hampshire
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
um that so that list
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
was two hospitals surgical procedures
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
and all the other one were hormonal
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
hormonal yeah I just wanted to make that
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
clear because somebody listening in
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
might think oh all of those places are
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
doing surgery they're not thank you for
 
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.510 align:start position:0%
doing surgery they're not thank you for
that

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
clarification um so the safeguards for
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
the um gender affirming medical and
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%

transgender health for consultation and
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
referral is needed um I I think that one
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
of the biggest areas that we do need to
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps exercise some caution is that
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
some of what we're hearing from the
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
schools it sounds like they're actually
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
conducting medicine without a license
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
with some of the counseling that is
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
happening from teachers and others
 
01:12:43.149 --> 01:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
within because we are hearing statements
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
by some people who are on school boards
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
that basically say that they that the
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
people in the schools are those who are
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
best prepared to speak with children
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
around around sexuality and transgender
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
issues and having those discussions
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
especially within this whole context
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
about being able to identify um I
 
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
basically identify all the issues around
 
01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.310 align:start position:0%
basically identify all the issues around
it

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
that by giving free reign to have
 
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
discussions about these topics in school
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
and especially one-on-one discussions um
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
that this is actually quite possible
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
that somebody
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
may may be providing false information
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
misleading information or D ous
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
information when what they should be
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
doing is referring any of these uh
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
students with concerns to an appropriate
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
health professional who has the
 
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.709 align:start position:0%
health professional who has the
appropriate

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
training so is that this is one of the
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
areas where I think the fact that we
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
have some reference to the schools is
 
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.270 align:start position:0%
have some reference to the schools is
quite

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
quite
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
important so um we actually um we have a
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative prudo O'Brien actually
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
has some information about um about some
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
some of the statements that some school
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
board members um have made about the
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
appropriateness um about whether
 
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
children should be speaking to their
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
parents or should be speaking to people
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
in the schools um with their questions
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
around gender issues um I'm not sure if
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
you want us to speak a little bit more
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves or if this is
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
something that um you either wanted to
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
send me the information so I can read
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
the statement that was made or if you'd
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
like to share with
 
01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.590 align:start position:0%
like to share with
us

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
yes because I I'm very worried about the
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
potential practice of medicine within
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
the schools um when that really should
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
be happening with appropriately trained
 
01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.390 align:start position:0%
be happening with appropriately trained
medical

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
providers and well okay when when you do
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
have that then uh we'll need you to put
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
the light on so um sorry if I was uh if
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
I shifted gears a little bit quickly on
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
all of us there it just seemed very
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
relevant to the issue of healthc Care
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
Professionals being appropriately
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
trained um is there any push back on the
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
idea of making sure that people are
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
speaking to
 
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.629 align:start position:0%
speaking to
competent

01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
providers I didn't hear the question oh
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
just I I I I'm going to assume that
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
nobody has a problem with making sure
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
that people are speaking to competent
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
medical um providers when they have
 
01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.470 align:start position:0%
medical um providers when they have
questions

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
so just lost it I thank you for having
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
me I'm representative prud Brien from
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
Derry I wanted to be certain that I was
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
very accurate in what I say um a few
 
01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.390 align:start position:0%
very accurate in what I say um a few
weeks

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
ago someone sent this to me um because
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
they were worried about it
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
and I read about that uh this school
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
board member thinks that there should be
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
experts from outside of the community to
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
come in and speak to students about
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
gender issues be
 
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
because because they think it is not
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
acceptable for any parent to impose
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
their religious beliefs or in personal
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
ignorance and dictate the education of
 
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is a personal issue
 
01:16:13.229 --> 01:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
that parents do have the right to speak
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
to their children about um then the per
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
the Schoolboard member goes on to talk
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
about generational differences and
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's an that's that's an age issue so
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
if parents are
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
older than I don't know 40 or something
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't change the fact that
 
01:16:32.189 --> 01:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
they care about their children and they
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
have the right to talk to their children
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
about their deeply held beliefs I think
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
that if parents can talk to their
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
children about religion this is just as
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
personal and important to parents
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that's um thank you that's
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
what I have to add that's really helpful
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
so um in the reading it sounded like um
 
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
that they were saying that the parents
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
should not be involved in their in these
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
these discussions with their children
 
01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
but to leave it to the schools and that
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
parents of the older Generations are not
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
equipped to do so so I I don't think
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
that is accurate I think parents know
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
their children parents love their
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
children uh the overwhelming majority of
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
parents love their children very much
 
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
and want what is best for their children
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
and oh is there a question I mean does
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
anybody thank you
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify so someone on
 
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
the school board thought that parents
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
should not talk to their children about
 
01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.189 align:start position:0%
should not talk to their children about
specific

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
subjects but they need they need help
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
because of their ignorance and religious
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
beliefs and things like that I think we
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
have to worry where our society's going
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
if we're beginning to dictate through
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
laws what parents can talk to their
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
children about don't you yeah I think
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
that parents are equipped and and and
 
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
even if even if parents aren't so
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
equipped they're the parents I I agree
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
with you completely yes and when parents
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
do find an issue with their children
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
that is new to them they become equipped
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
I mean as a parent I mean anything when
 
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
when I became a parent the first thing I
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
did was learned all about breastfeeding
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
for example that thing thank you I think
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
we've actually may have found a point of
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
agreement the fact that we need to make
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure that parents are not cut out of
 
01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
sure that parents are not cut out of
these

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
discussions is that something we can all
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
agree on I I'm 73 and I think think I
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
should have the right to talk to my kids
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
about although I have to be very careful
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
to tell you the truth sometimes around
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
certain issues but good I think parents
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
should always Bravo I mean parents
 
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
should always be encouraged to engage
 
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
their children about all
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
issues thank you representative kushman
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and and then in that vein and
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know coming from that same
 
01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
um testimony that you've
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
provided a parent has you know more
 
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
stake in discussing these things with
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
their kids than a teacher who's not
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
trained on this so that's where the rub
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
is I think to insinuate that a teacher
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
who has no formal training on this and
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
is not a medical professional has more
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
of an ability and a and a right to
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
discuss these complex medical issues um
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
with a child and a parent so it it
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
really speaks to both requiring the
 
01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
competency and ensuring the parent
 
01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
involvement thank you very much I agree
 
01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
and my feeling on that is the same as
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
yours but even further I think
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
that even teachers I I applaud teachers
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
and the work that they do um but even
 
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:51.639 align:start position:0%
the the best ones are mere visitors for
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
a short period of time in our children's
 
01:19:57.149 --> 01:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
lives uh the parents are there for the
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
Long Haul the parents have been there
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
for the Long Haul they have watched
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
their children over a long period of
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
time and they will be there when the
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
children have problems in the
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
future and uh that's the difference
 
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
that's a big difference I I I myself got
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of help from from some wonderful
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
teachers when I was growing up and
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
social workers and I love them I think
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
of them as you know the very heroic
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
figures in my in my life
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
but sometimes I would stop and think
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
when I was when I was a teenager about
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
them that they were paid to be there
 
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
they were they were paid to be there
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
that was that was a little different
 
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
that was just a different perspective
 
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
than parents have thank you this is been
 
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
very very helpful I really appreciate
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
you bringing this so that we can
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
understand um some of those perspectives
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
from outside representative Canon thank
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you thank you for your your
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
comments greatly appreciated um I had
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
both of my daughters struggled in school
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
um depression and
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
anxiety and um it was brought to our
 
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
attention by the school that we might
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
want to seek out a therapeutic care for
 
01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
someone to investigate why and um just
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
just like in all procedures is what what
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
went on with the therapist that we
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
finally got um it was like like Las
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
Vegas whatever went on there stayed
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
there but the kids went back for
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
multiple sessions and they were fine and
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
you knew and you had the ability to help
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
your children because you were informed
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's very important to a point some of
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
some of what was discussed in those
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
things was between the child and the
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
therapist not with us directly but you
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
were able to address it like a
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
responsible parent because you had the
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
information that's I think we get to
 
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
that lat and think we if we can equip
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
our schools with the knowledge that if a
 
01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
teacher encounters a child that that
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
experiencing a gender dysphoric type
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
situation is that they it's it's above
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
their pay grade so they should be
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
referring it to somebody else who can
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
help thank
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
you that's I maybe maybe we can get
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
something really good out of this thank
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
you representative missor similar
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
testimony just happened at our school
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
board meeting recently where um a PA
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
professional and she spoke as a PA
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
professional at a Manchester Charter
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
School she' not she did not come
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
speaking as a private citizen which she
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
later said she did but she didn't it's
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
on video she spoke as a par professional
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
in a Manchester charter school and she
 
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
sat right at a table like that and said
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
I am
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
this and I work at a charter school in
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester and we are teaching gender
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
identity and sexuality information to
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
kindergarteners it is being done that
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
was her exact same words and then
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
wondered the next day why her school
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't under investigation because when
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
parents hear about this stuff it's
 
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
rightfully so you're going to be
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
concerned like wait a minute I didn't
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
know that was happening but then you
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
know then came up to the table a few
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
weeks later and was appalled at that her
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
schools now under investigation for that
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
on a private Schoolboard video so that's
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
why it is so important now that parents
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
are involved and we have an RSA in place
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
that makes it legally requires schools
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
to give parents notification two weeks
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
before anything like this is either put
 
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
on a whiteboard or taught in schools or
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
anything like parents have to be
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
involved that's all we're saying you
 
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
know is to keep parents in it to that
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
point point the Department of Education
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
recently put out a a memorandum on that
 
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
specific issue it's on the depart the
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Education
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
website uh Frank edelblute wrote a me a
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
memo regarding that to inform parents
 
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
that had questions about that wanted
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
more information so I want to mention
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
that for anyone watching yeah thank you
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you that was very
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
helpful thanks for bringing that insight
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
to us um I'm seeing that we have a
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
little bit less agreement around the
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
preventing um surgical transition
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
procedures for minors than I was hoping
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
we would have but I think that may be
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
something that we should try and work
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
forward with in a future um meeting to
 
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
try and get more information from
 
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and from any other providers
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
so we can understand what's happening um
 
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
I think we all have um is was it a
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
correct read that we all have an
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
understanding that um the teachers and
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
others within the school that are not
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
appropriately trained shouldn't be
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
counseling students on this but instead
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
should refer them to an appropriately
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
professional representatively on can I
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
just like point of clarity are are we
 
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
sure that we're like can we
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
maybe Reas the question maybe
 
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
of you know are are we all in agreement
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
that transition surgery for minors under
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
18 is should not be a thing um yeah let
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
me get let me get through this other
 
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
question around the um around teachers
 
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
and the discussion um there's there's
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
definitely an importance to make sure
 
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
that anybody who's discussing this is
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
well trained aware of the recent
 
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
evidence and is keeping up with with all
 
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
the advancements in this Dynamic field
 
01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
um do we have agreement that teachers
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
and other school professionals um should
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
not be counseling students on these
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
issues but rather making an a referral
 
01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
and notifying the parent unless there is
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
a reason um under existing statutes to
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
exclude the parent from that
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
notification through any of the DCF type
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
processes representative Shapiro yes um
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I'm not sure that I'm not
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
clear what
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
we I mean I know we're just making an
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
agreement to talk about it but I'm not
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
clear about exactly what we're making an
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
agreement to talk about like counseling
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
or curriculum or talking about gender at
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
all I think this is a slippery slope um
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to understand
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
the the so the question I was asking
 
01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:41.719 align:start position:0%
complication the complications um
 
01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
so so for example you know my
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
granddaughter has two mothers right so
 
01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.350 align:start position:0%
granddaughter has two mothers right so
um

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
some people might feel it's
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
damaging to um in the course of talking
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
to an elementary school class to refer
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
to families that have two same-sex
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
parents I I I don't begrudge them that
 
01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
they would feel very offended that their
 
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
child is being exposed to that well it
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
would be damaging to my grandchild to
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
not be exposed to that in school so I
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
think um I'm not sure if we're talking
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
about clinical treatment when we're
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
talking about like that the school
 
01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing clinical treatment or
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
what they should be talking about in the
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
course of um you know developing
 
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum or just general conversation
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
in the school but I
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
think in some states there have been
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
very um rigorous and I think harmful um
 
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
laws passed about what can be talked
 
01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
about in school and what cannot be
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
talked about in school and so I would
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
certainly not be in favor of being on
 
01:27:56.159 --> 01:27:57.310 align:start position:0%
certainly not be in favor of being on
that

01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
um so involved in that I had asked the
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
question about counseling so when
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
somebody comes and says that I'm not
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
sure about my gender that that then
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
would become counseling if you're
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
discussing intimate topics like that
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
there's a there's there's it would be a
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
separate discussion about the sexuality
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
and discussion of that in classroom type
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
um situations but right now I'm talking
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
about when a student comes and says I'm
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
not not comfortable I'm not comfortable
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
with who I am I think that I'm somebody
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
else is a teacher equipped to provide
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
the counseling that would then be
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
required and is that rise to the level
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
of having a appropriately trained
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
Medical Professional representative
 
01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.030 align:start position:0%
Medical Professional representative
Canon

01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
Canon
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
um I would agree with you that needs to
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
be a referral to someone that knows what
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
they're talking about um my concern
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
would be if there's a referral
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
it are we outing a child by referring
 
01:28:53.239 --> 01:28:54.189 align:start position:0%
it are we outing a child by referring
them

01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
for uh gender help or or or can we or is
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
there a way for a a recommendation to
 
01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
seek therapeutic help and let the the
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
therapist decide if they need to refer
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
them to another specialist
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
um because the the challenges in in
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
outing a child is where damage could
 
01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.510 align:start position:0%
outing a child is where damage could
occur

01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
occur
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
um especially if a parent is is doesn't
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
want to hear
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
it and I'm thank you that's uh
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
definitely one point I have also do have
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
a Counterpoint though that there is the
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
concern that when a child is undergoing
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
something that is this big and this
 
01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
complex if their parent doesn't
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
understand that there's something going
 
01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
on not even giving the opportunity for a
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
supported discussion to happen with the
 
01:29:49.109 --> 01:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
parent the the child may be so so
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about this that they're not
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
able to confide in a parent who would be
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
supportive and even a parent who may be
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
hesitant won't know to look for the
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
signs of a potential imminent
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
catastrophy and that harm and keeping
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
the parent out of the look out of the
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
loop could have also have severe
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
consequences representative Canon just a
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
continuation using the example of my
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
daughters I have no idea why they went
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
in to talk to a professional for their
 
01:30:19.709 --> 01:30:19.719 align:start position:0%
anxiety situation and they still at this
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
point when they're 40 and 30 6 years old
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
still won't discuss those discussions um
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
that went on with the therapist uh so we
 
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
we as parents never knew and still don't
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
know uh what what was uh the problem the
 
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
good news is they resolved
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
it uh and it didn't require our
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
assistance uh which may not be the case
 
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
it's in a transgender
 
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
child's uh situation however for a
 
01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.709 align:start position:0%
child's uh situation however for a
school

01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
or someone in the in the school to come
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
to a parent and say we need we think
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
that your child needs to see someone
 
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
who's who's uh knowledgeable about
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
gender dorer and and those things could
 
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
potentially be a problem for a child
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
who's already struggling themselves and
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
and as as we've seen is where a child
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
will take their own life because they
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
now don't feel uh they're getting uh the
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
home representative naram I I I think
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
the point that you're trying to make is
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
that teachers who are not trained in
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
counseling should not be counseling
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
correct and I would agree with that just
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
there's lots of well-meaning people that
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
have had some personal experiences
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
themselves that they think well I can
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
help them but you're right it's it's
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
above their pay grade and as um Jerry
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
said referral so and you know I'm sure
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.109 --> 01:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
um get getting close to kids and then
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
realizing well child will tell them
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
something and they need to refer them to
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
school guidance counselor or or law
 
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement or you know whatever it is
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
because they're mandated reporters and
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah representative kushman yeah
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
I I have to agree with you that and and
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
to your concern um it I think as long as
 
01:32:23.709 --> 01:32:23.719 align:start position:0%
you know it's a referral for counseling
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
they don't they should include the
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
parent but if there's some concern at
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
least it's a professional who's talking
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
to the child about it um and they might
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
not name the issue they just might say
 
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
you know we want to refer your child for
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
counseling because they're H showing
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
some anxiety issues or or you know
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
something and um it's beyond our scope
 
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
of you know Authority and and knowledge
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.270 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay I think we may actually have some
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
areas where we have some agreement um I
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
know that I need to use um the
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
facilities I don't know if we can uh
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
just uh take 15 minutes or do we want to
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
take 15 minutes or do we want to take
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
back it's
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
12:30 I have no food I'm not going to
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
make my wanted flock whatever
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
so okay whatever so we'll just take 15
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
minutes for the restroom maybe if we
 
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to just consolidate some thoughts
 
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
amongst our separate groups and just
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
consolidate some thoughts and figure out
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
our next steps yeah okay thank you so
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
we'll take a recess for 15 minutes until
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:52:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
1

01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you everybody and welcome
 
01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
back to the work session on House Bill
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
619 um as far as the guidelines and all
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
the other information um there are
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines on the w paath website it's
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
the S so8 um I can email that to
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
everybody on the subcommittee and
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
there's also the endocrine Society
 
01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
guidelines um since they've been dealing
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
with hormones and those treatments for a
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
long time I think that that would be
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
helpful for us also to review there are
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
some other societies as well if anybody
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
wants to share it but I I figure um I'd
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to look at any as we work on
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
our work going forward um I I I'm really
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
happy and really impressed with all the
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
areas where we found agreement today I
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
think that it shows how much we're all
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
looking to try and work together and try
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
and find the right Solutions and get
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
past this whole top level controversy um
 
01:53:22.750 --> 01:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
and actually look at the the best
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
well-being of of these children um so I
 
01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
actually I'm going to see if
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative kushman can sort of
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
summarize where we are um and uh and
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
figure that out from
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
there sure thank you madam chair um so
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
we had some agreement on um in on
 
01:53:47.069 --> 01:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
setting some guidelines for um the
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
actual medical care um pulling from the
 
01:53:52.109 --> 01:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
national organizations who have done the
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
most forward research on this um we also
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
came to some agreement about um ensuring
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
that there's parental participation as
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
much as possible um and we've
 
01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
discussed um redefining conversion
 
01:54:13.629 --> 01:54:13.639 align:start position:0%
therapy and we've also discussed um
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
agreement on establishing that um the
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate medical professionals are
 
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
providing counseling on this um to
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
minors and not those who are not
 
01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
trained um I believe that's everything
 
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
and as next steps and just uh with that
 
01:54:29.790 --> 01:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
yes I think that is everything and I do
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
want to clarify on the conversion
 
01:54:33.149 --> 01:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
therapy it's going would be going to
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
language that is more clear about not
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
coercing anybody so that we can make
 
01:54:39.629 --> 01:54:39.639 align:start position:0%
sure that the language doesn't cause
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
fear and confusion and a resistance to
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
therapy because right now I think
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of confusion about how
 
01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
that's interpreted so we would not be
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
looking to change the intent or change
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the conversion therapy
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
ban it would be simply to clarify it so
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
that we don't have people who are
 
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
worried and that that is causing
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
controversy and making this hit the news
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
media because it's not good for anybody
 
01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
to have this fight continuing to play
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
out in the news media so next steps um
 
01:55:13.629 --> 01:55:13.639 align:start position:0%
so as far as next steps um I I see us uh
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
bringing a draft forward and then having
 
01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
that available for all the entities in
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that it may impact and
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
giving them an opportunity if their
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
practice deviates from the best practice
 
01:55:30.589 --> 01:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
guidelines um that we would like to also
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
put in statute that they bring us um
 
01:55:35.149 --> 01:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
their policies and procedures and and
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
tell us where exactly it deviates and
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
what the evidence for that is and what
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
their outcomes have
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
been um and um that will give us an
 
01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity if there are myths we can
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
dispel them here in the committee that
 
01:55:53.069 --> 01:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
will help reduce that high level
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
controversy um that we're seeing in our
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
communities right now um that you know
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
some of these more egregious things that
 
01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
may be happening in other countries or
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
in other states that are not happening
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
here let's get that on record and if
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
they're not happening here then we can
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
we you know the guidelines will be in
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
place and make sure they won't happen
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
here in the future um so that's what I
 
01:56:16.109 --> 01:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
see as our next
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
steps do those uh General conceptual as
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
work for our next steps or are there
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
concerns on
 
01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
those and we we can summarize that and
 
01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
put that in writing so that we can uh
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
know our next steps and have that
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
written in an email um we aren't going
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
to have discussion um outside of the
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um but if there were any uh
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
any errors in what I do send out to
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
everybody as those next steps let me
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
know and then I can fix those if that's
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
based off of this conversation that's
 
01:56:49.709 --> 01:56:49.719 align:start position:0%
just a correction representative Shapiro
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify the next step would
 
01:56:55.149 --> 01:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
be to have another session of this
 
01:56:58.589 --> 01:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
committee and to invite some people who
 
01:57:02.069 --> 01:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
are involved in providing care um to
 
01:57:04.109 --> 01:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
participate in that yes we would
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
specifically be looking for testimony
 
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
from those who provide care or whose
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
organizations provide care with specific
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
feedback um on language that we can then
 
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
provide to them as we draft different
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
sections of this um so that they can
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
know what what we're going to be
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
discussing at that point and anybody
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
who's interested in any of that language
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
or any of that information can email me
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
and I can send that out um my
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
information is on the St State House web
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
web page um just so that we can make
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we do this as a committee um
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
we already heard about the overall
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
topics and we don't need to have um
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
another overall hearing situ uh
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
situation because we already know um all
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
of the people who are brave enough to
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
come and speak in front in public about
 
01:57:49.069 --> 01:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
the general topics what we need to do
 
01:57:51.149 --> 01:57:51.159 align:start position:0%
now always talk about what we can do so
 
01:57:54.069 --> 01:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
that we can stop having to have those
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
big larger larger conversations that may
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
not be as productive um just as a as a
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
as a whole society and work on focusing
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
on those areas of agreement to make sure
 
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
that we understand where care is in New
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um what guidelines if any we
 
01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
put into our statutes to make sure that
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everybody on both
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
sides feels comfortable about where the
 
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
state of of uh transgender and gender
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
diversity care is in New
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Shapiro so I
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
would just like to clarify for myself
 
01:58:29.709 --> 01:58:29.719 align:start position:0%
that um these four areas Medical Care
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines parent involvement
 
01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:33.629 align:start position:0%
guidelines parent involvement
appropriate

01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:33.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:58:33.639 --> 01:58:35.510 align:start position:0%
appropriate
medical

01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:58:38.109 --> 01:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
um having appropriate training to
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
provide certain um certain types of
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
treatment um I think we were talking
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
about counseling mostly
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
um re redefining using different
 
01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
um I I think for just for I just want to
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
speak for myself that for example in in
 
01:59:06.270 --> 01:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
terms of Parental
 
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
involvement no in terms of in terms of
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
the example that we were talking about
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
um before we left that um if a child
 
01:59:19.870 --> 01:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
um brings up some distress about their
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
gender or questions their gender um that
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know the teacher shouldn't like take
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
that on as their own counseling project
 
01:59:31.629 --> 01:59:31.639 align:start position:0%
that there should be a process in
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
schools for referral and um to a trained
 
01:59:38.669 --> 01:59:38.679 align:start position:0%
professional a competent
 
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
professional sometimes they're different
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trained incompetent um so I'm in
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
complete agreement with that but I just
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that that doesn't mean
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
I'm in I'm in agreement with with that I
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
think that this should be in statute and
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
that that we should proceed to to find
 
01:59:58.109 --> 01:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
wording to um amend this bill about that
 
02:00:01.229 --> 02:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
um so there's agreement about the basic
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
concept but I don't agree that this is
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
something that we should be taking up in
 
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
this committee or as a
 
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
legislature um thank you for that
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
opinion if we can get to where at least
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
you agree on what the words would be if
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
they were to be in law at least then we
 
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
can um we can get to that point about
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not it deserves to be in law
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
very will to talk about it but I just
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to be clear what I'm what I'm
 
02:00:28.069 --> 02:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
agreeing to that that makes sense and
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
thanks for helping us set our
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
expectations so that uh that nobody's
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
opinions are misconstrued um just just a
 
02:00:37.470 --> 02:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
quick comment on that having been on a
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
school board and dealing with school
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
policies um the the
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
challenge challenge for us we can put
 
02:00:47.950 --> 02:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
something in statute but the school
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
system May take that and do what they
 
02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
feel like in in addition to um so that
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
that that's a problem area just in
 
02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
general no matter what we say here in
 
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature to put on the school is
 
02:01:05.310 --> 02:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
that policies can be written locally
 
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
that get implemented locally and and
 
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's always been a problem a
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
challenge because even the N the New
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire School Board Association only
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
provides a draft for schools to use and
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
then they change it based on their local
 
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
needs thank you that's a that's great
 
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
input from a former School Board member
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much uh representative
 
02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
missor yeah thank you I I agree be and
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
it is often times too that you know and
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
I've watched it because I've been to a
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
lot of school board meetings lately is
 
02:01:39.629 --> 02:01:39.639 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing in place it just
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
like there's this big limbo land that
 
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
they're in and it actually causes more
 
02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
division when there's nothing to fall
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
back on that says hey
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
we need to they need to do this and
 
02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's it because when it's just a kind
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
of a free-for-all which I've been again
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
to a lot of meetings lately and it's
 
02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
been a challenge of of them not even
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
knowing what is in place and what's not
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
regarding things so I think the better
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
that we can do about putting something
 
02:02:09.629 --> 02:02:09.639 align:start position:0%
just to for them to look at and refer to
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
would be really
 
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you um I think that these
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
are great next steps I know that we all
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
have complex schedules so I will um in
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
query everybody offline so that we can I
 
02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
can again assemble my spreadsheet and
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
see where we can uh where we can fit our
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
meeting where that will all be available
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you all taking the time and
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
really being willing to dig into
 
02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
this what what is the deadline for us
 
02:02:37.229 --> 02:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
to vote to recommend something to the
 
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
our committee um we would need to vote
 
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
to recommend something prior to when we
 
02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
meet an executive session to vote on the
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
bills all of the bills need to be dealt
 
02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
with um by the 17th of November which is
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
effectively the 16th um I think the
 
02:02:53.229 --> 02:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
sooner that we're able to address this I
 
02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
think the better um but we do still have
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
a a bit a couple weeks within here and I
 
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
think our chairman was um was it only
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday was it the day before I think
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
it was Tuesday so days I've been here um
 
02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
was going to maybe try and schedule our
 
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
executive session for November six um
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about either
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
the 6th or the 13th um would give us a
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
little more
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
we constraints that we okay and with
 
02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
that it would be helpful to know sort of
 
02:03:27.069 --> 02:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
your general constraints through
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
probably the the 13th or 14th so that I
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
can then also help the chairman know
 
02:03:32.430 --> 02:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
when we'll be able to slot in our
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
executive session for all of our work so
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
um that that would be very helpful so
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
fantastic and thank you very much I
 
02:03:43.709 --> 02:03:43.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of you and I appreciate
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh I appreciate the opportunity to
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
actually get into the into the depth and
 
02:03:51.549 --> 02:03:51.559 align:start position:0%
and and importance of the
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:31.790 align:start position:0%

02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
that
