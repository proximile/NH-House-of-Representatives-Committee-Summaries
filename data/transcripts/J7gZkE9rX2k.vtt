00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
um it being 10 o'clock uh I'm going to
 
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
open the division three work session to
 
00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
discuss House Bill 49. uh this is a
 
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
basically a continuation of a
 
00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 align:start position:0%
conversation we began last Friday
 
00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 align:start position:0%
we we got a lot of progress done I think
 
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 align:start position:0%
but but we we didn't complete the
 
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
conversation so
 
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
um so this is an attempt to sort of go
 
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
back to HB 49 go back back to the
 
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that was offered by
 
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 align:start position:0%
by representative walner
 
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
and and before we broke huddle
 
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
I pointed out that I had two amendments
 
00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
and I named them
 
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to be able to discuss
 
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.610 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to be able to discuss
today

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.050 align:start position:0%
today
so

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
um there this is a very hot topic
 
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
is scheduled to close on one March and I
 
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
think today is the eighth
 
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
so so you can you can hear the clock
 
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
ticking I think
 
00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.670 align:start position:0%
ticking I think
um

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 align:start position:0%
if we don't do exactly what the Senate
 
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
did with sb1 when the full finance
 
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
committee gets it tomorrow
 
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh then we open up some questions about
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh whatever we do that's
 
00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.970 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh whatever we do that's
different

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
can get turned around through the house
 
00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
and back over the senate in time for
 
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
them to do their thing
 
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.509 align:start position:0%
them to do their thing
to

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 align:start position:0%
um to get it to the governor before
 
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
March 1st so so there's just there's
 
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
just authentic time pressure here now
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
now there is some good news uh on that
 
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
front so it's not it's not complete
 
00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
Panic we we uh the speaker we the
 
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
speaker uh have been talking to
 
00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
um Senator Bradley and Senator Carson uh
 
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
about sb1
 
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
they are aware that we may not be in a
 
00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
position we maybe we are but we may not
 
00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 align:start position:0%
be in a position to send them sb1
 
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
approved by the house
 
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and and so
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
um Senator Bradley when I spoke to him
 
00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
this morning is anticipating kind of I
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call it the worst case scenario
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
but it would it would be it would be not
 
00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
the best case scenario for the Senate
 
00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
they would have to receive something
 
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 align:start position:0%
from us
 
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh and that they would have to uh
 
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
dispose of it rapidly uh and favorably
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
in order to get it to the governor on
 
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
time to forestall the one March closure
 
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
date it's there seems to be a path to
 
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
success though that's the good news and
 
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
I think as long as we
 
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 align:start position:0%
do the best we can
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
to re respect the fact that they've
 
00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 align:start position:0%
voted 24 to nothing for sb1
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
that's pretty it's a pretty strong vote
 
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
if we can respect some of what that work
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
accomplishment was
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I I I I think the state can be in a
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
really good place for taking care of
 
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
this this situation
 
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.189 align:start position:0%
this this situation
so

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:07.850 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of my introduction to to
 
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
where we're at uh I understand that uh
 
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren is not going to
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
be able to be in the room with us but
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
that she's watching uh live
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
um could somebody confirm or I could I
 
00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 align:start position:0%
would like to to to one of our
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
conversations representative Wallner I
 
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that when we go around
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
and we talk about things even though
 
00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 align:start position:0%
that she's not here if she were to be
 
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
talking to somebody I just don't want to
 
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
um do you know does anyone have comms
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm not going to ask you to do that
 
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
because that would probably create all
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
kinds of precedent and violation issues
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
with the house rules and I don't want to
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
do that but if if if the Democrat Caucus
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
was comfortable that we were not leaving
 
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
anyone behind as we went forward that
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
would be that would be good
 
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.810 align:start position:0%
would be that would be good
okay

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
okay
super

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.129 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
okay so so to take us to the next step I
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
think I said you know we are working on
 
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
House Bill 49. the amendment that
 
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner gave to us last
 
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
week is a is a an amendment to house
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
bill 49. what
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
um we will be looking at sb1 in full
 
00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 align:start position:0%
Finance tomorrow and it's going to be
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
coming to us as a division three work
 
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
session later tomorrow
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
so what we say on today on House Bill 49
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
and the amendment I view it as the dress
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
rehearsal for what we're going to end up
 
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
doing with sb1 because it's clear from
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
Communications with the Senate that the
 
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle they want us to send them back
 
00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 align:start position:0%
is sb1 it's easier for them to deal with
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
so so so you know I'm sorry for the
 
00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
confusion what we are talking about HB
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
49 formally and officially but but this
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
is really to help us get rapidly to a
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
resolution tomorrow when sb1 becomes a
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
work session product for division three
 
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.110 align:start position:0%
work session product for division three
um

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
now just just to clean up one stray
 
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.610 align:start position:0%
now just just to clean up one stray
thought

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
is that on the assumption that some of
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
the excellent work that's in sb1 uh gets
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
onto The Cutting Room floor to use the
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
film analogy all of those issues can be
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
considered and potentially incorporated
 
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
into House Bill 2 with a house bill one
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount allocated to to support
 
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:08.300 align:start position:0%
what we put into house bill too so so so
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
even even those things that we don't
 
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
keep an sb1 are not dead they're not
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
dead letters because we're gonna we're
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
obviously days away from having the
 
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and so we'll continue
 
00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
to talk about about it so those those
 
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
issues are not dead the the the
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
um I think the issue is that we're we're
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
trying to use the metaphor less is more
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
we we want to we want to keep something
 
00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
kind of tight uh that really represents
 
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh what's critical given the one March
 
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.829 align:start position:0%
uh what's critical given the one March
deadline

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:51.860 align:start position:0%
and I would ask us to apply our judgment
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
so that we maybe include enough stuff to
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
sweeten the pot for the Senate to
 
00:08:59.170 --> 00:08:59.180 align:start position:0%
increase the propensity of them
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
concurring with our changes it's totally
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
a subjective thing that's independent
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
thinking on all your parts
 
00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:09.769 align:start position:0%
thinking on all your parts
so

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
um so with with that I I can I can go
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
back to zero three one one which is the
 
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
walner amendment that we talked about
 
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
last Friday
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am I just have a little technical
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
question I'm trying to pull up sb1 so I
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
can just have it on my laptop and
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
perhaps Mr Ripple can help me the um
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
I have I'm in the docket it says as
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate and as amended by
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate second version I don't see
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
anything as passed by the Senate can you
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
just verify which one I should be
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
second thank you I apologize for the
 
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.290 align:start position:0%
second thank you I apologize for the
interruption

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
interruption
 
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
that's a good question uh and and it's
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
the second version they got uh past 24
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
to nothing and uh and and we'll end up
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
talking about a couple of key things
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
that was done uh in that in order to get
 
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:13.019 align:start position:0%
the unanimity of uh support for it so
 
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
um so so representative walner because
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're gonna
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
open today's in-depth discussions with
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
your Amendment do you I I know that
 
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.550 align:start position:0%
your Amendment do you I I know that
you're

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
busy but but I wanna I wanna respect
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
your ability to say what you want about
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
you got a button
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
when we left here I thought
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
I did not read draft this amendment I
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
saw this as sort of a working Amendment
 
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh because as we talked about it there
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
were other things that came up
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
particularly uh Mr ripson talked about
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
needing some funds to get to the end of
 
00:10:59.690 --> 00:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
June some additional funds so that
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the original Amendment so the
 
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
amendment is pretty straightforward it
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
um would move the closing date to June
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
we'd move it to June 30 2025 and I just
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
grabbed that as a
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
time I didn't know how long it would
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
really actually take to finish the
 
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.630 align:start position:0%
really actually take to finish the
construction

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and it appropriated
 
00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:37.579 align:start position:0%
two million dollars for site evaluation
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
architectural cons consultation and
 
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:42.980 align:start position:0%
development of a design
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
not included in that but we talked about
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
it was needing 100 1.5 million for
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
operating funds to get them through to
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
June 30th
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
so okay so everything you said I is
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
accurate in my view and and just to kind
 
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
of make the point this is going to be a
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
working conversation with the idea that
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
when we're done uh we'll have given Mr
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
Ripple more than enough notes to go work
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
with OLS to come up with a a draft or
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
excuse me a um an amendment for us and
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
that when we come back in our working
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
session tomorrow with with hope and luck
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
and all good speed we should have an
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
I I I'm gonna ask him to go ahead and
 
00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459 align:start position:0%
have an identical copy
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
readied for sb1
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
so that when we get into our work
 
00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:53.329 align:start position:0%
so that when we get into our work
session

00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
we'll have talked about all of this
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
stuff today there'll be no surprises but
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
if we like what we've done
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're in a position to immediately act
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
on sb1 as it's been assigned to us by
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
the by the by the chair representative
 
00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:14.509 align:start position:0%
the by the by the chair representative
Weiler

00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
is that confusing or is that clear if if
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
the if the division three members
 
00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
understand what we're doing then I
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
um to two line seven
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple and and everyone on a zero
 
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
three one one the walner amendment I'll
 
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
just call it the walner amendment from
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
now on
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
um this is uh down to line 12 an
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation of two million dollars for
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
them to go do site evaluation
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
architectural Consulting and design
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
development design options for the
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
replacement Center one of the things we
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
talked about last week that I think this
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph needs to have included in it
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
is some language to
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
direct Das to give us two distinct
 
00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:15.850 align:start position:0%
direct Das to give us two distinct
options

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:15.860 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
and and the and the and right now it's
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
just implying that there's going to be
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
one option for the most part but we need
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
two distinct options one option would be
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh this a six to twelve
 
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.150 align:start position:0%
uh this a six to twelve
range

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
and uh in in brainstorming this
 
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
yesterday with representative hole there
 
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
was a possibility he might try to his
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
shot at writing some language in that
 
00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
regard did you do that representative
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I did not I spoke with Mr
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
Ripple and asked that we work out
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
something for language but to take each
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
whatever Amendment 0311 which is
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
just referred to as the walner amendment
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
and add in
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
the necessary costs to continue
 
00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:09.899 align:start position:0%
operation of the sununu center
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
um through the balance of this budget
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
cycle knowing that hb2 and hb1 one step
 
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
at a time I know right now we're just
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
talking about the design money and we'll
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
get we'll get to the operations money
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
we'll do that so I have asked that Mr
 
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
Ripple craft something and we'll figure
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
out how to make that such that after the
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
design phase or the conceptual design
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
phase but before the detailed design
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
phase that there is some review back
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
with either fiscal or House and Senate
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
Finance combined not sure how to make
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
that process work yes so so based on
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
that feedback Miss Ripple do you think
 
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
that you have enough information to
 
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
create an enlightened addition to this
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph so that we're getting the two
 
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
I think so I think I would just need to
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
know exactly which committees you want
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
the two designs to go to and whether you
 
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
want those committees to
 
00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
review the designs or approve one of the
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
two designs
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question and I I
 
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
have my answer to that
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I I'm going to ask representative
 
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
Weiler if uh if if if if if he'll if
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
he'll listen in on this and give it his
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
input I I I think that we wanted to
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
um at least go back to the Joint
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
I would think that we would want the
 
00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
joint legislative fiscal committee to
 
00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:41.590 align:start position:0%
joint legislative fiscal committee to
exercise

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
the authority to approve or disapprove
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the design because there may be the
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
release of additional money to begin the
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
build part of the construction
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
I would want as a courtesy to give HHS
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
oversight a copy of the committee of
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
that report I would also think children
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
and family law should I I just don't
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
know how detailed to get into this
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
whether we should just be giving it to
 
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
the speaker into the Senate and the
 
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
governor and just and not worry about
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
distribution Beyond The Joint
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee I I'll take
 
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:21.909 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee I I'll take
guidance

00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
my view is we're two years behind
 
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
because of what happened
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
in the last budget and we didn't go
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
ahead and do anything
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
and what we're seeing from the director
 
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
is a continuing decrease in population
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
and we heard from uh representative Kirk
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
who's also given this quite a bit of
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
attention that yes
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
likelihood is that it will be a smaller
 
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:52.100 align:start position:0%
building than what some of these things
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
and the most important thing is that we
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
change the March first deadline that's
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
all that's important all the rest of
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
this I think we're moving too fast and
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
I'm not ready to to start designing a
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
new building until we get some idea
 
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
we're already as I said we're two years
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
behind so we're we're way behind on
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
where we should be and and I think
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
you're trying to make it move a little
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
faster but I'm not sure we're ready for
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion that we should try to
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
see if the if the forecast is that the
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
population will continue to shrink we
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
may need to look at it for a couple of
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
years and see is that is that the
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
instance or
 
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
do we need more so I'm not so sure we
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
know what to do with it representative
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
um well I'm kind of the new guy uh here
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
and then in in this process and didn't
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh struggle through the the last
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
budgetary cycle I've been kind of
 
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:53.900 align:start position:0%
listening uh to some of the preliminary
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh information meetings we've had and
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
um uh you know my my initial reaction uh
 
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.870 align:start position:0%
um uh you know my my initial reaction uh
was

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
um you know you know first of all New
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire relies heavily on contractors
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
we talked about our four 400 contractors
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
and we have extensive processes to
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
assure quality and efficiency using that
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a mechanism unlike most states
 
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539 align:start position:0%
in the area and
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
um you know applying my kind of my
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
general uh
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
um business background and listen
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
listening uh to what I heard here
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
um you know we had
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know somewhat relieved we only had
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
15 job attrition in the last last few
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
months we have 60 percent uh vacancies
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh in jobs I guess 28 out of 45
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
positions and uh trying to make a major
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
major decision about
 
00:19:50.409 --> 00:19:50.419 align:start position:0%
um you know what kind of a replacement
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
Center uh there could be uh I know in in
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
you know when when a brand name or or
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
certain type of service gets a bad
 
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
reputation it can be really really
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
difficult uh to turn it around
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
um and you know could take 20 years and
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
one slip up and we're back where we are
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
again because of what's happened in this
 
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
case uh here so
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
um uh and you know I I was quite taken
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
by uh representative Kirk's comments and
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
as uh chairman Weiler just mentioned
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
that um uh uh you know I'm in line to
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
take a deep breath but even I even think
 
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:34.220 align:start position:0%
we should go back and consider
 
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
the idea of you know the make make
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
versus build model of whether we could
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
do a better job for these kids and for
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers perhaps Contracting out
 
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
these Services rather than even building
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
a new facility let alone designing it
 
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:51.620 align:start position:0%
and coming up with the ideal size
 
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
again you know this this is just mine
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
coming in uh you know as a totally
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
totally New Perspective on this only
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
only really following this in the last
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that I I think you
 
00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419 align:start position:0%
opened up a a second issue beyond what I
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
was trying to get us to focus on which
 
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
is just simply
 
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.169 align:start position:0%
is just simply
um

00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
if we go and ask for design
 
00:21:21.419 --> 00:21:22.930 align:start position:0%
if we go and ask for design
recommendations

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:22.940 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
who should review them and approve them
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
and and and and I and I still think
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
I I agree with what is in the Wallner
 
00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:36.539 align:start position:0%
um the Assumption that's built into the
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
Wallner amendment that we should go
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
ahead and appropriate some money now for
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
these designs to begin because as what
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
was mentioned we've already kind of
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
wasted two years
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
and to pick up on the vacancy issue
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
we're already having trouble recruiting
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
and retaining uh and and I think we're
 
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
just in a situation
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
where I'm starting to fear an employee
 
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
collapse of the system if we if we can't
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
if we can't
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
start doing something on offense and if
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
we continue to look as though the
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
legislature is never going to get around
 
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
to solving this decades-old problem I'm
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
just concerned
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
that we're going to break the break what
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
we got completely and and what we'd
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
really like to do is we'd like to have
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
them start implementing this therapeutic
 
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
them start implementing this therapeutic
model

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
we we had testimony last week that as
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
much as the department would like to
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
implement the therapeutic model that
 
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
children and family law has said
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
repeatedly over the terms is essential
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
to the future of how we take care of
 
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
these kids
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
that we we just can't do it unless we
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
stabilize our employment situation and
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
we give the department the the room to
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
breathe to hire and start training and
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
retraining the their people to begin the
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
new approaches and so so my fear if we
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
if we don't
 
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:24.140 align:start position:0%
signal that we're going to move forward
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
it just it's just going to keep hurting
 
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
these kids I think we're hurting kids at
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Waller what do you what
 
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
what do you think this is your Amendment
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
and you've got the appropriation of 2
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
well I think that we're getting close to
 
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
when we're going to see the budget
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
next week we're going to have the budget
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
and we're going to start the budget
 
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.770 align:start position:0%
and we're going to start the budget
process

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
really historically I think that the way
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
this would be dealt with what it does
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
have I mean the Senate Bill won not
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
not 49 but Senate Bill won
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
um does have a fairly large
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
appropriation in it It's Not Unusual for
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
the finance committee to
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
um hold money bills and as and you do
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
them as we're doing the budget
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
and to me at this point I have to say I
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Weiler that
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
maybe we hold on here
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
put the date out and make sure that
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
people understand that it's not not
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to close immediately I mean it's
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
not going to close on March 1st and we
 
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.730 align:start position:0%
not going to close on March 1st and we
um

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
take a look a real
 
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
hard look at this during the budget
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
process and see how much needs to be
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
appropriated some
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
this was my Amendment from last week was
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
strictly a draft of a work you know some
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
I think it was brilliant though and I
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
preferred it to where we are right now
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
so uh representative hole did you do you
 
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
have comments or thoughts on this I do
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
pushing out the deadline by although
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
it's to whatever two years plus from now
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
right pushes it into the next into this
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
budget cycle at a minimum
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
effectively the house will have a budget
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
in less than seven weeks or our side of
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
it so if we've moved it out and funded
 
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
operations through the balance of this
 
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.549 align:start position:0%
operations through the balance of this
biennium

00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
um the law the potential loss of
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
personnel is addressed we know we have
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
to fund this anyway in a budget
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing that working
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
concurrently on that so A simple
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
amendment that just funds operations
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
through the end of the year
 
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
um at the 1.5 or 1.6 requested by the
 
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.230 align:start position:0%
um at the 1.5 or 1.6 requested by the
department

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
um gets us there
 
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
and that may not be what the Senate is
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
interested in but at least it eliminates
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand which is closure
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
whatever three and a half weeks from now
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what everybody is is
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
thinking about and gives us time to do
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
due diligence on this because it is a
 
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
different legislature there are some
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
different views on how many people
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
should be the facility should be planned
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
for and what is the appropriate
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
um policies regarding incarceration
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
versus training versus whatever
 
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
so so I'm I'm trying to chunk this out
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm still just dealing with the
 
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
Chunk on line seven through twelve on
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
the appropriation of the two million
 
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
dollars what I'm hearing is a sense of
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
the committee that we don't really want
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
to do that we want to go ahead and pull
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
out appropriation out and and and not
 
00:26:54.409 --> 00:26:54.419 align:start position:0%
direct the site evaluation and design to
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
begin after all because we think we can
 
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
do this in hb2 when we've not been able
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
to do it in the last five attempts but
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
somehow in the calm
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
non-pressure of the hb2 process we're
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
going to finally achieve resolution of
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
something that's been lost to us for a
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
decade that that's what I hear the sense
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
um and I I will defer the cumulative guy
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
experience here certainly outweighs mine
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't that does not feel like a
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
good plan to me I I would like to
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
advocate for us to keep this
 
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
appropriation in there for uh to go
 
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:42.740 align:start position:0%
ahead and initiate the design
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
under two models kind of a small model a
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
middle model and so that so that when we
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
come back in January we actually have
 
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
some information that we keep saying we
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't have so I I I that that's what I'd
 
00:28:05.289 --> 00:28:05.299 align:start position:0%
like to do so so so I think I we agree
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
that that the first part of the walner
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
amendment to kick this out all the way
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
through the next fiscal year the closing
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
of the next fiscal year is the right
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
thing to do we all agree on that is
 
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
there anyone who disagrees with kicking
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
it out to the end of the next fiscal
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
year no what I wanted to talk about the
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
name of it Escapes Me Now Keith and I
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
were discussing it a program starting
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
with the younger kids
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
that perhaps prevents them from getting
 
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
into trouble when they get to be 14 15
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
16. we start with the 11 12 13 years old
 
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.350 align:start position:0%
16. we start with the 11 12 13 years old
maybe

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
what's the name of it system of care
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay come on up uh and if you can also
 
00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
be prepared to tell us the numbers that
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
you do have
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
um because I think that was one of your
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
homework assignments I mean it's almost
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
too soon to see the results of that
 
00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:03.539 align:start position:0%
program but if that program has the
 
00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
capacity to reduce this population then
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with that
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody Joe ripsom
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
director dcyf good to see everyone
 
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
um so where would you like me to start
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
with the budget numbers or with let's
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
address representative Weiler's issue uh
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
about the system of care uh giving the
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
system to restate it I think the the
 
00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:30.220 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:30.710 align:start position:0%
question is
[Music]

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.789 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
do we do we believe that if we can as we
 
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
continue to mature and develop the
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
system of care model that that system of
 
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:43.460 align:start position:0%
care model with the earlier
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
community-based interventions do we
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
believe that will have a positive impact
 
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:52.820 align:start position:0%
on reducing the potential
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
detainee and committed populations in
 
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.470 align:start position:0%
detainee and committed populations in
sununo

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
sununo
 
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
the the Democratic demographics we've
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
seen for three years is pretty steady at
 
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
ranging from 12 to 18.
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
just just system of care do we have hope
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
that the system of care changes will
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
will drop that number further yep so the
 
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
data that I passed around I know the
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
first sheet looks familiar there's two
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
sheets in this that are not familiar to
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
you that start to tell this story so and
 
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
starts to answer the question of that
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
yes the system of care is one already
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
having an impact and yes I do think it's
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
going to have a longer term impact all
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
we are already I'll repeat already the
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
lowest combined rate of detention and
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
commitment in the country there is no
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
precedent anywhere else in the nation
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
for having a lower level than we
 
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
currently have right so the idea that
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
three years of study data is going to
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
change in the next two years I'm a
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
little skeptical about right I think we
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
actually have a pretty good data set to
 
00:30:59.330 --> 00:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
make decisions on that being said I do
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
hope that what we're seeing right now is
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
the system of care having its impact on
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
the older youth to the extent that it
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
can when the system of care really
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
starts churning that's when it starts
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
getting those 10 and 11 year olds today
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
that don't turn into the 16 and 7 year
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
olds 16 17 year olds that show up in
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
you're talking another seven ten years
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
down the road you might see the need
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
drop by another number of kids but I
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't think you're going to eliminate
 
00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
the need for a secured facility so let
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
me walk folks through this data just to
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
kind of explain what we're seeing in the
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
system I'm going to ask a clarification
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
and and a data check last week I think
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
he showed up saying that we were second
 
00:31:39.889 --> 00:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
best in the nation today you were your
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
second best test second best detention
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
we are behind Maine who claims to have
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
zero detained kids which I'm skeptical
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
about they do have a program they call
 
00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
shock incarceration which I think is
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
just another word for detention but it
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
makes them categorize it as commitment
 
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
which would make us number one attention
 
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
we are second best in commitment behind
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
Connecticut when you add up
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut's two numbers and means two
 
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
numbers we are lowest overall so the
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
lowest combined rate of detention and
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
commitment is what I would say but if
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're measuring them as individual
 
00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:11.299 align:start position:0%
we're second to Maine
 
00:32:15.169 --> 00:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
okay so that's really good yes and then
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
to the other point I think you
 
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:21.620 align:start position:0%
qualitatively suggested that we could
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
have an improvement still
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
with system of care matures
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
but but I kind of need a number if we're
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
if we're if we've been ranging between
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
12 to 18 what's your professional
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
judgment telling us are we 10 to 12 are
 
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
we where do you think this is going
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
because because we're being asked to
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
look into the future in a crystal ball
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
what's your crystal ball telling you
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's really really hard for me to tell
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
you that right and then there's other
 
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
variables that we don't have right now
 
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
that we don't know right you could have
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
major changes in our demographics that
 
00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
that change you know what what we see in
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
terms of crime and criminal Behavior you
 
00:33:03.409 --> 00:33:03.419 align:start position:0%
could have
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
rapid you know increases in in different
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
type of criminal and gang activities
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
that we don't currently see much of
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire right so
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
there's other Dynamics Beyond just this
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
that could happen into the future that
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
could change some of this that being
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
said right right now we've been
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
averaging 12 we Crest at 18. we bought
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
them out at five at times
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
and you know but through all of that the
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
idea is that you still when an average
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
of 12 you need flexibility within your
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
building we don't want any more kids
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
there than we need and I think our
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
history shows that we don't have a
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
history of over utilizing the facility
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
right I have 144 beds today and if
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
there's only five kids that need to be
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
there then only five kids are in that
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
building right we're not trying to fill
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
this building up but the 18 beds would
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
give flexibility to make sure that
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
you're able to even if we are at a point
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
where we only needed eight
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
that you're able to separate kids based
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
on gender based on criminal activity
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
gang affiliations based on behavioral
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
challenges between them so I I guess you
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
know my my belief is that the 18 beds
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
really is not an excessive number and
 
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.339 align:start position:0%
isn't a reason for us to not move
 
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
forward with this because at the end of
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
the day all you're really getting is
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
some extra flexibility to allow us to
 
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
have appropriate separation of kids at
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
times based on their needs
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
but with that I'm happy to go into the
 
00:34:24.609 --> 00:34:24.619 align:start position:0%
data oh
 
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead and hit this data sure so we
 
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
talked about this last time right you do
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
see around 2018 two things happened at
 
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
once right the system of care SB 14 at
 
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
the time passes big investment happens
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
at that time with the system of care
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
coming up at the same time changes in
 
00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:42.419 align:start position:0%
our laws around detention and commitment
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
and who could be detained and committed
 
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
happens so you see this big collapse of
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
who's going into sysc
 
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.089 align:start position:0%
who's going into sysc
now

00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:50.099 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
if what all that happened in the system
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
right because I think we heard testimony
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
last week that that change in law was
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
the only thing that made the difference
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
right I I think last week former chair
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
Kirk suggested that that's the big thing
 
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
that's happened and that we could change
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
all of this just by
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
changing the law again
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure that people are
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
clear that that's not the only thing
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
that's happening here
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
if that's what if that was the only
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
thing that happened you would expect
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
that these kids that used to be at sysc
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
would show up in non-secured programs
 
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
right they'd show up in residential
 
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
you see you know we used to hover around
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
200 Justice involved kids in residential
 
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.490 align:start position:0%
200 Justice involved kids in residential
care

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
and you do see it it makes a jump when
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
that law change happens when sysc stops
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
taking so many kids and then you see it
 
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
start to go down
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
right you see a big jump here around
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
2020 with covet and I'll talk about that
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
in a minute but you see this downward
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
Trend happening long before covid this
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
is the system of care starting to work
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
with kids and starting to get Kids
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
community-based Care
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
so it's already having an impact not
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
just at sysc but also in the residential
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
system and actually really serving kids
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the community where they need to be
 
00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
which is an amazing thing that we should
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
all be really really proud of
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
um what you see down here I like to be a
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
little bit careful to not claim that
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
this 100-ish level in residential which
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
is the current level of kids in juvenile
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
justice in residential care that is
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat suppressed artificially by
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues at residential programs
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
right so I don't want to claim that this
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
is the the new status quo because the
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
real demand is probably slightly higher
 
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
than where this is but the new status
 
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
quo is probably somewhere lower
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
than here because what's been happening
 
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
at the same time is what you see on the
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
the next page of the data with the
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
flagship program of the children's
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
so the flagship program of the system of
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
care is something that we call fast
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
forward it's a high fidelity wraparound
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
program for young people to work for
 
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
young people and their families to work
 
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
with the team the teams led by a
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
clinical person they bring together
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
everybody who's important to that kid
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
and family clinicians who are working
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
with them the schools
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
other family members grandparents and
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
uncles members of the faith community
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
whoever it is that's important to that
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
kid and family and they also put in-home
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
clinicians in the home to start working
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
with the kids they connect the adults
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
with peer support through Nami New
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they connect the kids with
 
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
peer support as well so that the kids
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
have somebody to talk to about the
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
challenges they're facing with you know
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
having mental health challenges
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see here they're serving close to
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
500 kids right I'm not claiming that
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
every kid at sysc is showing up here
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
instead that's not what this is this
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
system serves kids with Behavioral
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care needs across the Spectrum
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
including the Juvenile Justice
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
population but not exclusive to the
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice population right so
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's why these numbers aren't going to
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
be a one for one shift that's not what's
 
00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
happening here but they are absorbing
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
tons of these kids that used to be in
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
residential care and used to be at sysa
 
00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:06.140 align:start position:0%
so all that's to say to answer chair
 
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
Wyler's question that yes the system of
 
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
care is having an impact today it's
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
critical that we continue to support and
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
invest that into the future because it's
 
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
going to keep having an impact my
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
experience running a comparable system
 
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:20.099 align:start position:0%
in New Jersey tells me that it will
 
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
continue to have an impact over time
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
but I'm really really cautious that when
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
we're already the lowest detention and
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
commitment in the country that we can
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
start to bank further reductions and
 
00:38:34.849 --> 00:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
that what you're really talking about is
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
the difference between building a few
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
bedrooms on a facility that otherwise is
 
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
going to be comparable
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
right so the savings of building a few
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
bedrooms is
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
not all that significant and then that
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
leads into the conversation about the
 
00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:49.339 align:start position:0%
costs that we can get into in a minute
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
but as I said last time the real savings
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
if we're talking from Strictly an
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
economic perspective from my view is the
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
savings of moving to a shared services
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
model like that's where we're going to
 
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.910 align:start position:0%
model like that's where we're going to
actually

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of sysc that's been
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
operating on an island for a hundred and
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
forty years
 
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
right and now when it's operating on an
 
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
island serving 12 kids where you have to
 
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
run 24 7 nursing in a separate
 
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen and all this other
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
stuff it makes no sense
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
right you put that same program next to
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
a Hampstead or next to a New Hampshire
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
hospital where you can share those
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
services and your operational costs are
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
going to go down by a couple million
 
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
plus a year and that's going to be the
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
savings right worrying about the couple
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
million you're going to spend on five
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
extra bedrooms
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be
 
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the the biggest worry when every
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
single year there's a general fund
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
savings of two to three million out
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
there that we're gonna waste because
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
we're worried about saving two millions
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
in arpa to to prevent us from building
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
five bedrooms
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna put some words in your
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
mouth and and and and if they're not
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
comfortable they're just you know change
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
them what what what I think I heard you
 
00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.329 align:start position:0%
them what what what I think I heard you
say

00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
is that yes system of care has been
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
delivering it's likely to continue to
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
deliver but that we're never going to
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
get to the point where we're at zero
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be some kids
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
that need this level of physical
 
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.050 align:start position:0%
that need this level of physical
security

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
um we've committed to closing the
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
existing facility which means we need to
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
have some kind of a replacement facility
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
that that that's where we're at we we
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
you you aren't prepared to tell us what
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
that number of the capacity of that
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like you're kind of
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a maximum of 18. yeah
 
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right you know when we look
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
at the data for the past three years 18
 
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
has been kind of the high water mark and
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's been rare but we do need
 
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
flexibility for operational reasons
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
right so that's that's where we get to
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
the 18 number it's not that we
 
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
anticipate 18 kids being there regularly
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
it's that we need to have mostly
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
flexibility for kids and on the rare
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
occasion that we hit that high water
 
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
mark we we need to have the op the
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
ability to to meet the demand so so if
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
we do not put the appropriation to have
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
the department go out to start doing
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
some design planning inside evaluation
 
00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
if we don't put it into this budget Bill
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
put it into the budget that's probably
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
at least a four-month delay in having
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
you start that work correct is there any
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
value in delaying having that design
 
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
work done it's going to have to get done
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
is it not I don't think there's any
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
value in delaying any of this is my
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
opinion right we're we're at a point
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
that if we want to be able to use the
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
federal ARP dollars we're really at the
 
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
end of the time frame to hit go
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
we wasted a year not doing anything
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't come to agreement
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
last session
 
00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
and that was already going to be
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
ambitious at this point we're really at
 
00:41:59.569 --> 00:41:59.579 align:start position:0%
the end so if we want to use those
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
resources instead of general fund
 
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
resources for this purpose we really
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
need to hit go as soon as possible if on
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
the other hand we don't care about that
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
then I guess we can wait so so I made a
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
statement before you took you came up it
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
said I fear
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
that a lack of action can lead to an
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
employment collapse at the sununu center
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
is that just hand ringing and
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering on my part what to what
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
extent is that a rational concern I
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
think it's already we've already
 
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
experienced that
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
and the people that are left you know I
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
begged and pleaded and cajoled to stick
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
around promising that there's relief on
 
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
the way that there's a future you know
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
and and the process and pointing to
 
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
these every newspaper article talking
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
about you know when when former chair
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
umberger said we're not going to let
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
this place close in a few months I
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
walked into the facility and I showed
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
them that newspaper article say look
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
like you're going to have a job you know
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
and when the Senate passed that
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
billionaires really I walked in there
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
and I showed them that you know and that
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
gets people to say okay and we've
 
00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:02.420 align:start position:0%
actually been able to start having some
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
productive interviews with people who
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
you know typically interviewing this am
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
I going to have a job if I take this and
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
you know when we can point to those
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
newspaper articles that gives us some
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
some ability to convince people that
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
they have a future if they take a job
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
with us but no if we don't have a plan
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
if we're in limbo
 
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:23.579 align:start position:0%
so so just to make it explicit tell us
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
what the so what factor is so so what if
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
we if we approve this appropriation for
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
design inside evaluation now and instead
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
of four months
 
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
so what what what difference will that
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
make to you and your ability to run this
 
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.650 align:start position:0%
make to you and your ability to run this
mission

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
mission
 
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
well I think certainly if if this is
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a two-step process if you're
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
not going to just go forward with sb1 or
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
something comparable in the short term
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
then we lose the ability to use ARP
 
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
funds for construction that'll be off
 
00:43:57.609 --> 00:43:57.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
were you you've been waiting haven't you
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh then we'll come to you representative
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Weiler
 
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.050 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Weiler
um

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
I just wondered what the um
 
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
how much time do we have with the arpa
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
funds I know there's a time they have to
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
be committed and then you have to spend
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
them down what what is that looking like
 
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not I'm not the expert on that
 
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget director came
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
to the Senate
 
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
um finance committee and testified that
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
it was something around the September
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
2025 Mark or shortly thereafter but it
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
beautiful

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
beautiful
 
00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.190 align:start position:0%
beautiful
five

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
so and that's for completion of the
 
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.630 align:start position:0%
so and that's for completion of the
project

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
do you know that sounds right yes okay
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
so the building would have to be
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
built by then
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
and we also had Charlie Arley house who
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
came and talked about the difference
 
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
between what's in the bill
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
which I think is 15 million at Senate
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
bill one and what he sort of anticipated
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
the actual cost would be
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming we can't get additional
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
arpa money
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
so would that be General funds that we
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
would be looking at
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know the answer to that
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what's available in
 
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
arpa beyond the 15 million there could
 
00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
be additional beyond that but 15 was
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
what was put aside for this project
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
based on the the 15 million came from
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
the estimates that were given by Das
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
back at the original committee that that
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is the only
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
surviving member of
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
the other four members are no longer in
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
um but that that committee received an
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
estimate at that time of 15 million of
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
course since that time we have seen
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
major changes in inflation Workforce
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
labor costs and everything else yielding
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
what was the higher estimate
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I did get an answer on your other
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
question about the arpa funds
 
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.870 align:start position:0%
question about the arpa funds
um

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
it needs to be obligated by 12 31 24 and
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be I'm sorry
 
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.250 align:start position:0%
needs to be I'm sorry
spent

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:21.260 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
by 12 31 26 is what my colleague here is
 
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
telling me
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
okay so that's
 
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.650 align:start position:0%
okay so that's
considerably

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
considerably
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
longer amount of time to spend them yeah
 
00:46:35.809 --> 00:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
we need to be obligated by 12 31 24 so I
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
guess that would mean you'd have to have
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
a contract with the construction company
 
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
by then okay so if the process was you
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
know a two-year design process waiting
 
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.569 align:start position:0%
know a two-year design process waiting
for

00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
you know an approval of which way to go
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
that would make that very difficult but
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I have three questions from
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
Mr ribson that that's okay
 
00:47:01.609 --> 00:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
so the first ones I get hopefully an
 
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
easy one regarding the output funds do
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
we know those funds can be used to build
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
a prison that is um I didn't do that
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
analysis but the folks at uh gopher
 
00:47:11.089 --> 00:47:11.099 align:start position:0%
which I remember I'm not remembering
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
what that stands for but I think
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
everybody in here knows what gopher is
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
um they've they've done that analysis
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
and said yes okay could you just get us
 
00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
that information that you know actual
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
hard copy that says a lawyer said we can
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
um I'd really appreciate that
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
um then two questions related to the
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
changing of the date and Staffing
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
so specifically regarding just sort of
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
keeping the staff
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
my understanding from your previous
 
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
testimony was one of the issues has been
 
00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
that we're talking March 1st so
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's bailing out but now we're
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
talking basically the end of the next
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
biennium which is a significant which we
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
could even go further if you feel that's
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
necessary but wouldn't just having a two
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
plus year extension tell the staff that
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
we are going that they still have jobs
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's not like the thing is going to
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
close suddenly underneath their feet it
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
would certainly be better than the
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
status quo absolutely be better than the
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
status quo I think what would be best
 
00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
would be to show that we actually have a
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
vision for the future and a pathway for
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
the future but it would be better than
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
the status quo and the last question is
 
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
kind of related to that and you and I
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
have talked about this a little bit
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
regarding the trauma informed
 
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.550 align:start position:0%
regarding the trauma informed
therapies

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
therapies
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
um you indicated a big part of the
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
problem so related right now this sudden
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
enclosure was that people didn't get the
 
00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
people to do it because it was going to
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
be closing but again with that longer
 
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
time period to work with couldn't this
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed process begin with in
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
the existing facility knowing that
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
eventually it would be transformed or
 
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
transferred as well to the new facility
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that new facility will be
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
better yeah I mean it's possible right
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's all dependent upon our ability as I
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
said last time to secure a steady stable
 
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
Workforce so if in fact that is that's
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
enough to help us secure a steady stable
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
Workforce then yes it would be possible
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
for us to start implementing those new
 
00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.450 align:start position:0%
for us to start implementing those new
programs

00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
oh thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney you had a question
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago did you get it
 
00:49:07.079 --> 00:49:08.870 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago did you get it
addressed

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:11.579 align:start position:0%
thank you I know I didn't it was
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
bringing it back to the discussion of
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
where plans would go upon designs and my
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
thought and I'm trying to keep track
 
00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
here of all the outstanding issues we
 
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
have floating in the room so at a point
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate I'd like to make that as
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
one of my points like you
 
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.910 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
so I would like
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
to make my request
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
to the division and then we'll go on go
 
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
around and and hear what you think
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
because Mr Ripple needs to take notes
 
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
and and make an amendment
 
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
I am going to ask
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
for you to support
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
keeping this Appropriations language for
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
the design and side evaluation in the
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that we produce now
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
and I I think
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
that that is a good thing to do because
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's inevitable in any ways to to get
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
this design and a side evaluation
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
process started we've heard the
 
00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
department say that the the co-location
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
shared services is a good model to
 
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
reduce operating costs over the long run
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to see some numbers on that
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
I I think uh that yes if we kick the can
 
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
down the road through the next fiscal
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
year that will help some uh to to to for
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
their employment situation
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
but I I can't help but to think that
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
from a morale perspective if they know
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
that we're actually going to start to do
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
the work that we've been talking about
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
for a decade of planning what the future
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
looks like that that says something that
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
a mere delay does not say so so I am I'm
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
asking for your support on continuing to
 
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.470 align:start position:0%
asking for your support on continuing to
have

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
the essence of this paragraph on the
 
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the design and build
 
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
in it and so
 
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
um that's my request
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
yes or no uh representative Weiler
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'll support it how much money do you
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
want to have the design
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
um we've got two million in here this
 
00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:32.579 align:start position:0%
was a straight up design since then
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
we've kicked around the idea of two
 
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
designs a small and a medium and so I
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
don't know if two million still passes
 
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
that sanity check but but that that that
 
00:51:44.329 --> 00:51:44.339 align:start position:0%
that's the amount that's in there yes
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
sir yeah we've got it already on paper
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
let's go with it representative walner
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:00.500 align:start position:0%
yes let's leave the design money and
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh do you want to wait
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
or do you want to say now representative
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
pilersky I just wanted to comment didn't
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
we hear last week for Mr arlinghaus that
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
that is an appropriate amount he said he
 
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:15.059 align:start position:0%
thought it would be 1.8 1.9
 
00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.099 align:start position:0%
you know that's an excellent memory when
 
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
it was just a single design he said 1.6
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
is the number he shared yes good point
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
so so 2 million ought to be yeah I'm
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
just clarifying that yes
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
good point yeah I am after hearing the
 
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
timeline of the arpa funds I think I
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
would um want to see what we could do to
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
get going
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's yes okay
 
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Hull
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
yes and I think we're back to rep what
 
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney was discussing
 
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
which is if they have two conceptual
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
designs who and when they are shared is
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
something that still needs to be worked
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
out I have no issues with kicking them
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
off to do the work
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly significant thing to do
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
sending it just through fiscal may not
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
be the right solution I don't know what
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
the timing is to have two conceptual
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
designs done but I would like to see the
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
two conceptual designs come back for
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
review maybe the the languages they sent
 
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
are sent to the house speaker and the
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
Senate President and the house senate
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
house speaker and Senate President
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
determine how that information is shared
 
00:53:26.049 --> 00:53:26.059 align:start position:0%
in their respective bodies
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
we will come back to that I just gotten
 
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
yes or no at this point representative
 
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.530 align:start position:0%
yes or no at this point representative
erf

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm very uncomfortable with uh doing
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
something with so many
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
questions still outstanding and find it
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
hard to believe that a four-month delay
 
00:53:43.079 --> 00:53:44.150 align:start position:0%
hard to believe that a four-month delay
is

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
the end of the world I mean if the whole
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
committee wants to go along with this
 
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
I'll go along but I think it's not
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
necessary and short-sighted
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
um especially given that we have so many
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
members of not only our committee but
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
the HHS committee which presumably will
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
now have a chance to look at this the
 
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
bigger picture now over the coming
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
months who are new members and don't
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
have the same kind of background depth
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
of background that a number of us have
 
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
to hear from workout and me only for a
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
few terms but others for decades
 
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.770 align:start position:0%
few terms but others for decades
apparently

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
um so if the senses to go along I'll go
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
along but um but I think it's not a good
 
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.650 align:start position:0%
along but um but I think it's not a good
idea

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay for the purposes of the Strava I'll
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
just think of you as a no I I I want to
 
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.390 align:start position:0%
just think of you as a no I I I want to
answer

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
um the point uh this this has been with
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
children and family law not HHS and I
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
know you know that my apologies uh but
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh they have had their batting practice
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
on hb120 and hb120 ended up getting
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
amended in children and family law to
 
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.430 align:start position:0%
amended in children and family law to
include

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
um an amendment that makes it look
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
identical to the sentence version that
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
got passed of sb1
 
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
they've been asked to retain HP 120. I
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to speak with their
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
Vice chair yesterday and said hey so
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
what do you think about hb120 you know
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
you got some new new people over there
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh what do you think and he says he
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
thinks it would have passed uh if they
 
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
had gotten the committee to do it he
 
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
thinks he's lost about four people but
 
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would have passed with an
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
OTP a recommendation on a committee but
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
it's been retained yes sir
 
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
may I respond yes uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
I understand that um I know
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative long as well
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue of whether it would
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
have passed or not passed I think it was
 
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
I went to the hearing um and actually I
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
didn't I was kind of surprised that I
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that actually voted enough
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee yet
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
um but my concern was sitting at that
 
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
meeting that yes the people might vote
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
for it but that doesn't mean that they
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
feel they're informed I mean I've sat
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
through this for several terms and I
 
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
still learn new things so I'm I'm
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
skeptical not only the people on that
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
committee but on ours who are new that
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
they really have a depth of knowledge of
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here and the
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
trade-offs uh going forward thank you
 
00:56:17.569 --> 00:56:17.579 align:start position:0%
Fair Point uh or for this acquisition
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
money do you think you're a yes or no
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
not there yet but uh I'm moving along
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
and I think I need to
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm just very concerned that
 
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
we're we're moving towards a center that
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh is going to adopt uh the
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
reputational uh challenges that come
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
with the existing Center and there may
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
actually be other ways to support these
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
families and these kids without a new a
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
new facility let alone deciding the
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
exact size so you're holding out a
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
belief that one of the options that will
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
other than extending the system of care
 
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:08.780 align:start position:0%
maybe or something
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
yeah perhaps and okay I'm sure I could
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
be brought up to to speed some more and
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
and talk with the commissioner but uh
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I still have a few questions and
 
00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
whether the two million would be well
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
spent or not thank you thank you thank
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
you just a comment yes sir
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
the group that evaluates proposed
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
construction is not the fiscal committee
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's the Public Works committee
 
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of experience at doing
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
this and looking at buildings and that's
 
00:57:43.849 --> 00:57:43.859 align:start position:0%
what they do the whole uh hb25 comes
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
from their analyzes so this would be in
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
that that would be the place this would
 
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
go that and governor and Council will
 
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
also look at construction contracts
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee doesn't doesn't look at
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
construction contracts
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
I I am so glad you gave me a an
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
authentic Dodge to get out of this issue
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
here in the very near term
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
representative Moody that answers my
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative Weiler
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
got it so now it's to you yes or no on
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
the acquisition money on two million
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
dollars is the question on yes I'm good
 
00:58:19.849 --> 00:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
with that okay and so am I so so let's
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh Miss Ripple and include that
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the fresh Amendment
 
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
um and then on the issue this is a
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
little tiny issue and hopefully we can
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
just zip now that we've done this once
 
00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:35.630 align:start position:0%
just zip now that we've done this once
um

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
I I think we need to go ahead and put in
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
there that we want two options we want
 
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
the six to twelve we want the 12 to 18
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
because I think those are going to look
 
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.770 align:start position:0%
because I think those are going to look
different

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.390 align:start position:0%
different
um

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
so what what do you say to that
 
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a good thing and by the time
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
that's done we may have some more
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
experience in which progress and how
 
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
it's moving and I think Mr ribs has a
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
pretty good handle on it what's
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
happening and like he says we're the
 
00:59:03.359 --> 00:59:04.250 align:start position:0%
happening and like he says we're the
lowest

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
lowest
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
so things are happening well maybe it's
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
the population we have uh we just think
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
I hope they don't keep sending MS-13
 
00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
members to our state uh thank you
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative walner yes or no on the
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
two designs
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know that that's not the most
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
important thing to me right now the most
 
00:59:25.609 --> 00:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
important thing to me is I'd really like
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
I would like to see the site evaluation
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
and where it's going to be to me is what
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
I would like to if I were going to
 
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
prioritize what we would do first I
 
00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:37.910 align:start position:0%
prioritize what we would do first I
think

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
coming down to the point of where we're
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
this building is more important right
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
now to me so we just appropriated that
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
money though in the amendment right so
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to take months and we're
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
probably not going to see it till
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
January but in the meantime when they
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
show up in January should they show up
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
with with two two designs
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
probably on the same sites it's this is
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
not affecting the site evaluation this
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
is this is affecting you know the
 
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
options of the next legislature has well
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
it could affect the site evaluation I
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
mean it could affect it I mean one site
 
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
might not be large enough to put in an
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
18 bed and another site might I mean
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
depends on where I don't know where
 
01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
these building sites are at this point
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
yeah so are you a yes or no on the two
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
sites uh evaluations
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
two designs I want to hear what Mr
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
ripson's has no go ahead sure so um as
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
we said before there's three possible
 
01:00:41.329 --> 01:00:41.339 align:start position:0%
sites that are being considered one
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
would be to remain on the current campus
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
which obviously has some disadvantages
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
both from right the the awful history
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
that associated with that campus and
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
um with the fact that you wouldn't have
 
01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
a shared services model being able to be
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
effectuated on that campus you wouldn't
 
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
have those the benefits that you would
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
get the other two options that have been
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
considered are within proximity to New
 
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital or within proximity
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
to Hampstead Hospital because those two
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
sites you'd be able to have a shared
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
services model and those two sites offer
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat different ability to share
 
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:12.849 align:start position:0%
somewhat different ability to share
Services

01:01:12.849 --> 01:01:12.859 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
certainly things like you know
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
facilities laundry food those things
 
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
both options give you the opportunity
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
for shared services for things like
 
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
Clinical Services and education at
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
nursing too you could share across both
 
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
of those but for things like Clinical
 
01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
Services and education you'd get more
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity at a site like Hampstead
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
because they serve you know a youth
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
population in a way that they don't
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
currently serve a New Hampshire hospital
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
but there is work that is anticipated to
 
01:01:42.049 --> 01:01:42.059 align:start position:0%
be done through the through the contract
 
01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:43.859 align:start position:0%
with the design firm to look at the
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
sites and ensure that we have you know
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
an appropriate place to to to do that
 
01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
you know to put a building for that
 
01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:55.150 align:start position:0%
you know to put a building for that
purpose

01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
yeah and how long do you think the site
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation at what point do you think
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
you'll be ready with saying where you
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
so we've you know as I've said before we
 
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
did start with no contracts are signed
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
yet but we did start the process
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
um with Public Works to try to identify
 
01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
an architect and design firm and that
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
part of that contract was to help us
 
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
with the site evaluation work that's one
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
of the first parts of the design process
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
but I I don't remember in the timeline
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
that was proposed what the what the
 
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
timeline was for the site evaluation
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
component of it but the goal was to have
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
that ready to go as soon as we were
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
given the funding and authority to to do
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
so from this body and the governor
 
01:02:47.569 --> 01:02:47.579 align:start position:0%
okay thank you look I'd like to continue
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
going around the table just to get yes
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
or no on the two design versus One
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
Design but do you represent while or do
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
you want to say something now I just
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to add one of the little
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
surprises that come about sometime
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
before the present Youth Center was
 
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.390 align:start position:0%
before the present Youth Center was
built

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
built
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
I was had a tour of the uh the dcyf
 
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
seems like the meals were catered and
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
brought in to each living unit and there
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
was several different units
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
so now we open this this Center and the
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
whole thing was oh we didn't have to
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
worry about the security and moving from
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
building to building and have security
 
01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:27.299 align:start position:0%
so we can have them all in one building
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
where they can't jump away and run out
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
so we go and we said first thing we said
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
so what did we save
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
D oh sorry
 
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's more expensive to operate
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
why is that well now we have a kitchen
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
and we have to have staff there 18 hours
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
a day which we never had before
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
and so why didn't they figure this in
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
you know this is the thing that disturbs
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
me that
 
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know what they were paying for
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
the meals brought in but when you have
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
four or five people there 18 hours a day
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
that was that was quite a big change in
 
01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:05.579 align:start position:0%
cost and I used one you still have with
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
all those all that kitchen for the low
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
population so we've got to think of
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
these things that's why it's important
 
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
to have the shared services
 
01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
so you know we don't have the this
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
kitchen set up to feed 140 people and
 
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
now it's feeding a lot less so that's
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
one of the things I just it's one of the
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
things I recall that was surprised they
 
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
hadn't calculated this in
 
01:04:32.829 --> 01:04:32.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that uh representative
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
honestly I don't think I
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
have enough knowledge to actually speak
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
to that because I don't have this is the
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
one place you get to abstain I I think I
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
would abstain although I will I will say
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
that the the lack of the site at this
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
point is concerning to me also
 
01:04:58.609 --> 01:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
um because I feel like we're just
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
shooting in the dark not knowing where
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
we're going so to hear that
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
it sounds like one of those sites is
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
potentially eliminated if we're talking
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
about the sununu center
 
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
then I guess that makes me
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
a little more comfortable
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
um but I do feel like we're
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
deciding something that we're not sure
 
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
where it's going and I would really love
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
more of a staged approach
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
but I at this point will I will back off
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
from giving a commitment to the beds
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
so let me ask this question then do you
 
01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
do you know if there's any uh geography
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
limitations that's not the right word
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
but uh could could we build an 18
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
bed facility near the New Hampshire
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
hospital because they they have swamp
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
issues and not a lot of buildable land
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
is a is that even is to I think
 
01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative Waller brings up the
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
point we got to worry about the site
 
01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:01.619 align:start position:0%
well if one of those sites can't support
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
an 18 bed facility because of the
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
location then then that does sort of
 
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
start to limit what we might see in the
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
future yeah and I I don't know the
 
01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
answer to that right the the state
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
office campus you know there's there are
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
there's land around there but the
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
viability of all that land and there's
 
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
also unused buildings around there that
 
01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
may be the space of those buildings are
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
ought to be appropriate space as well so
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
that's part of what the site review
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
process would be looking at
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative hole the one one
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
design or two designs
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
I would be in favor of two
 
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:43.940 align:start position:0%
I've more points to make based on this
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
well this is really the point we have a
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
whole raft of questions that are just
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
coming up right here in this short
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
meeting that we've had and let's start
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
there I agree with representative
 
01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
solorski I think the Department's
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
already eliminated the sonuna site and I
 
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with that but that
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
was pretty clear when a moment ago he
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
said we these shared services are a big
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
part of the cost savings which says to
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
me we've also eliminated New Hampshire
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
hospital because they also just recently
 
01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
said that essentially the best cost
 
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
savings will be achieved at the at the
 
01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital site
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
also I'm is Public Works going to then
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
be deciding whether we go with a 6 to 12
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
or a 12 to 18 is that part of this is
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
that how this citing thing is is working
 
01:07:26.819 --> 01:07:27.950 align:start position:0%
that how this citing thing is is working
out

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so I I
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
I'm just frustrated that this we have
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
all these questions that are coming up
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
from around the committee room and here
 
01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
we are saying well we'll just throw two
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars in and get the ball
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
rolling thank you
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
I don't think so so I'm a yes I'd rather
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I should say I'm a yes to your
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
question because I think we should both
 
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
should be considered I don't think this
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
is the right way to do it all right so
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
so you're yes to two two two designs and
 
01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler did you have
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
something to say I don't think Public
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
Works would decide
 
01:08:00.049 --> 01:08:00.059 align:start position:0%
on what the size of it should be they
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
will decide on things like where it
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
would be what kind of structure it would
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
be how it would be built and things like
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
that but they would look at the proposal
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
they would look at the two proposals if
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's two different sizes and say you
 
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
know here's what needs to be done on
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
this one here's what needs to be done on
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
that one they may be able to give us
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
some figures of what the final cost
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
would be but I don't think they would
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
step in and say this is the one you got
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
to build not this one I don't think they
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
would get in at that level they're just
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
going to evaluate what is proposed
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
before them
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
right right I I and I I just would want
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
to add that um I I feel like I've been
 
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
looking at this exact same issue since
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill came to us two years ago
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
in division three I mean it's
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
essentially the same conversation except
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
we're getting smarter we're getting
 
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
deeper but but the terrain of what we're
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
talking about I think is largely
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
unchanged uh it's my perspective do you
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
have a one versus two design
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
yeah assuming I get there uh get that
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
far I would say that I would prefer two
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
to one thank you all right
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely on two I think it's customary
 
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
for Architects first of all in their
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
designs to have multiple options and
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
second of all we've heard repeatedly
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
from this gentleman here that 18 is a
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable number to go forward so that
 
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
has got to be explored thank you thank
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
you and I'm also a too okay so so that
 
01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:33.299 align:start position:0%
we've teed this up now a couple times
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
when they get these designs
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
how are we going to get to the decision
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
of build X or build y or build something
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
totally Z like what what's the process I
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
I hear we want to do some Public Works
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh pass through to what I I don't know
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
how to do this I have no clue on how to
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
we got the expert here
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
he's looking at what's happening
 
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.950 align:start position:0%
he's looking at what's happening
Nationwide

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
Nationwide
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I don't trust that the
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
president Administration not to be
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
packing Us full of illegal immigrants
 
01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
some of which will be gang members let's
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
stay on topic well that's a possibility
 
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
they're being sent all over the country
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
so we've got to we've got to be aware of
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
that and here's the expert he's going to
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
be very attuned to what's happening
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
and we're going to look at another year
 
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
or two of experience and see so one of
 
01:10:30.169 --> 01:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
the what's the trend what are you seeing
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then he's going to make the decision
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
of what he thinks is best for us and
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
it's not going to come down to us it's
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to come down to the experts what's
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
the real experience what do we need what
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
is working and that's at that point we
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
choose so is it who is the we choose is
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
it I'm I'm trying to interpret what I
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
think I just heard you say and it
 
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
sounded like you implied representative
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
Weiler that that we would let the
 
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
department choose between the design
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
options and I I don't I don't think
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's what you mean but that's what I
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
think I heard that's what I mean we
 
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
would let the department advise us what
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
was best okay so they would be in an
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
advisory role but who would make the
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
decision I I just want to know who will
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
make the decision is it the GNC is it is
 
01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
it is a governor is it who I mean
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
because I I assume we need to write
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
something in we're saying we're getting
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
this data somebody's going to have to do
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
something with this data the big thing
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
we need is a decision we make we make
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
the laws we put it in law
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
this is what's funded this is what we
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
oh okay representative Wallner do you
 
01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
have thoughts on this who decides how to
 
01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:49.970 align:start position:0%
have thoughts on this who decides how to
decide

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
well I think the legislature decides
 
01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
we'll make the final decision I don't
 
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
really think you leave that up to the
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
administration to make that decision I
 
01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
think that's it's a legislative we would
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate the funds for whichever
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
model we went with
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that's a legislative that's our job
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think we would leave it
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
up to anyone else where would it where
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
in your view where would it enter the
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislative process probably have to
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
come in as a piece of legislation as a
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
separate piece of legislation imagine it
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
would would okay now you're going to
 
01:12:28.689 --> 01:12:28.699 align:start position:0%
have two options
 
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
so I think you would probably have to
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
have some sort of legislation to say
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're picking option A or B
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
so let's let's get ready to park that
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
after representative tolerski has her
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
I just have a question that perhaps you
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
all can answer for me who would be
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
considered the experts in this
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic approach of care to these
 
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.550 align:start position:0%
therapeutic approach of care to these
children

01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
is it children and family law is it
 
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services Nelly fairs is
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
it you guys I'm
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
who has that knowledge well it's the
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
department it's in the executive branch
 
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
but within the legislature
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
um uh HHS would probably be better
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
qualified from an evaluation of the
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
therapeutic model than any of the other
 
01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
committees you mentioned children and
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
family law is interested in the you know
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
sort of the Child Welfare impacts and
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
implications we're worried about it from
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the financial aspects Public Works is
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
worried about it from is this the right
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
construction have we thought of
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
everything as the bonding right I you
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
know I don't know what all they do but
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't think there's one uh
 
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
one answer or or or one committee that
 
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
can answer everything but to your
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
question I think the best qualified is
 
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.610 align:start position:0%
question I think the best qualified is
HHS

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.729 align:start position:0%
HHS
foreign

01:13:58.729 --> 01:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
so look what might come down to
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
here's the bigger building here's the
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
smaller building the bigger building is
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
only a million dollars more
 
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.510 align:start position:0%
only a million dollars more
wow

01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
wow
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
why don't we just go with that then we'd
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
have room I mean it's going to be a
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
difference in the costs and all that
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and from the cost we're
 
01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
looking at now
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
I remind us that the original sysc was
 
01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
built for about 20 million dollars now
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know 12 to 18 bed for the same
 
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.689 align:start position:0%
I don't know 12 to 18 bed for the same
price

01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
price
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
much smaller building so so what I'd
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
like to do is I'd like to park this
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
issue on how we get a decision out of
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
the legislature because I think later I
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
want to talk about something that's in
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
sb1 related to the commission that the
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
Senate it was important to them and so
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
when when we get a chance to bring that
 
01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
back up I think this topic may fit
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
within that so let's park that
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
um I think I think we just worked
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
through the Appropriations issue
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
um rep or Mr Ripple what would read that
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
read what you think we've agreed to so
 
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.050 align:start position:0%
read what you think we've agreed to so
far

01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh well so far I think you've agreed to
 
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
keep the dates and representative
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
walner's Amendment or at least that's my
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
understanding the June 30th 2025. you've
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
agreed to keep the two million dollar
 
01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh it sounds like the
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
members would prefer two options
 
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
although what happens with those two
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
options is yet to be decided
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
um so that's what I have so far
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's a fair summary from my
 
01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
point of view so so next up let's talk
 
01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
about the operations money to get from
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
one March to the end of the fiscal year
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
I I think the 1.5 million number has
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
been floated and vetted a few times
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
um uh you had mentioned 1.6 at one point
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
just in passing but then you were
 
01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
comfortable with 1.5 so so what do you
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
what do you think the real answer is
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
I am comfortable with 1.5 when I when we
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
sat down with our fiscal folks the
 
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
current shortfall was 1.6 and again that
 
01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
was because of revenues that we weren't
 
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
going to be able to draw in it was
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
because of overtime burning much higher
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
than anticipated also because we had a
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
number of retirements that were
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
unanticipated when somebody retires the
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
state has to pay out leave time in a
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
large lump sum and some of those
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
employees were very long-term employees
 
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
with a lot of banked time so that all
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
comes out of the budget as well Okay so
 
01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
we've we've written somewhere Mr Ripple
 
01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
a paragraph on the 1.5 million I can't
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
put my fingers on it it's in the bill as
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
introduced okay can you can you just
 
01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
grab it and and inherit it into this
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
amendment yes okay uh that you could do
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
that is there anyone that disagrees with
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 additional
 
01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:01.970 align:start position:0%
okay all right
um

01:17:01.970 --> 01:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
okay so if we were to stop right there
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
we've achieved success
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
right I but I don't want to stop right
 
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
there and the reason no no no
 
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
and and I'll tell you why though I I I
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
think the Senate
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
using the committee conference and using
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
a pretty deliberative process came up
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
with some elements that they put into
 
01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.850 align:start position:0%
with some elements that they put into
sb1

01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
sb1
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
at least one of them I think was
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical to getting them the
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
24 to nothing support and if we're going
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
to send sb1 back to them
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh and say hey this is what we're going
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
to do take it or leave it I would at
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
least like to sweeten the pot a little
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
bit to show that we know the hard work
 
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
that they did
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
so so I would like to bring your
 
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
attention to my Amendment 0 1 9 2.
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
I I have one do you have one
 
01:18:28.739 --> 01:18:33.890 align:start position:0%
I I have one do you have one
representative

01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
this should be Amendment Z two yes to
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment to HP 49 that's what we're
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
discussing so this is an amendment to 49
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
it lay number zero one nine two
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay I would ask you to flip to page
 
01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.970 align:start position:0%
okay I would ask you to flip to page
five

01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
and note from lines one
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
down to 34.
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
there's a a new subdivision on the
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
commission to study Public Safety of the
 
01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
secured Youth Development Center
 
01:19:10.739 --> 01:19:11.930 align:start position:0%
secured Youth Development Center
okay

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
now what what is this paragraph in terms
 
01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:18.500 align:start position:0%
of the discussion process
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
when this was not in sb1
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
this was not in the First Amendment to
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
sb1 I'll just refer to casually as the
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
Carson Amendment to the to the sb1 this
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
was in the Second Amendment this was
 
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
essential to uh to securing the support
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
of at least two senators that
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
represented uh Hampstead the Hampstead
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
area so so
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
the senate had to work its way through
 
01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
it and this commission that they said
 
01:19:59.450 --> 01:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
should be established I I I think is
 
01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
probably still a good idea
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
and could help for the next part of the
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
discussion is what do we do with these
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
two options later you know maybe this
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
commission could have some role in that
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to shut up and give you a
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
few moments to read lines one through 34
 
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.580 --> 01:21:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
ER all right I represented Hampstead in
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
my district for 20 years and now I it's
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
not in my district but this is uh
 
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative bird cell's complaint
 
01:21:38.209 --> 01:21:38.219 align:start position:0%
that I have discussed with her
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
at the cinema Youth Center
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
the Manchester police are frequently
 
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
called I remember having a conversation
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
with someone who had been a Manchester
 
01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.030 align:start position:0%
with someone who had been a Manchester
policeman

01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
policeman
 
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
who had
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
captured The Runaways if you will and
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
that was when it was not closed in like
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
it is now
 
01:21:55.679 --> 01:21:56.570 align:start position:0%
it is now
um

01:21:56.570 --> 01:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
the state police
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts are closer than the
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
State Police from New Hampshire to
 
01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:07.729 align:start position:0%
State Police from New Hampshire to
Hampstead

01:22:07.729 --> 01:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
Hampstead
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
and the sheriff is is still like 12
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
miles away the local police it's not
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
that big a department
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
they still have local police but I think
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
they may still have a part-time Chief
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
there's about three towns around me that
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
have part-time Chiefs which isn't a bad
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
thing but they're not always there every
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
day so there is some uh but there is
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
full-time police evidence in the town of
 
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.149 align:start position:0%
full-time police evidence in the town of
Hampstead

01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
Hampstead
 
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
that was her concern did they have
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
enough manpower if they had to say it
 
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
all out search someone's runaway or
 
01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
three of runaway or something like that
 
01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
and you know they've they've had people
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
leave the Hampstead Hospital that
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be that big a deal
 
01:22:51.649 --> 01:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
it's the same one of the same
 
01:22:51.659 --> 01:22:53.090 align:start position:0%
it's the same one of the same
populations

01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
populations
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
so troubled youth
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
so um I think she's overly concerned
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
with this but obviously they did this to
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
get her vote what they want to do is is
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
get in an evaluation of the
 
01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.130 align:start position:0%
get in an evaluation of the
um

01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
of the security of the site
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
I don't see it as a problem because most
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
of the commission is
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be legislators and we're not
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
paying them a lot but one of the other
 
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
things that we have to remember
 
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
that may serve in this group is
 
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
last budget we put up a hundred million
 
01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
dollars for abuses by staff
 
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the of the children
 
01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars and now all the
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers are foaming at the mouth and
 
01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
lining up but anyway
 
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
what this thing could look into is
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
what is the what is the um oversight of
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
the people within this facility to
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
ensure this never happens again and and
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
who is who is making sure and what is
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
what is the type of security within the
 
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
system I think that's just as important
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
as figuring out where the nearest police
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
department is and hopefully this
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
commission will work on that because we
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to have a repeat of what
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
we've gone through thank you
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
okay so the topic that I'm I'm trying to
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
have us focus on is do we want to lift
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
this language from Amendment
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
0192 lines 1 through 34 and include it
 
01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.110 align:start position:0%
0192 lines 1 through 34 and include it
and

01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm still going to call it the walner
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
amendment for now
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and maybe maybe this needs to be
 
01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:35.300 align:start position:0%
tweaked to be as inclusive as
 
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler just suggested but
 
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
but uh but I but I want to get the sense
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
of the of the division on whether it
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
adds value to include this language and
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
I I propose it does I think they've got
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
some good things to be looking at in
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
parallel there's an ongoing group of
 
01:24:56.209 --> 01:24:56.219 align:start position:0%
people that can continue to continue to
 
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
discuss this
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
um and and plus we would be reflecting
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
back a major piece of sb1 to the Senate
 
01:25:06.649 --> 01:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
to say we listened to you we heard you
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
this was a good idea we're on board so
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
so I think that is how we help ourselves
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
get to yes
 
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
so representative walner your thoughts
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
well again it feels like to me that this
 
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
piece goes right back to needing to know
 
01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
where the site is
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
um that's
 
01:25:29.330 --> 01:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
seems to me that's one of the major
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
things that needs to be decided because
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
this this is really about Community
 
01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.750 align:start position:0%
this this is really about Community
involvement

01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
yeah well and it's a but it could be
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
about Concord
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
and it might be about Manchester I mean
 
01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
we don't really know for sure
 
01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
and maybe no maybe in the end there's
 
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
some other place that materializes
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
um you know I think involving the
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
communities is a really good idea
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I mean I I would not
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
object to putting this in
 
01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure we're really ready
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
because we don't really know how many
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
commit how many commissions are we going
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
to have we're going to have three of
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
them running at the same time
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
for each site that's a possibility or is
 
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
there going to be some decision about
 
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
the site by the time this Commission
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
is in place and I do notice that this
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
commission and this part of Senate bill
 
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
was Senate bill one
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
um really does also
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
say that they're going to bring in
 
01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.270 align:start position:0%
say that they're going to bring in
legislation

01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
oh okay honor before so they're they're
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're anticipating
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
additional legislation on this matter
 
01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:59.050 align:start position:0%
additional legislation on this matter
um

01:26:59.050 --> 01:26:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.169 --> 01:27:02.179 align:start position:0%
just to read the line that I I think uh
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner is accurately uh
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
citing uh it says the commission shall
 
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
submit a preliminary report including
 
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
its findings and any recommendations for
 
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation so if they don't
 
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
have proposed legislation they wouldn't
 
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
include it right if they did they would
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
and that that would be done before uh
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
the November 1 of 2023 which gives
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
um the site evaluation design team some
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
room to work because I think you're
 
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
really close to letting that contract
 
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
once you have the authority to do it
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
so so hopefully come September October
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's some information that's going to
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
be going to this commission if we
 
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
establish it for them to
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
exercise another set of eyes on this
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
to my my only point was that there you
 
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
can see that they're already
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
anticipating that they would bring in
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
legislation additional legislation would
 
01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
come in around the new new sununu center
 
01:28:08.699 --> 01:28:10.070 align:start position:0%
come in around the new new sununu center
right

01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
okay so you're you're okay with that I I
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
could live with this piece being in it
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I don't know that it adds a
 
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
lot or doesn't but I like the idea of
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
communities being involved okay thank
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
you representative do you want me to
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
come back to you or do you have an
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
opinion on this no my only comment was
 
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm reading this the same
 
01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
way that um representative Weiler did in
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
terms of the commission would have
 
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
oversight over the facility the safety
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
of the facility itself
 
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
um and I'm perhaps I just am
 
01:28:45.169 --> 01:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding how it's being written
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
but I thought you know I'm reading it as
 
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
a community-based public safety
 
01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:52.490 align:start position:0%
a community-based public safety
situation

01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
anyone could clarify that I you know
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
this is why I wouldn't have to
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder was done talking I
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
said this would be the bulk of it and
 
01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
then we could tweak it if we needed to
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure it Incorporated is
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
concerned but but I I think I think
 
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
you're you're right that this language
 
01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
itself does not really bring them to the
 
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
task of figuring out Public Safety
 
01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:22.580 align:start position:0%
within it's it's mostly a coordination
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
function with the external and knowing
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
the senator that wanted it in there that
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
was basically about it wasn't about
 
01:29:31.729 --> 01:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
within this the facility but I think
 
01:29:34.129 --> 01:29:34.139 align:start position:0%
that should be a consideration and if
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
the commission was formed I would
 
01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
suggest it to them
 
01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.330 align:start position:0%
suggest it to them
yeah

01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
so so because this is the language that
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
is an sb1 as amended that for the Second
 
01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:46.189 align:start position:0%
is an sb1 as amended that for the Second
Amendment

01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
I I would like to include this
 
01:29:51.649 --> 01:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
to tell the senate look we listened we
 
01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
tried to meet you where we could
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
they don't really have an opinion on it
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative hole oh did
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
you have an another thing you wanted to
 
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
say though okay representative hole
 
01:30:04.729 --> 01:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:30:04.739 --> 01:30:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
no strong opinions either way I do think
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
we're putting the cart before the horse
 
01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
and I say that because of line 16 and 8
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
through 18 right this priest opposes
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we know which town we're in if
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get a representative
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
from a local law enforcement agency or
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal governing body
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
um and then I think if we're going to
 
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
wholesale pick this up and put it in we
 
01:30:31.729 --> 01:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
need to go past lines 35 we have to go
 
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
all the way to the end of page
 
01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
um at least line two maybe line three on
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
page six because there's some repeals of
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
this section of the law that would be
 
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.310 align:start position:0%
this section of the law that would be
incorporated

01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
incorporated
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
so no strong opinions but I think the
 
01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
site selection is the nine is the big
 
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
thing we should be talking about and
 
01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
whether if there was anything that would
 
01:30:55.129 --> 01:30:55.139 align:start position:0%
be the commission to put in this
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
amendment that there is a well-defined
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
site commission maybe that language
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
exists from some other bill from
 
01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
someplace before put that in here I
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
just just say your last sentence again I
 
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
I got distracted looking for something
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
sure so I think the key element is
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
making sure the site selection committee
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
is part of this amendment if we were
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to do something because that's the
 
01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
piece of this puzzle that needs to be
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
solved long before we get to page five
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting this could double as a
 
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
site selection committee particularly if
 
01:31:39.649 --> 01:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
we added a line to make that part of the
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
their Charter there without or we have
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
not yet designated what a site selection
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee would look like
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're not there yet go ahead I have a
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
question for either
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
um Mr ribstone or Mr Ripple right and
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
this is naiveness on my part due to just
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
coming up to speed on this bill where
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
are we on site selection what was
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
authorized by Statute before
 
01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.990 align:start position:0%
authorized by Statute before
when

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
there was there was nothing authorized
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
by Statute specific to site selection
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
this went through the entire process
 
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
last year all the way to Committee of
 
01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
conference with almost no conversation
 
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
about site selection that was going to
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
be it seemed left to the department and
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
Governor to resolve
 
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
um but in this session that has become
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
the pressing issue at least in the
 
01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
Senate and a and a pressing issue here
 
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:32.780 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you question for the chair yes
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to have a draft of
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
a site selection committee Amendment
 
01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
kind of based on what is on page five
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
but with a focus more about site
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
selection because the Personnel might be
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
different that way and you might in fact
 
01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:53.900 align:start position:0%
have Representatives
 
01:32:59.689 --> 01:32:59.699 align:start position:0%
speaking to line 16 16-19 from all three
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
communities that are currently in
 
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
um that are currently under
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
consideration right members from Hampton
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
members from Concord members from
 
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester sorry Hamstead having those
 
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
as part of this to make this
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
both the focus of this to be more than
 
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
just safety but to be site selection and
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
that there's representatives from the
 
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
public from the areas of interest that
 
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
seems to make sense so let me uh let me
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
respond to that the way I would I would
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
deal uh incorporate what you just said
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
on line 16 I would change the phrase a
 
01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.290 align:start position:0%
on line 16 I would change the phrase a
representative

01:33:36.290 --> 01:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
to saying Representatives
 
01:33:39.719 --> 01:33:40.970 align:start position:0%
to saying Representatives
from

01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement agencies make that
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
plural so that that line
 
01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:49.580 align:start position:0%
basically says bring in the potential
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
sites and similarly uh
 
01:33:57.010 --> 01:33:57.020 align:start position:0%
do the same thing with line 18
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
representatives from Municipal governing
 
01:34:01.199 --> 01:34:02.810 align:start position:0%
representatives from Municipal governing
bodies

01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
that that way they could make the they
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
could tailor the commission more to the
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know sort of conquered Hampstead
 
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester thing
 
01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
um that that would be my approach to to
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with an aspect of what you just
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
say up there in line five six seven
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there basically add an
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
additional Clause to that first sentence
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
so it reads something like and I'll let
 
01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple Ward Smith this if you're okay
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
with the idea is uh on line five there
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
is established a commission to study the
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
public safety
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
of the secured Youth Development Center
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
and site selection
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
considering the surrounding communities
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
and and that way we get the site
 
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
selection Mission into the charter of
 
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
the commission yes sir
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
if I may yep um thank you
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
I would put it I would word Smith it
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
slightly differently so I'll propose it
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
right there has established a commission
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
to study the location of and the public
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
Rank and then to study the public safety
 
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
of I I don't that's fine I think it's
 
01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
the same meaning in yours is probably
 
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
Superior language I'll defer to Mr
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
Ripple who actually has to generate a
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
note for OLS
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
so if that's okay we because we could
 
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
we're going to review this tomorrow
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
um but do you do you think you have have
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
we confused you or are you on top of
 
01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.090 align:start position:0%
we confused you or are you on top of
this

01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
I think I get it so you want to add
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
basically the committee that's in
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
section six of this amendment for Senate
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
bill one uh add site selection to the
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
charge somewhere around line five uh
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
pluralize representatives from local law
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement enforcement agencies and
 
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:01.139 align:start position:0%
representatives from Municipal governing
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
bodies on line 16 through 18.
 
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
and I think otherwise it would stay the
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
same now do you want to keep the
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
reporting dates down on lines 32 and 33
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
as is uh I I think I think we want to
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
keep the first one as is the second one
 
01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
starts to feel a little Superfluous like
 
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
like it just got added because the all
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
these commissions have two reporting
 
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
dates and that's sort of a generic
 
01:36:29.689 --> 01:36:29.699 align:start position:0%
second reporting date so I don't I don't
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
have a strong opinion on the second
 
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
reporting date
 
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
go ahead go ahead represent hole thank
 
01:36:38.649 --> 01:36:38.659 align:start position:0%
you um so in lines probably
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
32 right recommendations for proposed
 
01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:44.330 align:start position:0%
32 right recommendations for proposed
legislation

01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:47.060 align:start position:0%
um both for right and location I think
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
if we're tasking them to be a site
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
selection they should be recommending a
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
location as well so
 
01:36:53.699 --> 01:36:54.229 align:start position:0%
location as well so
um

01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether and someone
 
01:36:58.129 --> 01:36:58.139 align:start position:0%
else may be able to speak to it a
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
November 1st 2023 deadline is the right
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
deadline for a proposed location or
 
01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:06.179 align:start position:0%
should that be sooner
 
01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:08.699 align:start position:0%
it does say or before
 
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
so there's there's nothing in here that
 
01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
forces them to wait
 
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
good point okay
 
01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
so I I know that this um there's a lot
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
of concern about public safety and this
 
01:37:27.719 --> 01:37:29.629 align:start position:0%
of concern about public safety and this
um

01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
program for
 
01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:32.330 align:start position:0%
program for
um

01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
young people
 
01:37:38.570 --> 01:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
but you know this pretty much focuses on
 
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
but I do know as just being from Concord
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
I do know that we often a lot of a lot
 
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
of things around the state buildings
 
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
that we're concerned about is the fire
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
how much the fire department can respond
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
I mean we do have the prison we have a
 
01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
number of we have a number of
 
01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:58.790 align:start position:0%
number of we have a number of
um

01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
buildings here in the in the capital
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
that we have to respond to with our fire
 
01:38:06.290 --> 01:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
department and this really this seems to
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
be only law enforcement I do see there
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
is a line here that talks about a
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative for municipal government
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
but I do think that
 
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.850 align:start position:0%
but I do think that
communities

01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
are real
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
the fire and ambulance services
 
01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
for these kinds of facilities are as
 
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
important I think as the law enforcement
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
right yeah if if I may as as a member of
 
01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:36.179 align:start position:0%
the cheap seats watching the Senate go
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
through all this negotiation I wasn't
 
01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
there you're absolutely right fire was
 
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
was part of that concern it I'm I'm like
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
you a little surprised it didn't make it
 
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
into the commission language and and I
 
01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
would just say that they didn't ignore
 
01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
it though the way they dealt with that I
 
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
think is on the very front page
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
um line 24. where it reads the
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
department shout to the extent practical
 
01:39:02.689 --> 01:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
practicable Implement any reasonable
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
requests by the communities to ensure
 
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
the safe operation of the facility
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
Implement a payment in lieu of taxes
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
arrangement to prevent the shifting of
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
costs to local taxpayers and ensure
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the prospective
 
01:39:21.169 --> 01:39:21.179 align:start position:0%
community so so that was meant to be you
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
know sit down with a community work out
 
01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:27.260 align:start position:0%
Community Support
 
01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
requirements and implications and let's
 
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
figure out what we the state owes you
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
for that support so so they didn't
 
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
ignore it they just didn't put it into
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
the commission Charter
 
01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:42.620 align:start position:0%
and and and I I'm sort of foreshadowing
 
01:39:48.169 --> 01:39:48.179 align:start position:0%
but but this line from 22 down to 33 on
 
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
page one feels
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
feels like something that could be in
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
the walner amendment or doesn't need to
 
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.350 align:start position:0%
the walner amendment or doesn't need to
be

01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
um but if if we don't include this
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
because we think this is good budget
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
fodder for hb2
 
01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
then then maybe maybe to your point
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
about fire and maybe other local
 
01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
Services because I don't know if I mean
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
do we do we list them all
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
sewer water no you know I mean so so if
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
there's some generic way to tell the
 
01:40:21.239 --> 01:40:22.910 align:start position:0%
there's some generic way to tell the
commission

01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
that they're looking at more than the
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
public safety issue but they're looking
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
at you know Community Support
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
Arrangements which include Public Safety
 
01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.770 align:start position:0%
Arrangements which include Public Safety
fire

01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
fire
 
01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:34.669 align:start position:0%
fire
Etc

01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
well I think it would be I mean it would
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
be the charge of this commission I would
 
01:40:45.410 --> 01:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
think to look at right and we could say
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
I think having the representative from
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
the municipal government yep probably
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
that person is probably going to bring
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
those things up right
 
01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
um so so Mr Ripple
 
01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
just just to help make sure that they we
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
we don't let have them obsess on Public
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
Safety on on on line five there is
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
established a commission to study the
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
community impacts of the secured Youth
 
01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:15.620 align:start position:0%
Development Center to the to the
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities to include
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
Public Safety fire
 
01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:23.450 align:start position:0%
Public Safety fire
Etc

01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
I I I I think I think that gets us all
 
01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
in line with where we want to go
 
01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
having done a lot of site plans when
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
there was on planning board
 
01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
one of the firemen came in at one point
 
01:41:41.209 --> 01:41:41.219 align:start position:0%
they were building a nice building and
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
it was had some very tall trees in the
 
01:41:44.810 --> 01:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
back and they thought that was nice
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
having these trees around and the
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
firemen said
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
if this building catches on fire we want
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to fight the fire from all
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
sides you have to have access to the
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
rear of the building the sides of the
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
building otherwise we're not as
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
successful at putting out the fire we
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
have to be able to get the trucks and
 
01:42:04.129 --> 01:42:04.139 align:start position:0%
whatever all the way around the building
 
01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
get a good site of where where the fire
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
is coming out where we have to start to
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
to fight the fire and it made it very
 
01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
logical statement that none of us ever
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
thought of before yeah you call the fire
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
department you've got this nice building
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
all trees surrounded and just front lawn
 
01:42:21.649 --> 01:42:21.659 align:start position:0%
and that's the only place they can fight
 
01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
it from the front but the fire might
 
01:42:25.729 --> 01:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
have started in the back and they can't
 
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
even see it till when they drive up so
 
01:42:30.649 --> 01:42:30.659 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing that the fire
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
department will come in and talk about
 
01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
that most of us don't think about but
 
01:42:38.090 --> 01:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
I I think that you know the idea of
 
01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
having some firemen come take a look at
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
this proposal is is probably a good idea
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay um maybe this will just go real
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
quick in or out yes or no
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
add the commission with the the
 
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
qualifiers that that I said to Mr Ripple
 
01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:56.930 align:start position:0%
qualifiers that that I said to Mr Ripple
uh

01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder yes or no
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
add what add the commission from page
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yes yes add the commission yes
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm fine with the commission uh
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
I like the wording of the community
 
01:43:16.139 --> 01:43:17.450 align:start position:0%
I like the wording of the community
impact

01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
um over the public safety I think it
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
Embraces more of what we need to learn
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay keep keep your eye on that when we
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
see the language tomorrow Mr Ripple
 
01:43:28.609 --> 01:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
uh representative hole no opinion either
 
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
way uh representative
 
01:43:33.649 --> 01:43:33.659 align:start position:0%
so since I didn't get a chance to speak
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
I'm going to now
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a problem with the
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
commission I'll say that with the bat
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
although I don't understand what its
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
intent is what its purpose is how it
 
01:43:44.810 --> 01:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
ties into the selection the choice of
 
01:43:47.209 --> 01:43:47.219 align:start position:0%
six or eight out of the 12 unit of 18
 
01:43:47.219 --> 01:43:48.590 align:start position:0%
six or eight out of the 12 unit of 18
unit

01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I mean it's an interesting
 
01:43:52.729 --> 01:43:52.739 align:start position:0%
concept but it really it's really not
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
tied to the bill I mean we sort of
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
started to tie it here which is great
 
01:43:59.689 --> 01:43:59.699 align:start position:0%
but again these are all issues that we
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
could take up with a with more time to
 
01:44:04.609 --> 01:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
actually get it right if it were done
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
not under this rushed uh time frame so
 
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with it being in there not sure
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
what his purpose is at this point
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative stream
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it's fine that it'd be added
 
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you I would
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
just say that you know when I read this
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
I see it as a commission on Public
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
Safety that is Paramount there is no
 
01:44:27.169 --> 01:44:27.179 align:start position:0%
question and I don't really see that
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
tied to one location or another whether
 
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
it's where it is now or where it will be
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
with a site to be
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
determined uh I think my first choice
 
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
would be almost periodic reviews
 
01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
on certain deadline dates into this
 
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
legislation from these particular
 
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
members of different departments and
 
01:44:54.530 --> 01:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
Community safety personnel over a
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
commission that would be my first choice
 
01:44:59.570 --> 01:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
so I'll take a
 
01:45:02.689 --> 01:45:02.699 align:start position:0%
a no opinion I suppose on the commission
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
leaning no
 
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
okay so so I think I think we have a
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
close enough to yes
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
so so let's let's go ahead and put that
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:45:17.209 --> 01:45:17.219 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and and then your your point about
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
the periodic reports
 
01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.030 align:start position:0%
the periodic reports
um

01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
you know the good news is that on page
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
three towards the bottom starting at
 
01:45:31.729 --> 01:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
line 29 there there was a reporting
 
01:45:31.739 --> 01:45:32.810 align:start position:0%
line 29 there there was a reporting
process

01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
in an effort at this point to not snatch
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
defeat from the jaws of Victory I I
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
would I would like to put a cap on what
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask of the Waller
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment and carry these other things
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
into an hb2 conversation
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
is that is that okay
 
01:45:54.119 --> 01:45:56.149 align:start position:0%
is that is that okay
okay

01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
um so so that's my proposal that we that
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
we update the walner amendment uh with
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
the discussions and agreements we've
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
made today
 
01:46:08.209 --> 01:46:08.219 align:start position:0%
and we'll look at them tomorrow
 
01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
they'll come in also looking like an sb1
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
amendment as well so that when the chair
 
01:46:16.450 --> 01:46:16.460 align:start position:0%
sends us to go do division three work
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
we'll looking at sb1 we've got something
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
comments representative Wallner
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
well I'm going to bring up one
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
one issue that
 
01:46:30.119 --> 01:46:32.750 align:start position:0%
one issue that
hmm

01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
um signaled to me
 
01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.169 align:start position:0%
um signaled to me
um

01:46:42.169 --> 01:46:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
the date that I put in was 2025 I mean I
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
think you saw the date which is is two
 
01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.149 align:start position:0%
think you saw the date which is is two
years

01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
we know the building's going to take
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
longer than that to build
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm wondering if we
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
push the date out or if we are just
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
silent on the date
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
we just
 
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
one reaction to that I'm I the reason I
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
was okay with the date that she selected
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
is it gets us all the way through the
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year and and since we're
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to use the budget process for some
 
01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
of this I was okay with tying it to the
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year process
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
if however you want to extend that that
 
01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
date that you proposed I I would be in
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
favor and in support of of you picking a
 
01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
date that's longer
 
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
so if you want a different date what
 
01:47:42.649 --> 01:47:42.659 align:start position:0%
what what do you think I I'm just I
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
would like to hear what other people
 
01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
think about that because I mean it just
 
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
is something that I was thinking you
 
01:47:51.649 --> 01:47:51.659 align:start position:0%
know we can't ask Mr a few years from
 
01:47:54.649 --> 01:47:54.659 align:start position:0%
now two years from now
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
we could be sitting here
 
01:47:59.689 --> 01:47:59.699 align:start position:0%
trying to once again we're right up
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
against the deadline with no place
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know the building's not done I agree
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
what all right so aggressively and
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
violently so should we ask the
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
department what they think I just would
 
01:48:12.530 --> 01:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
like I'd like to hear what the other
 
01:48:16.450 --> 01:48:16.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf
 
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:25.129 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf
what

01:48:25.129 --> 01:48:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
can we go from the Department first and
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.609 --> 01:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
Mr ribson so um we found ourselves in
 
01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:36.179 align:start position:0%
this pickle because we set a date to
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
close the facility when we didn't yet
 
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
have a plan to replace the facility and
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you know you uh representative
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
Edwards wisely started us off with this
 
01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
process with the chart and and that was
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
kind of the first disclaimer you made
 
01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
right that we we put the cart before the
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
horse claiming that we're going to close
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
this facility on a date certain
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
without a plan yet to replace that
 
01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:56.870 align:start position:0%
without a plan yet to replace that
facility

01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and I very much were and that put us
 
01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
in this place where not only did we not
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
have a plan by the date but the impact
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
that that had on the workforce and the
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
ability to operate the facility has been
 
01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:08.689 align:start position:0%
ability to operate the facility has been
devastating

01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:08.699 align:start position:0%
devastating
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
and I very much worry that having a
 
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
closure date prior to having a viable
 
01:49:17.090 --> 01:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
operational place to go
 
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
is going to cause us to repeat that same
 
01:49:22.129 --> 01:49:22.139 align:start position:0%
exact issue whether it's obviously two
 
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
years is better than three weeks
 
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
um but right
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
I think you know you need to have you
 
01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:30.179 align:start position:0%
need to know where you're going next
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
before you close what you have today
 
01:49:36.050 --> 01:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
so you just said two things you said we
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
could either kick the date beyond the
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
end of the next fiscal year to some
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
other dates certain or I think what you
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
really prefer is that we find a way to
 
01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
be silent on on on the next closure date
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
that's right what sb1 actually says it
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
does have a date by which the new
 
01:49:55.729 --> 01:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
facilities anticipated to be open but it
 
01:49:58.189 --> 01:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
actually talks about the closure of syc
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of it shall be closed when the
 
01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
new facility is ready to accept children
 
01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a more reasonable way
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
to frame this that when you when we have
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
the replacement ready to accept children
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
is of course the date that we would
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
close the current facility
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay so you could find that language
 
01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just I'm just now looking for
 
01:50:22.609 --> 01:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
that language and of course I'm looking
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
at I'm happy to respondent zero one nine
 
01:50:29.229 --> 01:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
two do what I'm happy to respond now
 
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
all right I would say remove the date
 
01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:36.729 align:start position:0%
all right I would say remove the date
okay

01:50:36.729 --> 01:50:36.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
you said move or remove thank you
 
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
um and and and so we got to remove
 
01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:45.410 align:start position:0%
um and and and so we got to remove
option

01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
and that's referred that option twice so
 
01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
what if you can help us find that
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
language Mr ribson
 
01:50:59.229 --> 01:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
oh does it start on the bottom of page
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
one of my Amendment line 33 where it
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
starts upon opening the facility shall
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
be referred to as blank
 
01:51:13.609 --> 01:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
um nope that's not it
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple found that
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
um page two six through nine the sysc
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
shalomy immediately be closed for
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
detention or admission of any child when
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
the secure treatment facility authorized
 
01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
by this chapter is sufficiently
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
completed that children can be legally
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
and safely housed there obviously that
 
01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
language is not exactly perfect from
 
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about but I think
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
there's a framework within there that
 
01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
that could be adjusted there's some
 
01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
dates preceding that March 1 of 2023 and
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
November 1 2024 what would you do with
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
those dates would you these were the
 
01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
dates by which
 
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
um the architect should be procured and
 
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
by which the project would be completed
 
01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
which of course would no longer be
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
relevant in the the current framework
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about well maybe the
 
01:52:00.169 --> 01:52:00.179 align:start position:0%
procurement of the architect would still
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
be relevant but the
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
um the completion of the architectural
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
and side evaluation work is is time
 
01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
sensitive because we're trying to so so
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
maybe leave the first date
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
that would make sense to me I wouldn't
 
01:52:16.370 --> 01:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
have any problem with that and we've
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
already and actually what's what's you
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
know that line anticipates that we're
 
01:52:22.129 --> 01:52:22.139 align:start position:0%
going to procure to do that and in fact
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
DPW has already procured we've already
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
received three bids we've already
 
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
interviewed those folks and we're in the
 
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
process of negotiating a contract but
 
01:52:31.729 --> 01:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
are not going to execute a contract
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
until we have authority and funding to
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
do so okay so you you think you could
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
procure the qualified Architect by March
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
one or do you want a different date well
 
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:43.139 align:start position:0%
procurement just means starting that
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
process so yes we could certainly
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
procure because we've already done it
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay and then the second date the
 
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
have the project
 
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
complete by November 24th that's
 
01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:55.250 align:start position:0%
complete by November 24th that's
impossible

01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
so so just strike some of that
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think that language would
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
make sense in the current
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
framework being discussed oh okay but
 
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
the date that the goat that the Opera
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
money has to be used by
 
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
as as the you said there's a date he has
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
to the projects must be completed by
 
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
almost in 2026. I I think the key date
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
we heard was the date that the money
 
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
needed to be obligated by had to be
 
01:53:25.850 --> 01:53:25.860 align:start position:0%
obligated and again I want to be careful
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
with this because I am not right you're
 
01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
not the expert but but I think I heard
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
the obligation date was the driver and
 
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
from my and it was a military
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
comptroller time the obligation date is
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
what drove tying up federal money
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
if you have a an obligating document the
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
notes the notes I have from the note
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
that was handed to you before said
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
obligated by 12 31 2024 spent by 12 31
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
2026. that's what was handed me again
 
01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
even with that I'd want to be careful
 
01:53:58.250 --> 01:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
the people who do this work would be the
 
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
again this is not critical if we just
 
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
take it out let's take it out let's
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
check it out and but I do I do want
 
01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
um go ahead I'm sorry I'm just going to
 
01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
say I think there still is the issue of
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
we'd have to make sure and it might
 
01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
already be in here but the repeal of the
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
current closure date has to be included
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Ripple will probably take care of
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
that for us as well
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
right so I think that's
 
01:54:26.699 --> 01:54:29.149 align:start position:0%
right so I think that's
so

01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
section one of both the bill as
 
01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
introduced House Bill 49 as as
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
introduced and representative Walden's
 
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment 311h they both deal with that
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh closure date and so that was from
 
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 from two years ago that's
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
being amended here I think that would
 
01:54:45.649 --> 01:54:45.659 align:start position:0%
just need to be repealed uh if you want
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
what you want to do was include
 
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
the language that you just discussed
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.970 --> 01:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
oh okay I I I think I'm good I think I'm
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
confident that you have good notes and
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
that you you can produce an amendment is
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
is that good
 
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:09.060 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.169 --> 01:55:18.179 align:start position:0%
I think there's still the question of
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
the department is presenting two design
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
options but it's unclear who they're
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
presenting them to uh the committee from
 
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one does have some oversight
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that the timing would
 
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
overlap so for example there's no timing
 
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in section two of this
 
01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:41.629 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in section two of this
amendment

01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
Department would come up with two
 
01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
possible options but it doesn't say by a
 
01:55:47.209 --> 01:55:47.219 align:start position:0%
date certain whereas the committee would
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
need to issue its recommendations by
 
01:55:50.930 --> 01:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
November 1st
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
so there are some so what if we said 30
 
01:55:59.450 --> 01:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
September is no later than for the um
 
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
completion of the the two options on the
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
design and that met that marries up with
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
that Commission
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
but that still doesn't answer the
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
who's actually going to make the
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
decision if there's going to be
 
01:56:16.850 --> 01:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
legislation well I think if you left in
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
they would present recommendations for
 
01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation on or before
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
November 1st 2023 so there would be
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman if the
 
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
the information was shared I'm looking
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
at lines 33 and 34 right sent to the
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House president of the
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
Senate house clerk Senate clerk the
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
governor in the State Library
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
their findings would be sufficient to
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
kick off how we deal with it as the
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislature I am very much in sync with
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
walner that the legislature should be
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
the decision-making body and not we
 
01:57:14.089 --> 01:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any disagreement or
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
anyone that feels like they have
 
01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
something to say to that representative
 
01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:22.010 align:start position:0%
something to say to that representative
tolerski

01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
tolerski
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky I'd just like to
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
clarify something now that we started
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
with the walner amendment with two
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars appropriated for the
 
01:57:33.530 --> 01:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
site evaluation architect to consult
 
01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
consultation Etc
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
now we have a commission that we're
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
going to charge with the community
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
impacts and the site selection
 
01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
are they going to have two million
 
01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
dollars to spend is the department going
 
01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this original
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation of two million dollars
 
01:57:51.609 --> 01:57:51.619 align:start position:0%
like where are we at with this because
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused how we got to this
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
point and what the end goal is are we
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
taking site selection away from the
 
01:58:01.609 --> 01:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
Department that was going to have this 2
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
million for site selection
 
01:58:05.810 --> 01:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
let's I just want to make sure we're all
 
01:58:07.689 --> 01:58:07.699 align:start position:0%
on the same page of what we're doing by
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
changing we're not going to get
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
politicians the two million dollars
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to let the executive
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
department have the 2 million that's
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
what that appropriation does the value
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
of the commission is is basically to be
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board to be thinking
 
01:58:26.330 --> 01:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
bringing in the coordination of the
 
01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:30.659 align:start position:0%
communities and considering legislation
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
that we could begin Hearing in January
 
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
of 24.
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
so I understand that
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
does how does that limit the department
 
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
and how they move forward do they have
 
01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
to wait until the commission's done
 
01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
in November and issues recommendations
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
before they can start some of this work
 
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
that's the disconnect
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
they got to go this is why we had to go
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
procure this architect on one March and
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
right and and we put we just put a 30
 
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
September date to have the design
 
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
completed no later than 30 September is
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
what I said is it a different date yeah
 
01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
if I could respond to that okay how long
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
do they need for design so the the site
 
01:59:17.089 --> 01:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
review would definitely be done by that
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
based on the conversations we've had the
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
actual design work would take longer
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
than that I think the anticipated design
 
01:59:24.669 --> 01:59:24.679 align:start position:0%
process was a little closer to a year
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
so they would have so I think but I
 
01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
think that with what I've heard right
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
part of the idea is that when this
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee starts meeting in September
 
01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
you'll know the site which with the site
 
01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
evaluation worked on people will be able
 
01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
to make that decision about the site
 
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
right or at least be better informed to
 
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
make that decision about the site
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
but the full design process I don't
 
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
think will be done by September based on
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
the again DPW Public Works be the best
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
people to ask right no no I I don't
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
doubt you so Mr Ripple when I was
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
yakking earlier I said 30 September for
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
completion of
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
let's just make it the site evaluation
 
02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:05.030 align:start position:0%
let's just make it the site evaluation
recommendation

02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
okay and you could
 
02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
you could all just you could also just
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
leave it silent on a date
 
02:00:16.209 --> 02:00:16.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
I sensed that people wanted to know that
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
we were going to be making some progress
 
02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
and and with this commission having to
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
do its first report by the first in
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
November and be independent upon
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
information being provided to it by this
 
02:00:32.639 --> 02:00:34.490 align:start position:0%
information being provided to it by this
contractor

02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
02:00:37.370 --> 02:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
the contractor should have a date to
 
02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
shoot for
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
with sort of the minimum essential
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
information needed by the commission
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
so the minimum essential seems to be the
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
is 30 September adequate
 
02:00:55.370 --> 02:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
for the site evaluation I think so and I
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
you know I don't have in front of me the
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
actual scope that was proposed but I
 
02:01:01.129 --> 02:01:01.139 align:start position:0%
remember the site evaluation being like
 
02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
the very first thing and and being
 
02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
measured in like weeks or a month or so
 
02:01:06.290 --> 02:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
not measured in
 
02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
long term
 
02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay so did
 
02:01:12.890 --> 02:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
did that resolve your
 
02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
are we still confused
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I mean us are we confused I think we
 
02:01:23.089 --> 02:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
are however I just want to clarify that
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
the Commission Section
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about how
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
adding in some site-specific decision or
 
02:01:35.570 --> 02:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
suggestions I want to make sure that
 
02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
we're not holding back progress on this
 
02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:39.169 align:start position:0%
we're not holding back progress on this
side

02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:39.179 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:01:41.209 --> 02:01:41.219 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to be waiting for
 
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
a green light from the commission over
 
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
here I just wanted to make sure that all
 
02:01:46.609 --> 02:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
of this is
 
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
working together yes ma'am and there's
 
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
nothing in this commission that gives it
 
02:01:54.290 --> 02:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
Authority it they they come up with a
 
02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
recommendation and they come up with
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
um proposed legislation they don't they
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
they're not exercising a go no-go
 
02:02:07.129 --> 02:02:07.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
okay I just wanted to make sure that we
 
02:02:11.810 --> 02:02:11.820 align:start position:0%
weren't putting one ahead of the other
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they were looking at
 
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
but if you're all assuring me that's not
 
02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
the case then I will
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
put my faith in all of you no no no no
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no continue to think
 
02:02:24.169 --> 02:02:24.179 align:start position:0%
about what you're thinking and and and
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
it'll help I think to see uh a clean
 
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
copy of the walner agree I agree uh
 
02:02:34.010 --> 02:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
fresh copy yeah yeah but but don't don't
 
02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
let go of that I mean if if you think we
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
may have missed something let's not
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
we might not want to refer to site
 
02:02:49.250 --> 02:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay I'm saying there's a there shall be
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
a commission and we said that shall be
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for Community coordination
 
02:02:59.149 --> 02:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
to include aspects like law enforcement
 
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know just I wouldn't give them any
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
idea that they're selecting anything no
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
that no okay I I I I think I agree with
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
you and that's why I reread it and um
 
02:03:12.770 --> 02:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
while we were going and I'm I'm happy
 
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
that there is no Authority Beyond
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
writing a report and proposing
 
02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
legislation I also want to say that
 
02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:22.510 align:start position:0%
legislation I also want to say that
walner

02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
walner
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment here looks very different than
 
02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:27.179 align:start position:0%
walner's original Amendment so I think
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
there's it should be coming from this
 
02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
Division and not Wallner thank you
 
02:03:35.570 --> 02:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'll happily call it the division three
 
02:03:38.689 --> 02:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh after we look at it and we
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
all are okay Mr chair I just want to
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
clarify that that clarification on in
 
02:03:46.609 --> 02:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
your agreement that we're not putting
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
that site decision into the commission
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
that was solves my confusion okay
 
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:53.820 align:start position:0%
good good
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I would like to because I don't think
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're quite done yet we're very very
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
close uh I would like to close the
 
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
conversation on the proposed division
 
02:04:05.629 --> 02:04:05.639 align:start position:0%
three amendment to HB 49
 
02:04:07.550 --> 02:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say again it's going to get
 
02:04:10.129 --> 02:04:10.139 align:start position:0%
I replicated in a way in which it can be
 
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
the amendment to sb1 if that's what we
 
02:04:15.070 --> 02:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
want to do tomorrow
 
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
but Mr ribson has been teed up a couple
 
02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
of times to come talk to us about his
 
02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
numbers for what he thinks operations
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
may look like costs it's it's it's not
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
relevant to today's work session in
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
terms of producing an amendment it's
 
02:04:37.689 --> 02:04:37.699 align:start position:0%
irrelevant because I'd like to lock down
 
02:04:40.609 --> 02:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
the amendment scope that we've already
 
02:04:43.850 --> 02:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
done but but I do
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that Mr ribson can
 
02:04:48.530 --> 02:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
give us some numbers I think I think
 
02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
this is the first public review of these
 
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
numbers is that true Mr ribson yes
 
02:04:55.129 --> 02:04:55.139 align:start position:0%
that's right all right
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so this really just I mean just
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
very simple just kind of showing right
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
the biggest cost at sysc is the is the
 
02:05:05.089 --> 02:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
Personnel costs and as as we explained
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:07.729 align:start position:0%
earlier today
um

02:05:07.729 --> 02:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of those Personnel costs
 
02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
are increased based on the fact that it
 
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
essentially operates on an island
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
um and that we no longer can enjoy the
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
economies of scale that maybe were once
 
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
envisioned if you had 144 Youth and now
 
02:05:27.169 --> 02:05:27.179 align:start position:0%
you only have you know 5 12 18.
 
02:05:27.179 --> 02:05:28.490 align:start position:0%
you only have you know 5 12 18.
um

02:05:28.490 --> 02:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:31.129 align:start position:0%
pardon me
um

02:05:31.129 --> 02:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
so the idea is this is just kind of
 
02:05:35.209 --> 02:05:35.219 align:start position:0%
showing what the anticipated Personnel
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
shifts would be in a shared services
 
02:05:37.199 --> 02:05:38.810 align:start position:0%
shifts would be in a shared services
model

02:05:38.810 --> 02:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
model
 
02:05:40.250 --> 02:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and there's a couple changes here
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
right so just to show what these lines
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
are and there would be other potential
 
02:05:46.129 --> 02:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
savings or I'm jumping ahead there but
 
02:05:48.169 --> 02:05:48.179 align:start position:0%
um you know there are costs that go to
 
02:05:49.729 --> 02:05:49.739 align:start position:0%
maintaining the rest of that campus
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
right there's a lot of grass that needs
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
to be mowed there's a lot of old
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
buildings that we try to patch together
 
02:05:57.169 --> 02:05:57.179 align:start position:0%
as best that we can and keep from
 
02:05:59.209 --> 02:05:59.219 align:start position:0%
becoming dangerous
 
02:06:01.550 --> 02:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
um hazards is probably the best that we
 
02:06:03.649 --> 02:06:03.659 align:start position:0%
can do with them at this point
 
02:06:03.659 --> 02:06:04.250 align:start position:0%
can do with them at this point
um

02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:06.410 --> 02:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of cost that goes into
 
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
there there's also a lot of cost that
 
02:06:09.169 --> 02:06:09.179 align:start position:0%
just goes in the utilities of heating
 
02:06:10.970 --> 02:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
and cooling that massive building to the
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
tune of about 800 000 a year right so
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
certainly a much smaller facility would
 
02:06:17.390 --> 02:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
have smaller costs and you'd lose all
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
those other costs associated with the
 
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
campus I haven't projected those in here
 
02:06:22.669 --> 02:06:22.679 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what the next place
 
02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
is right but there would be certainly
 
02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
costs within there that are also all
 
02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
general fund Appropriations at this
 
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
point but looking at really what is the
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
bulk of the cost with the facility
 
02:06:34.070 --> 02:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
Staffing we do anticipate
 
02:06:36.169 --> 02:06:36.179 align:start position:0%
um some significant savings really to
 
02:06:38.169 --> 02:06:38.179 align:start position:0%
the tune of like I said before close to
 
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know 2 million in change in terms
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
of uh Staffing costs and that really is
 
02:06:47.689 --> 02:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
through being able to reduce some of the
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
um some of the positions and either
 
02:06:53.050 --> 02:06:53.060 align:start position:0%
sharing them with a future facility or
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
subcontracting some of that out with the
 
02:06:56.810 --> 02:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
future facility that would depend on
 
02:06:58.370 --> 02:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
whether you were co-locating with
 
02:06:59.689 --> 02:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
Hampstead or New Hampshire hospital
 
02:07:03.050 --> 02:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
right Hampstead is operated differently
 
02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire hospital and that
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
most of the services within Hampstead
 
02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
are done by contracted by a contracted
 
02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
entity whereas kind of the
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
administrative oversight is by DHHS and
 
02:07:15.890 --> 02:07:15.900 align:start position:0%
the administrators are DHHS the the
 
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:18.179 align:start position:0%
staff are primarily contracted New
 
02:07:19.729 --> 02:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital is more of a mix
 
02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
where you have a lot of State staff but
 
02:07:23.810 --> 02:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
you also have a mix of contracted staff
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
with Dartmouth
 
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
sysc today is more of a mix where we
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
have mostly State staff but we do have
 
02:07:31.370 --> 02:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
some contracted staff with Dartmouth
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
like our psychologists our part-time
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists and our clinicians and
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
recently our Educators as well
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
um so what you see here really is just
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
kind of the shift in reducing some of
 
02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
those positions that we would no longer
 
02:07:45.050 --> 02:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
need if we were in a shared services
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
model and then you add in at the bottom
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of new contracts to replace
 
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
some of those services on the model to
 
02:07:53.689 --> 02:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
the right so where you see grants for
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
public assistance that's actually the
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
education contract I don't know why it's
 
02:07:59.209 --> 02:07:59.219 align:start position:0%
called that that's in our budget the
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
line that it would have showed up in I
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't really understand those things but
 
02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
that would have been that's the
 
02:08:04.970 --> 02:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
education contract and where it says
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
contracts for program services that
 
02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
would be the contract for
 
02:08:12.169 --> 02:08:12.179 align:start position:0%
um things like uh like cleaning food and
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
things like that if this was to be say
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
at Hampstead where we were Contracting
 
02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:17.900 align:start position:0%
those Services out as a subcontract
 
02:08:20.089 --> 02:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
through their larger contract to
 
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
maintain that facility
 
02:08:24.970 --> 02:08:24.980 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to take the 64 number on
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
the on the right as as notional this is
 
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
not this is not obviously not a final
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
version of what you guys would propose
 
02:08:39.770 --> 02:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
correct um and and so I I can't help
 
02:08:42.290 --> 02:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
myself but when you you've listed a
 
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
switchboard operator you get two
 
02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
comments we don't do switchboards
 
02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:49.030 align:start position:0%
comments we don't do switchboards
anymore

02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
and and also if there is something that
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
could be shared uh with another facility
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know having somebody operate the
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
reception of the phone would be a
 
02:09:03.770 --> 02:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
candidate this switchboard Opera like
 
02:09:06.050 --> 02:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
those are just still the names that are
 
02:09:08.689 --> 02:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
classification system uses no I get it
 
02:09:11.930 --> 02:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
for administrative supports 1950s it was
 
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
a great decade so and I believe there's
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
currently an effort underway to try to
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
change all these by the end of this
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year or at least change some of
 
02:09:20.330 --> 02:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
these by the end of this fiscal year so
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
that might look different but but yeah
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
what that really is is that's the
 
02:09:24.410 --> 02:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
administrator that's kind of the
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
admission a support team
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right so again again the point
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
is let's look at sharing as much as we
 
02:09:36.850 --> 02:09:36.860 align:start position:0%
can and all right thanks do questions
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler you live out the
 
02:09:42.589 --> 02:09:42.599 align:start position:0%
teachers in the second column are we
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to be remote learning no what this
 
02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
anticipates so again that that thing
 
02:09:49.609 --> 02:09:49.619 align:start position:0%
that says grants for public assistance
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollars that
 
02:09:52.850 --> 02:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
anticipates that we contract that out
 
02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
anticipates that we contract that out
which

02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:09:55.810 --> 02:09:55.820 align:start position:0%
um actually we've already started doing
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
our Educators have retired
 
02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
and uh we entered into a contract just
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
recently with an entity called my turn
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
which does at-risk youth education in
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua and Franklin
 
02:10:13.609 --> 02:10:13.619 align:start position:0%
um and that I'm really excited about
 
02:10:15.290 --> 02:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
because you know those are also
 
02:10:16.970 --> 02:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
communities where a lot of our kids come
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
from so it'll be a nice connection
 
02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:21.109 align:start position:0%
from so it'll be a nice connection
between

02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
what they have in their Community what
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
they can get at sysc and hopefully
 
02:10:26.209 --> 02:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
facilitate better communication and
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
planning between the two operations and
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
you have several grades you have to
 
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
teach in several subjects it's it's very
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
complex and what my turn has done in
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
their other programs which we're excited
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
about is they really they already
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
operate in a model that really is more
 
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
of like an individualized learning model
 
02:10:47.209 --> 02:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
instead of a classroom based model right
 
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
and that was kind of one of the
 
02:10:51.649 --> 02:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
challenges with with our our state-run
 
02:10:53.689 --> 02:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
model was right the teachers the
 
02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:55.139 align:start position:0%
Educators they really were used to
 
02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
running a classroom based model for
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
decades right because that's what the
 
02:11:01.609 --> 02:11:01.619 align:start position:0%
facility always had and as the census
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
changed and the populations dropped and
 
02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
really any given day we have kids from
 
02:11:09.649 --> 02:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
all different age ranges and all
 
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
different learning needs that we need to
 
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
be able to individualize
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
um you know their education for and we
 
02:11:18.050 --> 02:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
would accommodate that by having a
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
teacher work with the youth on
 
02:11:21.649 --> 02:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
you know the various topics and we had
 
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
some some virtual platforms that they
 
02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
could use to supplement something called
 
02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
Plato uh like Plato and Socrates not
 
02:11:30.169 --> 02:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
like the stuff you play with
 
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and uh and the vlac system which
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
would kind of allow some additional
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
expertise to let the youth work
 
02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
one-on-one to learn what it is they need
 
02:11:39.109 --> 02:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
to learn to go back and get credit when
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
they return to their home schools
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
um so we we've been supplementing that
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
stuff but it really wasn't the it wasn't
 
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
kind of the the format and skill set
 
02:11:49.129 --> 02:11:49.139 align:start position:0%
that the historical staff were really
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
02:11:52.129 --> 02:11:52.139 align:start position:0%
um so I am excited that with this new
 
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
model we're gonna we're gonna be in a
 
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
good a good spot but it is all just just
 
02:11:59.330 --> 02:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
just brand new like literally this month
 
02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
brand new do we need that many nurses or
 
02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
is just to make sure you have 24-hour
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
coverage so what this anticipates is
 
02:12:07.609 --> 02:12:07.619 align:start position:0%
fewer nurses than than the last it still
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
anticipates that we want nurses during
 
02:12:13.129 --> 02:12:13.139 align:start position:0%
the during the awake hours but that for
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
overnights we would no longer have an on
 
02:12:16.609 --> 02:12:16.619 align:start position:0%
staff nurse
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
um currently we do keep an on staff
 
02:12:20.330 --> 02:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
nurse overnights in the case of an
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
emergency or in case of a late night
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
admission sometimes something will
 
02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
happen in the middle of the night and
 
02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
the kid shows up and we have to do one
 
02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
of the requirements under federal and
 
02:12:29.330 --> 02:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
state laws to do a physical assessment
 
02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
of every kid upon admission
 
02:12:34.970 --> 02:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
um in conversations with leadership at
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
the facilities that we'd be able to
 
02:12:38.089 --> 02:12:38.099 align:start position:0%
co-locate with both thought that you
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
know given how unusual those
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances are that that's a
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility that a staff within those
 
02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
other facilities could step in on those
 
02:12:47.209 --> 02:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstances to be able to
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
cover for us so we wouldn't have to pay
 
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
somebody to you know to basically just
 
02:12:53.450 --> 02:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
sit there just in case
 
02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:54.709 align:start position:0%
sit there just in case
um

02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:57.649 --> 02:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
and then yes of course you'll notice the
 
02:12:59.930 --> 02:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the the maintenance laundry
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
those types of things are not included
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
on the shared service model
 
02:13:06.109 --> 02:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
um right we have plenty of Need For
 
02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
Those folks there's other places in the
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
department that can absorb them whether
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's a Hampstead or um or New
 
02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital or somewhere else but
 
02:13:14.030 --> 02:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to be part of kind of
 
02:13:17.089 --> 02:13:17.099 align:start position:0%
that larger system and not not um you
 
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
know running a separate small facility
 
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh there was one other group here that
 
02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
and slipped my mind oh the kitchen staff
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
so so I would just add to this that um I
 
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's time sensitive but
 
02:13:43.010 --> 02:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
since we just set up the architect to do
 
02:13:46.490 --> 02:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
six to 12 and 12 to 18 you might need to
 
02:13:49.129 --> 02:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
be thinking the same thing about your
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
operational Staffing would would it
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
would there be any difference I assume
 
02:13:55.089 --> 02:13:55.099 align:start position:0%
it would be a tiny difference
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be relatively small
 
02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.750 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be relatively small
difference

02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
um right when even right now when we're
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
working with 12 kids or 18 kids it
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
really is a relatively small difference
 
02:14:07.850 --> 02:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
because it's really about how many units
 
02:14:09.410 --> 02:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
you have to run to keep Kids Safe I
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't expect it to be a big number but I
 
02:14:13.729 --> 02:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
I just do want us to Think Through what
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
that number is and I'll just address
 
02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
right up front I'm sure some folks look
 
02:14:19.490 --> 02:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
at that 45 youth counselor number and
 
02:14:20.930 --> 02:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
say why do you need that many for this
 
02:14:23.149 --> 02:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
few kids and I will say you know the
 
02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
lesson over the last year is that we
 
02:14:27.649 --> 02:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
still need a large pool of Frontline
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
milieu staff we might think differently
 
02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
about how we manage those folks and it's
 
02:14:32.689 --> 02:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
one of the things that might come out in
 
02:14:34.010 --> 02:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
those conversations with this committee
 
02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about the safety
 
02:14:38.089 --> 02:14:38.099 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at models that other
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
states use you know do you think about
 
02:14:42.109 --> 02:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
shifting that role right now our
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
Frontline youth counselors are our
 
02:14:46.129 --> 02:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
milieu staff they're really both
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for the primary security
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
role and the primary kind of interaction
 
02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
treatment de-escalation role and it
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
might be worth thinking about you know
 
02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
do you kind of separate some of those
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
functions out and have a smaller team of
 
02:14:58.970 --> 02:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
folks who are more focused on security
 
02:15:00.770 --> 02:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
and let your other staff be really
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
really heavily focused on your kind of
 
02:15:05.149 --> 02:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
treatment de-escalation I still think it
 
02:15:06.770 --> 02:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
would be the same number overall but it
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be kind of a different
 
02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
categorization of how you utilize your
 
02:15:11.629 --> 02:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
your Workforce all right representative
 
02:15:11.639 --> 02:15:13.189 align:start position:0%
your Workforce all right representative
Wallner

02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
Wallner
 
02:15:15.530 --> 02:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
I just I just wondered you you did just
 
02:15:17.229 --> 02:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
say that you had had some preliminary
 
02:15:19.790 --> 02:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
discussions with a couple of the
 
02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
discussions with a couple of the
locations

02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
locations
 
02:15:24.290 --> 02:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
with not not with the town folks with
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
the with the administration of the
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
facilities with the facilities yeah so
 
02:15:30.490 --> 02:15:30.500 align:start position:0%
would you have some sort of interagency
 
02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
agreement that you would have to pay I
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
mean you're going to obviously have to
 
02:15:37.609 --> 02:15:37.619 align:start position:0%
pay for food yep yeah it would have
 
02:15:39.770 --> 02:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
depending on which site it would differ
 
02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
right if it was New Hampshire hospital
 
02:15:42.530 --> 02:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
it'd really probably be kind of more
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
through the budget process and how we
 
02:15:45.290 --> 02:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
structure the budget between the two
 
02:15:47.629 --> 02:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
facilities if it was Hampstead where a
 
02:15:49.250 --> 02:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
lot of those functions are already done
 
02:15:50.689 --> 02:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
under contract it would have to be kind
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
of through a contract Amendment with the
 
02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
entity that does a lot of that work but
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
either way yeah there'd have to be a
 
02:15:58.669 --> 02:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
formal structure for that
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mooney
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
oh you were pointing over here
 
02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:04.910 align:start position:0%
oh you were pointing over here
representative

02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
02:16:10.010 --> 02:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
can you just tell us why the sununu
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
grounds is still even in the running as
 
02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.490 --> 02:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
as I said there's significant
 
02:16:22.850 --> 02:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
disadvantages to that to that site
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
that being said until we've actually
 
02:16:27.609 --> 02:16:27.619 align:start position:0%
determined that there is an adequate
 
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
piece of land parcel of land on the
 
02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
other sites you know it's hard to
 
02:16:36.169 --> 02:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
eliminate that site as a possibility and
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
that you know site selection work hasn't
 
02:16:39.650 --> 02:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
yet been completed to be sure that we
 
02:16:42.490 --> 02:16:42.500 align:start position:0%
have an appropriate physical plant site
 
02:16:45.169 --> 02:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire hospital co-location
 
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
or Hampstead co-location
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
but I think you know the current the
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
current site is you know comes with
 
02:16:59.929 --> 02:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:02.929 --> 02:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
so there's quite a cost to making that
 
02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
determination I'm just you know we've
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
been talking about this for years I'm
 
02:17:08.570 --> 02:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
just wondering why that little piece of
 
02:17:10.310 --> 02:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
the puzzle wouldn't have already been
 
02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:11.629 align:start position:0%
the puzzle wouldn't have already been
answered

02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
answered
 
02:17:13.610 --> 02:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
well that's again that's work that was
 
02:17:15.049 --> 02:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
that the intent was that you would build
 
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
that into the contract with the with the
 
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
design firm right and we've never been
 
02:17:20.690 --> 02:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
authorized to go forward to do that work
 
02:17:22.669 --> 02:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
so that was the that was kind of always
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
the plan in the intent of how this was
 
02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
going to move forward I suppose there
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
could have been another way to approach
 
02:17:29.330 --> 02:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
that but
 
02:17:31.190 --> 02:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and again I'd also point to right
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
last year we went through this whole
 
02:17:35.150 --> 02:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
process and nobody seemed to be you know
 
02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
so concerned about the site location so
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
that was just kind of a normal
 
02:17:42.349 --> 02:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
well it didn't come up at the committee
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
of conference I don't remember that
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
being even a much of a conversation even
 
02:17:49.009 --> 02:17:49.019 align:start position:0%
in division three to my memory
 
02:17:51.169 --> 02:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
it was a Hot Topic when we were talking
 
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
about the secure forensic hospital and
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
conquered sensitivities to having things
 
02:17:59.450 --> 02:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
jammed on them but but you're right I
 
02:18:01.730 --> 02:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
think you're right are there any other
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
questions so so at this point Mr Ripple
 
02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
you're the most important man in the
 
02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:07.730 align:start position:0%
you're the most important man in the
room

02:18:07.730 --> 02:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:18:11.629 --> 02:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
so so so I just want to hear you
 
02:18:14.690 --> 02:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
summarize what you think you're going to
 
02:18:17.330 --> 02:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
be doing and and then and then we'll
 
02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
foreign sure
 
02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:25.610 align:start position:0%
foreign sure
um

02:18:25.610 --> 02:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll start with the beginning
 
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
starting with Amendment 311h as a as a
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
starting point
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh the first section rather than
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
revising the dates
 
02:18:40.129 --> 02:18:40.139 align:start position:0%
will repeal section 329 of house bill 2.
 
02:18:42.589 --> 02:18:42.599 align:start position:0%
that was the part that closed the sununu
 
02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
center effective March 1st of this year
 
02:18:47.690 --> 02:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
section two of that Amendment the two
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
million dollar appropriation for design
 
02:18:51.650 --> 02:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
options will remain in with some
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
additional language stating the
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
department shall consider two design
 
02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
options one for six to twelve bed
 
02:18:59.389 --> 02:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
facility and one for 12 to 18 bed
 
02:18:59.399 --> 02:19:00.709 align:start position:0%
facility and one for 12 to 18 bed
facility

02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
there will be a date of
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
September 30th in there for the site
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation option but not for the two
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.889 --> 02:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
you will keep in
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
the section from the bill as introduced
 
02:19:20.570 --> 02:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
that appropriates 1.5 million dollars
 
02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
for operating costs for the rest of this
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
you will keep in
 
02:19:41.209 --> 02:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
part of the paragraph that's on page two
 
02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
lines three through nine
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
but you'll remove the provision about
 
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
completion of the project on or before
 
02:19:53.929 --> 02:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
also from Senate bill one
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
section 6 with various modifications one
 
02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
is in addition to
 
02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
the commission will be renamed rather
 
02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
than a public safety commission it will
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
assess the community impacts which will
 
02:20:16.010 --> 02:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
include Public Safety fire safety and
 
02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
other related factors
 
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
it will also
 
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
consider a site location
 
02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
down on lines 16 through 19 will make
 
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
sure that it contains representatives
 
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
from local law enforcement agencies and
 
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
representatives from Municipal governing
 
02:20:32.580 --> 02:20:41.050 align:start position:0%
representatives from Municipal governing
bodies

02:20:41.050 --> 02:20:41.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:47.090 --> 02:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that anything needs to
 
02:20:50.330 --> 02:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
change there although I do have a note
 
02:20:52.370 --> 02:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
about site selection so maybe that
 
02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
should specify that the preliminary
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
report will include a recommendation as
 
02:21:00.830 --> 02:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.690 --> 02:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anything else about
 
02:21:05.929 --> 02:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
so that's what I have okay and then just
 
02:21:11.090 --> 02:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
double check the repeal dates that are
 
02:21:13.450 --> 02:21:13.460 align:start position:0%
on page six just to make sure we didn't
 
02:21:15.889 --> 02:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
just missed something administratively
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
sure all right I I think that's a good
 
02:21:22.730 --> 02:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
summary did he miss anything did anyone
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
pick up on okay I think that's good
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
um Mr ribson thank you so much for your
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
patience uh the child advocate is here
 
02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
do you have any words of wisdom for us
 
02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:49.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.530 --> 02:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to share the
 
02:21:56.210 --> 02:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
importance in considering therapeutic
 
02:21:58.849 --> 02:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
components at the current facility while
 
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
the other facility is being built I know
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
that was included in Senate bill one and
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
was a very important aspect for the care
 
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
of the children that are already there
 
02:22:08.929 --> 02:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
we want to ensure that they are
 
02:22:10.490 --> 02:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
receiving the appropriate treatment so
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
I I think we heard you
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh we are not done we're going to
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
continue through the hb2 process uh and
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
and then this commission obviously is
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
still alive so all right uh anyone else
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh the our our friend in the very back
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
with the mask did you have anything to
 
02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
say to us
 
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
oh okay all right well I'd say with that
 
02:22:47.929 --> 02:22:47.939 align:start position:0%
division three work session is adjourned
 
02:22:47.939 --> 02:22:49.130 align:start position:0%
division three work session is adjourned
yeah

02:22:49.130 --> 02:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
well until the next one which is
 
02:22:55.010 --> 02:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
tomorrow right after full Finance
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
but that's a separate distinct work
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
session so
 
02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
all right so this work session I think
 
02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
is done
 
02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
I think
