00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh good morning um members of the
 
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
committee before we start the hearing uh
 
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
hearings for the day just a couple of
 
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
well more than a couple of remarks from
 
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
my end of the the room I think we did
 
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
well our first year um assignment to
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
this committee has often been requested
 
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
by people who have had bad experiences
 
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
with the court and have come to
 
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
conquered loaded for bear that usually
 
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't work it's not worked well in the
 
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
past because others are out in the field
 
00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
with their guns and sometimes they shoot
 
00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
back at you and not only that some of
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
the Bears you're loaded for also are
 
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
armed I could make a pun about bearing
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
arms and arming bears but I won't so my
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
goal was to get us to work together
 
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
wherever possible by ganging up against
 
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
problems and not ganging up against
 
00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 align:start position:0%
others and sometimes circles get squared
 
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
and when not we still disagreed without
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
being disagreeable most of the
 
00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
time some of you first termers have
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
probably started a file now entitled
 
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
great speeches I never had to give
 
00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 align:start position:0%
because you were ready for things that
 
00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
didn't get pulled off consent and it was
 
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
voted in with a lot of other things and
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
you had a great speech ready um some of
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
us have a thick file of those don't we
 
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.110 align:start position:0%
us have a thick file of those don't we
yes

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
yes uh this year we're going to have to
 
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
work quickly because we have a lot of
 
00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 align:start position:0%
bills including some that will likely
 
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
have hearings that will go from 1 in the
 
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon until who knows when so if
 
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
you've got a real question that no one
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
else has raised raise it but give it
 
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
briefly and if the subject has been
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
covered it does not need to be covered
 
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
again um it's not encouraged for you or
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
I to repeat what somebody else has said
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
and it's generally the policy for us not
 
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
to give
 
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
speeches during hearings but instead ask
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
brief questions they need to be
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
questions not speeches is disguised as
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
questions now I tend to be broader in my
 
00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that rule because I'm
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
probably one of the flagrant disobey of
 
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
it but there's a point so we all have to
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
watch ourselves on making sure a
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
question of somebody testifying is RAR a
 
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
question we will start at 9:30 except
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
for those Tuesdays where there is a
 
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
Tuesday morning meeting for chairs and
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
vice chairs at which point we will start
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
at 9:45 or 10
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
plan on possibly going until
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
4 now there may be a few hearings that
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
may go on beyond that and you will
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
discover if you haven't already that a
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
lot of what people sign up to say has
 
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 align:start position:0%
been said many times they have a right
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
to say it we have a right to think I've
 
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
heard this a lot I've already pretty
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
well figured up my what I'm going to do
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
I will schedule things more tightly
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
um because we got to get things done and
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
I don't want to have to meet a second
 
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
day each week when I first came into the
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
house the committee I was part of had
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
about as many bills as we did last year
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
and we met twice a week it was a very
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
very loose schedule I would prefer to do
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
what we did last year and move as
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can um without rushing you
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
know I mean we can be On
 
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 align:start position:0%
Target at the end of a hearing unless
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's already obvious I will take a straw
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
pole of the committee that's a pseudo
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
vote that doesn't count and it will give
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
us a sense of what we could do next if
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
it looks like we are in total agreement
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
or almost like 15 to one we'll exec the
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
bill right then and there and vote
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
accordingly ought to pass in expedient
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
to legislate and send it off to the
 
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
consent calendar the speaker wants stuff
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
sent out quickly or secondly if it looks
 
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
like we're not in agreement and nobody
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
thinks we can really fix the bill by
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
working and working and working on it we
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
will hold the bill until an executive
 
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 align:start position:0%
session I'm planning one for the morning
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
of January 30th and there'll be more of
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
these or thirdly if if it looks like
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
we're not in agreement but we think we
 
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
could come to agreement we could get
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
that Circle squared if the bill got
 
00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
worked on I'll hold the bill and ask
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
three or four people to go craft an
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
amendment we can all live with and bring
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
it back to the exec session the three or
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
four of you could either be a formal
 
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:50.919 align:start position:0%
work session and that will have to be
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
noted in the calendar or you might one
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
individual might decide to craft an
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
amendment on your own after having
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
discussed it informally with others keep
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
me in the loop the fourth thing we could
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
do is vote interim
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
study there's no vote for retained bills
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the second year because remember
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
retained bills from last year got voted
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
on last week well last week next year is
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
a new house the election is taking place
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
so there's no retain bills but interim
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
study means a workg group meets to
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
discuss the bill and makes one of two
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations only a good idea for
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
future legislation or not a good idea
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
for future legislation I personally have
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
never favored the interim study
 
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
route early bills these are bills that
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
have to go to another committee they
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
must be out the door by February 15th
 
00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
our last meeting before then is February
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
13th the Tuesday which means they're
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
batting first pretty much here because
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
if we want to Tinker with them we'll
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
have to do that because the final vote
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
has to be out by the middle of February
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
we will not meet on February 27th that
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire school vacation week
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
there is no session it's been announced
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
several times some committee chairs go
 
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
ahead and make committee meetings I
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
don't do that you're getting the week
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
off with your kids or grandkids in
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
enjoy finally no food or drink in the
 
00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
room except water that means you can't
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
have your lunch here if you brought your
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
lunch you got to go down to the
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
cafeteria or somewhere outside of a
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
meeting room uh people again ask what to
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman hello
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
representative I just have a question um
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
I know that sometimes people are unable
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
to attend committee for the entire day
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
so um I completely understand your your
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
scheduling um and all of the process
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that you just said um just curious if
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
someone would need to leave early for an
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
whatever reason um would we ask to have
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
a replacement for us for the entire
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
day Replacements are for the day not for
 
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
after 3 o'clock so because oh I'm sorry
 
00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
can I follow up I'm sorry about that
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so um because we
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
will be having testimony and then
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
possibly exacting some bills then that
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
would just be the general course what we
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
would do we will exec them only if it
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
looks like it's going to be unanimous
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
where one or two people's absence
 
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference like we've
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
got a few people who can't be here today
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
and that's why if it was a controversial
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
Bill well I'm not going to execute
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
because it's not fair we didn't give the
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a replacement to come in
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
only if it looks like it's unanimous
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
because the absence of somebody won't
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
make any difference in terms of the vote
 
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:53.079 align:start position:0%
okay try to be fair any other questions
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
before we get
 
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.910 align:start position:0%
before we get
going

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to open the hearing on
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%

you thank you Mr chairman and members of
the

00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
committee before I start with 1189 I
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
want to give a heartfelt thank you to
 
00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:52.839 align:start position:0%
you all for working so hard on HB 618 FN
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
which with your help after you retained
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
it uh was able to go onto the consent
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
calendar in pass last week I think it's
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
great that we're going to be letting
 
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
people know what their right is to work
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
together to handle their child support
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
when they have their final divorce
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
decree um and not involve garnishment in
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
the state um anytime people are informed
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
of their rights I think it's a good
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
thing HB 1189 I bring before you because
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh I had both bills I bring before you
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
now are going to look familiar because
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
they both were in front of you last year
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh HB 1189 was not passed last year uh
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
well the pre predecessor to it um in
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
that one we had tried to fix a situation
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
where I personally was denied a passport
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
renewal because my wage garnishment
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't line up with the payment
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
schedule that DCF was expecting um and
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh or Child Support Services was uh
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
expecting and when the request for the
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh passport was put down from the
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
Department of State in the federal
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
government it came back with a no from
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because I was between $3
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
and $6 under what the total should have
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
been so we tried in the last bill to put
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount that would be the lowest
 
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
amount that someone could be in a re for
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
one month just to make sure or for one
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
payment sorry not one month one payment
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh since the payments are done weekly
 
00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519 align:start position:0%
and I think it was around $20 or
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
something something and we were argued
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
against that uh the opposition from the
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
Department um said that we already
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
follow federal guidelines for reporting
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
for the passport denial you'll see in
 
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
the handout I sent out on the second
 
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.509 align:start position:0%
the handout I sent out on the second
page

00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
um halfway down it says under the
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
passport denial program it states uh
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
certify cases in which an obligor owes
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
more than $2,500 in unpaid child support
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
the office of Child Support Enforcement
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
transmits the information to the
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
Department of State so that a US
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
passport will not be issued renewed or
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
someone is not uh to someone who's not
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
supporting their children now obviously
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
I was not $2500 in AAR I've never been
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
$500 in AAR but somehow my passport got
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
denied so there's a problem but the
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
department said they never report it to
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government unless it exceeds
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
that amount so I said fine if
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
that's what you're saying then I'm going
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
to put a bill in that says You must
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
follow the federal guidelines and in
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
addition the other problem when I called
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of State to find out
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
why my passport was being denied they
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
said well we can't see the dollar amount
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
you're inter for New Hampshire doesn't
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
report the dollar amount to us they only
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
tell us yes or no they're either in
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
they've either paid the amount they're
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
supposed to or more or they're in a rear
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say what the dollar
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
amount is so part of this bill says they
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
must report back with the dollar amount
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
when they make that
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
report uh other states do report dollar
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
amounts New Hampshire does not so it's a
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
fairly simple bill you have seen it
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
before this iteration of it simply says
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll read it to you the
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
department shall maintain an automated
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
system of reporting child support aages
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
that complies with the federal
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines on child support
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
delinquency and that means if those
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines change we'll still stay
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
aligned with them which means that we
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to revisit this that's why I
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
wrote it that way and shall not report
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
as delinquent any aage that does not
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
meet the th Federal threshold this gives
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
us the ability to come back and say why
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
did you report it when you said that you
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
weren't going to and now you're in
 
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
violation of state law the system shall
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
also report the request to the
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
requesting agency the dollar amount of
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
the aage if the account is delinquent
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
and that will allow the Department of
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
State to look at it and say this isn't
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
more than $22,500
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as that that and I'm open
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
any representative Raymond I can see
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
your hand all right thank you Mr
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
for coming um I have a question about
 
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:15.630 align:start position:0%
for coming um I have a question about
the

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
um the line 10 where it says shall not
 
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839 align:start position:0%
report as delinquent any a rear rage
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
that does not meet the federal threshold
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
does this bill um mean that they can't
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
report it to anyone or is it only
 
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for the federal government
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
for the passport program because I know
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
in both the handout you gave and then
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
the our research handout um it talked
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
about how um child support sometimes
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
reports to you know collection agencies
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
they report to Driver's Licenses um and
 
00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:46.630 align:start position:0%
they report to Driver's Licenses um and
that

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
threshold um seems to be different in
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
different circumstances so I'm curious
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
about whether this bill would prohibit
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
them from going to collection agencies
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
as well so by tying it to the federal
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
threshold that means whichever Federal
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
threshold you're talking about it should
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
have to align with that so if the
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
thresholds different for driver's
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
licenses that's the threshold that they
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
have to meet uh it's not specifically
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
saying a dollar amount here and it's not
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
specifically saying this is you know it
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
has to be $2,500 it's saying the federal
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
threshold so for any agency they report
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
to whatever the threshold might be now
 
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
if a collection agency or a credit hero
 
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a threshold then the
 
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.390 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a threshold then the
threshold

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
zero if a driver's license has a a
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
person has a threshold of of a smaller
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
amount than $2,500 then that becomes the
 
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
threshold for reporting we're saying You
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
must align yourself for reporting with
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the federal threshold is
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
because that's what they said they do
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to try to hold them
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
to that but in addition I want the
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
dollar amount reported when that report
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
is made which is currently not being
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.909 align:start position:0%
is made which is currently not being
done

00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question oh you
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
haven't taken it yet but um it looks
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
like you're trying to uh put a check on
 
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
the system in other words you you said
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's an up or a down but this says when
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
you get the number figure that helps
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
them understand if there was an error
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
correct okay and the Department of State
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
told me that they could not override it
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know the dollar
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
amount so they couldn't finish
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
processing my passport if it was in
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
error because they didn't know the
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
dollar amount so I had to actually work
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
with the state pay them five or6 dollar
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
to get it to zero and tell the Federal
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
Department of State again now run your
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
check and please do it before the next
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
processing time because then it might
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
fall in misalignment again um and I can
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
for anybody who wants to see
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's personal information so I don't
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
want to just throw it out there but I
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
can print out how my uh deductions from
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
my pay equal out throughout the year I
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
get paid every two
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
weeks the Bureau of Child Support
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
Services expects a payment
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
weekly so at certain times in the year
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
I'm in a rears at certain times I might
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
be slightly above by the end of the year
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
it equals zero because the way the work
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
calculates that they say here's the
 
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
amount he needs to pay at the end of the
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
year let's divide that over all these
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
pay periods of every two
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
weeks and then that's what they take out
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
of my
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
paycheck unfortunately since I'm not
 
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
paid weekly it doesn't line up exactly
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
with the payments and that's why I'm in
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
this situation and I'm sure that anybody
 
00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:48.919 align:start position:0%
who's paid in other ways it misaligns as
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
well so um I could show you how halfway
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
through the year I'm always in AAR when
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
I add those up but by December It lines
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
up again it's just just because of the
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
way that those payments hit on various
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
months that have various pay periods in
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
them every month doesn't have two um and
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
it's just you
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
you I see no further
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%

state of New Hampshire um and I am here
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
today just to provide some information
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
in relation to House Bill
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
1189 um it was unclear to the department
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh specifically what uh this proposed
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
legislation was in fact seeking to
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
accomplish um up until hearing um
 
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative Spain speak to the intent
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
behind the bill this morning um so I
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
just speak uh to this briefly um you
 
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
know the department uh takes the
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
position that we are already uh in
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
compliance with the title 4D uh
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements for Federal
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
collections uh the code of federal
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
regulations under the title
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
4D um Act is uh pretty prescriptive in
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
terms of uh ensuring that we have
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
federally certified automated systems to
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
which I will speak to our New Hampshire
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh automated system is a federally
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
certified system um that um already has
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
programmed in all of the programmatic uh
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
requirements that our federal
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
collections programs uh requests for us
 
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.510 align:start position:0%
collections programs uh requests for us
to

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
submit um to um both the federal offset
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
and the federal passport denial program
 
00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.350 align:start position:0%
and the federal passport denial program
um

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
so um again um want to assure the
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
committee that the uh current system
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire has in
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
place uh for child support services
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
meets all of the very specific
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
regulations um specifically uh outlined
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
in the code of federal regulations um
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
307 um and
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the specific guidance that our
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
federal office of Child Support Services
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
Division of federal systems provides to
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
us uh for technical guidance um so in
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh as it was spoken to the
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
division of federal systems provides
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
states with very specific technical
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
guidelines and data elements to which we
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
are required to provide uh for both the
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
federal collections offset program as
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
well as a passport program to meet the
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
eligibility thresholds um at time
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
certain and um we are currently uh in
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
compliance with that um so I would be um
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
happy and available um one of the data
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
elements that we do provide within our
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
data file is the aage amount um the
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
federal threshold for uh eligibility for
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
um passport denial is um uh an
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
individual's a reage amount in order to
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
be included in that file must
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrate uh an amount of $2500 or
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
more um the federal threshold um and
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
that indicator is then uh sent within
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
the data file that we send to the
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
federal office of Child Support
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
Services um so with that I will just uh
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
want to again just reassure the
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
committee um that our system is already
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
in compliance with these rules we are a
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
federally certified system um and
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
certainly if there were
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
um any questions that the committee may
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
have I would be uh happy to answer them
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%

Simon thank you Mr chairman and thank

you for taking my
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
question I I full disclosure I am a uh
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill um my question
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
to you is uh since it it is your
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
statement that you are in full
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
compliance this bill will not change
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
true again as I stated rep thank you
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative ton I appreciate the
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
question um again currently we are uh
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
responsible to providing the federal
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
government with the data elements that
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
they uh ask us to do and we are
 
00:26:56.909 --> 00:26:56.919 align:start position:0%
currently in um uh performance with that
 
00:26:56.919 --> 00:26:59.549 align:start position:0%
currently in um uh performance with that
so

00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
um if I don't see that
 
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.750 align:start position:0%
um if I don't see that
this

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
um since we're already in compliance
 
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
with our automated system as prescribed
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
by the federal government um I don't uh
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
I I would be concerned that we would be
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
um uh again the federal government is
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
the entity the office of uh Child
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
Support Services is the entity that
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
requires tells us what to report to them
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
so I certainly would want the department
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we maintained uh
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
compliance with whatever they requested
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
us to provide for data elements uh for
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
their system
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
processing I'd like to give the followup
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%

any arage um as it pertains
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
to as it my understanding is has it
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
pertains to the federal request only is
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
that yours does this affect any other
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
reporting of a
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
reage within your agency not necessarily
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
to the feds does this bill change any of
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
that language or do you or are you
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
seeing this as as it pertains to the
 
00:29:12.919 --> 00:29:14.750 align:start position:0%
seeing this as as it pertains to the
federal

request thank you representative long
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
for the question um the way that it is
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
written speaks specifically to Federal
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
thresholds um that is how I would
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
receive that information would be
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
specific to Federal threshold that is
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
certainly how representative Spain spoke
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and one more one more uh with
 
00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:44.919 align:start position:0%
respect to data
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
elements the feds request information
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
you give them information somebody's
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
$1,000 behind on a
 
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.789 align:start position:0%
$1,000 behind on a
rage

00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
um now through testimony uh it was
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
stated that it was a minimum amount owed
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh however they went after their
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
passport um and that's out of your hands
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%

passports for under the
$2500

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
$2500
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
minimal thank you for the question
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative long um I am not aware of
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
any of those circumstances that you uh
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
referenced I would like to clarify if I
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
could that um the file in which we the
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
bureau sends to the federal
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
collections um office uh is there there
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
are several Federal thresholds depending
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
upon the federal enforcement remedy uh
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we submit to in this particular
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance um a file is sent routinely
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
to the office of Child Support uh
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
Services federal office of Child Support
 
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.950 align:start position:0%
Services federal office of Child Support
Services

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
wherein uh cases that meet the federal
 
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
threshold for federal tax refund offset
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
the federal thresholds for eligibility
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
for aages in those cases are in
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances where Public Assistance
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
arear or also known as tanif arear um
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
$150 in AAR at the end of the um at the
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
time of submission and in nonpublic
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
assistance also known as non- tanif
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
aages that is a five $500 Federal
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
threshold so when a case meets that
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria that file is sent
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
with that amount that amount will change
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
based on what the aage amount of the
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
case is in a passport denial situation
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
with the federal passport denial program
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
again I just want to clarify that that
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
threshold is 25 00 or more so that will
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
only that indication will only go to the
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
passport Deni program when that
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
particular case meets that aage
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
balance I would like to clarify though
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
that once you are once a file is
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
submitted to the federal passport denial
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
program it is not automatically
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
removed from the Federal passport denial
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
program the individual that was
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
submitted must then work with the state
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
agency uh to that submitted them to
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
remove that indicator from their
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
passport denial or from their passport
 
00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:18.909 align:start position:0%
passport denial or from their passport
um

00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
status um once the aage balance for that
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
in uh case reaches zero
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
in the federal passport denial program
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
the indicator is automatically removed
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
and if there are circumstances where
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
there may be discrepancies the state can
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
work with the office of Child Support
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
Services and the passport denial program
 
00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
to assist an individual to address uh
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
any potential lag or concerns in
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
indication okay thank you thank you

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
on the bill would you recommend that we
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
passed this bill or would you recommend
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
that we um itl
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Gibbons
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's yes I'm changing my name but yes
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's in the process uh representative
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
Gibbons for uh the question again um you
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
know the department uh takes yes a
 
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.430 align:start position:0%
know the department uh takes yes a
neutral

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint um as to whether uh the
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
committee um chooses to pass this bill
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
or not I just want to assure um the
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
committee that we are
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
currently um in compliance with what we
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
are regulated to provide as prescribed
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
under the title 4D program here for the
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
state New
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Greg thank you
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for being here
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
and for taking our questions we
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I just in going back to
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know it it comes down to this is
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
kind of a neutral thing but if process
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
is already being done the necessity to
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
legislate something such as this when I
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that we've had an
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
overwhelming um number of them but back
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
to the root of this if uh somebody who's
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
paying child support is having it it
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
seems like if if this is the way that it
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
is where it gets paid every week but the
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
individual only gets paid every two
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
weeks then it's a system where it's set
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
up for them to be in AAR aages um is
 
00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
there is there a way for them to adjust
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
that like if they get paid every two
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
weeks I mean obviously the person with
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
the child the bulk of the time has the
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
expenses all the time they don't have
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
you know expenses only every two weeks
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
but is there a way to combat that so
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we're not setting somebody up for
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
failure in a rear
 
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
edes thank you representative Greg for
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
the question um the answer is is that e
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
each case is taken into consideration on
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
its own merits every case situation uh
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
fluctuates differently uh so our case
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
workers um are trained to look at the
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
nuances of particular case circumstances
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
to determine if there are circumstances
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
where there may be
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
um uh timing concerns in relation to the
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
amounts of the obligation versus the the
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
time of the payments so we do to um have
 
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
procedures in place that our case
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
workers will look specifically at those
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
types of circumstances to ensure that if
 
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
there are any manual exclusions that
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
need to be placed uh on the case uh
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
record that that can be done
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
so you want to follow up followup thank
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
you for the followup so just to make it
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
clear then if there there is a way to do
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
this so you're not set up to constantly
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
have Rees every year there is a process
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
where you can fix this correct thank you
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
again representative cig for the
 
00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
question uh yes there are circumstances
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
where uh our case workers will look at
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
individual case circumstances and
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not any types of um
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
exclusions may need to be placed as
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
prescribed by the uh guidance that we've
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
programs representative
 
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
ball thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I actually
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
have two now because I wanted to follow
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
up on that question do the um people in
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
the department look at the situations
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
the individual St in situations before
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
or after the situation occurs in other
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
words do you already have um you you
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm asking sorry thank
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
you representative ball for the question
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's a continuous review process our
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
case workers are are constantly uh
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the uh case circumstances
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
right at the onset of the case when
 
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
we're putting our orders on the system
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
and when they are passed to our child
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
support enforcement officers for review
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
and maintenance so we routinely look at
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
cases and are triggered to look at cases
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
at a variety of different um uh uh
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
junctures throughout the case so it's a
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
continuous re view but yes there are
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances where we receive Direct
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
Communications from our constituents who
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
are asking us to look at certain
 
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances to which we will also do
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
at that same time follow follow up and
 
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
before I would ask the witness please to
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
be brief her in her words we don't need
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
long drawn out answers that can be as a
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
given in one word or one phrase please
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative ball thank you chairman
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you again um so the question I
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
now have is is I'm understanding you to
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
say that the federal to be in federal
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
compliance you report if it's $2,500 a
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
reage to the
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
passport but if it falls below the 2500
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
why is it still being reported because
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's no longer meeting that threshold
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not understanding why it would stay
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
on um as being a a
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
flag thank you representative ball so to
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
be submitted for the federal passport
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
program the aage balance has is
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
triggered by the $2500 aage so once your
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
aares meet $2500 or more if you're
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
submitted within the file you're
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
submitted to the passport denial program
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
so it's an eligibility
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
criteria but when it falls below that
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
when the next payment comes in why is it
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
still remaining that's that's the the
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
point so when he got down to $3 to5
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
dollar because of the twoe um pay period
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
um why wasn't it removed at that time
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
because it know no longer met that
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
criteria or the threshold I should say
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ball the
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures in relation to
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
the federal passport denial program uh
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
indicates that the uh once submitted to
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
the passport denial program the
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
individual must reach out to the state
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
agency to uh have that removed because
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
in order to be removed from passport
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
denial your rear balance has to equal
 
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.109 align:start position:0%
denial your rear balance has to equal
zero

00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the federal policies
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you chairman for taking
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
allowing me to have question um and
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if the
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
requirement is
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
$2500 in the rare to be put into the
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
passport denial program and if
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative SP only was in the rears
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
$5 is and you're say telling us that
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
everybody in your agency is following
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
the guidelines is there a
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
possibility that there was
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
a data breach a computer hack that would
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
list thank you for the question
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative Panic um I'm not quite
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
sure how I can answer that question
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
question um I would say uh no uh I'm I'm
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
not aware of any concerns related to
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
that um and I don't know that that would
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
be a circumstance however
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
no thank you the question the answering
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
all right my question thank you for
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
taking it if I understand representative
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
Spain's not only testimony today but
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
last year that he was in a rage a very
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
small amount and that the feds did not
 
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
know how
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
much where is the problem is it his
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
faulty memory is it what you did or did
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
not send or is it the feds can't figure
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
out what you appropriately did send
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
here thank you representative Pearson
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
for the question um I think it's a uh I
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
think the problem lies in understanding
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
how the data flow Works between the
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
state the federal office of Child
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
Support Enforcement and how that
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
information then gets transmitted to the
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
Department of State for the passport
 
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.230 align:start position:0%
Department of State for the passport
denial

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
denial
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
program the state agency submits the
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
files for aares and federal thresholds
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
to the office of Child Support
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Services the office of Child
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
Support Enforcement Services then sends
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
an indicator to the Department of State
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
that handles the passport program that
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
an individual had met the threshold but
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
they I don't believe send to the
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
Department of State the aage
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
amount that is maintained between the
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
office of Child Support Enforcement
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
services and the State Child Support
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
Agency so it could be in fact and um I
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
don't have those specific details of
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
data elements in front of me but that
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
could be that the department of the US
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
Department of State that handles the
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
passport process just know knows that
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
the child support program has submitted
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
an individual for the passport denial
 
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
program and then they ask the individual
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
to return to the state agency that
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
field any other questions yes
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative ball thank you chairman
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
Pearson and just one last question um I
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know when these um
 
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
notices of a rear ages go to other
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
agencies do the people who are in AAR
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
are they also made aware that the other
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
agencies have been been told that they
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
are in AAR in other words if somebody's
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
applying for a passport would they know
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
that they could have corrected this
 
00:45:47.309 --> 00:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
beforehand or that there's going to be
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
an issue or is this something that after
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
six weeks of waiting for their passport
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
they then find out oh my God I have to
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
pay $5 and then we got to go go through
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
the whole process over again when do the
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
people find out that their name has been
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
submitted into an agency um because of
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
aages thank you representative ball uh
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support Services
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
does provide notices and uh information
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
to our uh obligor that are paying child
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
support services the federal offset
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
program also sends out a
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
pre-offer collections a reage amount and
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
you've been submitted to the program you
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
will receive that initial notice as well
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
as an annual notice to be informed of
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman so if in
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
the individual's case where the
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
individual was not in a rear of
 
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
$2500 or
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
more which did not
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
meet the federal requirement would that
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
that person receive a notice of a
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
reement a reage as well because the
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
person that we're discussing did not
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
receive such
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
notice thank
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative deimon for
 
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
the question if I understand the
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
question that you're asking um anytime
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
an individual within our program is
 
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
being um submitted or if any enforcement
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
action is being taken uh within our
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
Authority the individual is provided
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
notice uh our program does require us to
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
send multiple notices uh more than one
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
time in some circumstances to try to
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
engage with individuals again I cannot
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
speak to specific case circumstances
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
naturally um every case is taken uh you
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
know that facts of each case is taken
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
into consideration so uh but on a
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
general basis again we absolutely notice
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
our uh customers of any and all actions
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
that were taken in their cases at a
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
variety of different times throughout
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
welcome Vice chair long thank you Mr
 
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.230 align:start position:0%
welcome Vice chair long thank you Mr
chairman

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh would your Bureau be able to look at
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
those that go in a reage knowing that in
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
December in their payment plan they're
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
going to be paid in full and not have to
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
submit those to the
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
feds thank you so in this case it was a
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
reage because of the monthly payments uh
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
and I think why would that have to be
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
reported to the feds if in December I
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be paid
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
for thank you representative long I
 
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
believe the short answer is yes we could
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh pre-identify cases that would be um
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh approaching um uh collection uh you
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
know uh approaching a full obligation um
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
you seeing nothing further thank you for
 
00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:20.839 align:start position:0%
your testimony the chair
 
00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh The Honorable Betty gay
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
she asks for three minutes we're running
 
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
minutes representative Spain was never
 
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.349 align:start position:0%
minutes representative Spain was never
in

00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
$2500 a
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
reage that shows that there is a problem
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
with the system it sounds like a
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
software problem because as
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
representative Greg pointed out all only
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
in weeks only in weeks that end on the
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
weekend are a payment going to match a
 
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.109 align:start position:0%
weekend are a payment going to match a
whole

00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
week everybody is going to be in a reage
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
every week not
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
$2500 but they will be in a reage if
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
this software is not uh modified so um I
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
think this bill will cover for that
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
builtin reage by requiring the reage
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
amount to be input only if the software
 
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
$2500 I'm going to gather as a person
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
with a technical bachelors's that it's
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
always a good idea to have the real
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
numbers somewhere stored in the data so
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to ask a question
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
about it from another angle they've got
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
it there for instance when uh when when
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative Spain was trying to deal
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
with the federal government to free up
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
his right to have a a
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
passport apparently nobody ever
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
discussed a reage amounts and if this is
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
an automated system then the automated
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
system has to get fixed otherwise it was
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
verbal and they never asked how much
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
he's in a reage they just said is he in
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
reage they said yes so we can fix it we
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
can fix the software or we can just
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
require that the amount is always
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
available to be considered when the
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
question is asked but again if it's an
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
automated system my opinion is the
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
software has got to get fixed or people
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
are going to be in a reage almost 52
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
weeks a
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
year any qu any questions for The
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
Honorable Betty gay any thank you for
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you I'd like to ask
 
00:51:58.829 --> 00:51:58.839 align:start position:0%
a question of Representative Spain
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
please before I do a polling of the
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
committee to see whether we want to
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
exact this bill as
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
presented having heard chairman having
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
heard the
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
testimony might this committee wish to
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
consider an amendment that would add
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
some toughening language to what we have
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
in front of us because the longer I
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
heard the assertions of how we so
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
frequently review the case how we are so
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
careful in doing this and yet here is
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
the problem there is a problem and it is
 
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
your problem because of someone else's
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
problem do you think it would be
 
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
advantageous to what we're trying to do
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
to um perhaps have an amendment to
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
toughen this bill Mr chairman there
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
there appeared to me to be some areas
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
that make obvious some of the holes in
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
the system during the
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that may not be addressed
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
by the bill as it's written so you may
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
want to consider that for example I can
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
tell you that um in the testimony I
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
heard that notice is given to the person
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
that they can correct it before they
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
apply for their passport renewal if they
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
exceed the
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
threshold in my case where I didn't
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
exceed the thresold and I don't know how
 
00:53:22.109 --> 00:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
it got triggered into that system I
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
never received notice and I actually had
 
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
to send my passport back back to them
 
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
with the payment that passport was no
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
longer in my possession so even though
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
it was good for six more months I still
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
was banned from traveling waiting six
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
weeks for their reply and when their
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
reply came and said now you're in a
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
rears you need to talk to them I had to
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
trigger calling the SEC the Department
 
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
of State then calling the the Bureau of
 
00:53:46.109 --> 00:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services here in the State
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what happened I had
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
to actually uh pay the $5 or so to the
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Child Support Services then
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
wait 20 24 hours so that it would be
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
processed by their system and then tell
 
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
the secret Department of State please
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
process it again now because it should
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
be zero
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
now and none of this should have
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
happened um in addition I heard that
 
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
while we review these cases for special
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
situations it doesn't but yet the
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
software is automated so whatever
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
triggered the software and sent the
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
notice out happened before they may have
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed the case the cases are not
 
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
being reviewed prior to it doesn't say
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
all right here's a trigger now let's
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
look at that before it gets sent because
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
it's automated so what's happening is
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's being triggered and sent
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
automatically and then if there's a
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
problem they'll review it but every
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
single one of these
 
00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:43.799 align:start position:0%
triggers because of the situation
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
they're in where more and more people
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
are being paid not on a weekly basis I
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
think there's probably a lot more people
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
than me that may be hitting these
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
thresholds maybe they didn't apply for a
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
passport port and they didn't realize it
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
and things zeroed out again but it's
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
going to happen again and it's going to
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
happen again because these triggers
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
should be reviewed or the software
 
00:55:08.349 --> 00:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
fixed would you like to work with one or
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
two of us in this committee on a
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
possible amendment to be brought forth
 
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
by say January 30th our exec session I
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
would be happy to I see a question for
 
00:55:27.789 --> 00:55:27.799 align:start position:0%
you though yeah and it's it's not a
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
question as much as it's a statement uh
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
that's going to try to look like a
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
question that um violates what I read
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
earlier um that since the department has
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
stipulated all the good
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
things but they didn't
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
happen for
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
us articulate them is not an insult in
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
the slightest because they maintain
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
they're doing it so we're just asking
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
them to do things they they're already
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
doing right in their opinion that's why
 
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
I drafted the bill the way it
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
is but yet it looks like it may need a
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
00:56:06.599 --> 00:56:08.950 align:start position:0%
little bit more
teeth

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
teeth
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps yes
 
00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:14.270 align:start position:0%
perhaps yes
representative

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
Rosman thank you Mr
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just a little concerned that
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
we're legislating to a specific case
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have other cases of
 
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
people coming forward we haven't had any
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
other cases come forward with this
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
problem it's up to the individual that
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
gets into aers to follow up with the
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
passport that's the trigger even if it's
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
at $3 but at some point it triggered to
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
go into AAR so the only person we've had
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
coming forward is representative Spain
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm really uncomfortable with
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislating this way okay thank you
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
comment okay that will conclude this
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time hearing and I
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
will not move this to exec and uh you
 
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
can be in touch if you wish with one or
 
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
two people if you wish and that is our
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
right to do so this ends the hearing on
 
00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:21.950 align:start position:0%
right to do so this ends the hearing on
Bill

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
1189 and we now open the hearing on Bill
 
00:57:32.029 --> 00:57:32.039 align:start position:0%
1111 and it is the penalty for false
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
reports of suspected abuse and neglect
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
made to
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
DCF and the chair recognizes the prime
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.799 --> 00:57:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
Spain

00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee this bill will look very
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
familiar because this is the exact same
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
bill that you passed out of this
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee and we passed out of the house
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
and sent over to the Senate last
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
year uh the Senate decided uh the the
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
chair of the senate committee decided
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
that uh she was going to interim study
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
it um I will tell you that I had two
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
different phone calls from the chair of
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
the committee asking me questions
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
I spoke to the governor about the bill
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
and he was in support of the bill I
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
spoke to the department and they were in
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
support of the bill in fact the old
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
director of DCF helped me draft the
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
language of that bill which is why we
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
passed this out in the exact same
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
language you're seeing before you now
 
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.430 align:start position:0%
language you're seeing before you now
last

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
year my intent is to put this in front
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
of the Senate
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
again because I'm going to uh keep
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
pushing them to try to to stop
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
especially with all of the news lately
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
about the the lack of resources for dcyf
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
to stop allowing people to weaponize the
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
system with false reports and and give
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
people a free get out of jail card so
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to do anything at
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
all for making a knowingly false report
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
I believe our bar was very high when we
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
passed this out of the house we said not
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
only does it have to be knowingly false
 
00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
but it has to be done with intent to
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
harm it's a very high bar it Exempted
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
all mandatory
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
reporters and uh I I passed around as
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see a uh
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
reminder that approximately 28 states
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
carry penalties in their civil child
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
protection laws for a person who
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
willfully or intentionally makes a
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
report of child abuse or neglect that
 
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
the reporter knows to be false we're not
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
breaking new ground of those 28 States
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
states such as New York Massachusetts
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
California all have this law it's it's
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
not a a freebie to go ahead and make
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
false false reports of child abuse or
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
neglect against people it's not uh
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
something that comes without penalty if
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
you're chewing up DCF resources for
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
false complaints our DCF department is
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
understaffed and has enough to do they
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
don't need to be chasing down false
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
reports constantly from people who just
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
have a beef with somebody and the
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
department should be able to Levy some
 
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
sort of penalty against someone that
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
they find repeatedly doing that and as
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
as was brought out in the testimony last
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
year in order to prove that bar of
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
intentional Report with intent to harm
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
it's probably not going to happen the
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
first time
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
but once that person has made multiple
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
reports over and over again of unfounded
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
reports the department can take action
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
at this point and the department can can
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
Levy something to to show that person
 
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be doing that and I think
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
that once the example is made you'll
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
find that people are unwilling to make
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
that false report because they've seen
 
01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.390 align:start position:0%
that false report because they've seen
what

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
happens and so I ask you again to pass
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
this as you did last year out of this
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
committee so we can send it back over to
 
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate and hopefully convince them
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
that this is the right way to go and
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions any questions
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
for representative Spain on the bill
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
1111 representative
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
bigford thank you Mr chair um I've
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
almost gotten through what you passed
 
01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
out um but this is about penalties on
 
01:01:14.359 --> 01:01:15.349 align:start position:0%
out um but this is about penalties on
people

01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
that um do not
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
report that that's the first part down
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
the bottom um let me find the exact
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph for you I highlighted it on my
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
sheet but it didn't copy so the
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
Highlight didn't come through
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
um it is almost the end of the uh
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph on the first
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
page after
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
uh after the section about mandatory
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
reporters who fail to report there is a
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
section that says approximately 29
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
states carry penalties in their civil
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
child protection laws for any person who
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
willfully or intentionally makes a
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
report of child abuse or neglect that
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
the reporter knows to be defaults it's
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
right at the very bottom and I can I can
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
show you my highlighted version so you
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
better thank you H oh thank you
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
um I follow up Mr
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
chairman yes thank you and thank you
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
um what is the penalty in New Hampshire
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
there is none for not reporting for not
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
repor in uh I would actually direct you
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
to the chair for that because I don't
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
know I haven't been following the the
 
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
but as as I know the chair is a
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter he might know what
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
the penalty for not reporting is I can't
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
tell you uh I can tell you that for for
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
falsely reporting there is no penalty in
 
01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.630 align:start position:0%
falsely reporting there is no penalty in
New

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've never not reported when
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
it was a case where as a mandatory
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
reporter I had to so it never concerned
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair you want to follow up yes Mr
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up thank you Mr chairman
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
well I thought we were all mandatory
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
reporters now that we had passed
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislation sometime okay technically we
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
are technically okay thank you thank you
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
too I'm sure the traditional mandatory
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
reporters are much more aware of that
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
than everybody who lives on my street
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly I believe that most people
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
if you ask them on the side of the
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
Street right now they wouldn't even know
 
01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
they're a mandatory reporter it's just
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
not a well-known thing and they
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't know what the penalty
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
is for not reporting um however they
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people out there
 
01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:35.559 align:start position:0%
apparently who know that there's no
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
penalty for falsely reporting because
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
it's being weaponized and it's happening
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
more representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
chairman name plate to follow that's
 
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.069 align:start position:0%
chairman name plate to follow that's
right

01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
um whether or not all adults were
 
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporters my profession is a
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
mandated reporter profession and the in
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
the training that I've always gotten you
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
have to have a
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
suspicion of abuse or neglect in order
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
to report just a suspicion as a
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter but that's completely
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
different than just making something up
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no penalty for reporting a
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
suspicion because you would have to have
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
some something that
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
um gives you that suspicion you have to
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
have some type of fact you know the kid
 
01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
has has bruises all over them something
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
um as opposed
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
to um as opposed to you know just making
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
something up the kid has bruises and
 
01:04:45.269 --> 01:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
they don't have them so to answer your
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
question um I've
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
never heard of what the penalty is if we
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't report but we just don't really
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
want to risk our licenses so you know
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
there's always that
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you Mr
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
chair with my Christmas present of
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
lateral Vision I now call on
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
see I turned it off thank you Mr
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh representative
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
for being here so um I do know there is
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
no penalty in New Hampshire for not
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
reporting um I used to practice in New
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
York um for DCF and they do have
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
penalties there was a very famous case
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
out of Westchester where some guidance
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
counselors failed to report sexual abuse
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
and they went to jail for it so um I
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
guess my question
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
is are you interested
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
in copying the rest of the the states
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
that have laws like this where we're we
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
penalizing people for falsely reporting
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
most of those also have a penalty for
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
failing to report because failing to
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
report is more serious to the you know
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of a child than
 
01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
somebody calling you know because
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
they're mad at their neighbor so I guess
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
my question is did you consider or would
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
you consider um having that be part of
 
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
the bill if we're if we're copying other
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
states on one half of the the problem
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I absolutely
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
would I thought there was a penalty in
 
01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:21.799 align:start position:0%
the first place as well as several
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
people who are have been traditional at
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
atory reporters for a long time we all
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
thought there's something that will
 
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
happen to you if you fail to do it um so
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
I think the assumption that there was
 
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
there was some teeth behind it was
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
always there and I would say that's a
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
critical thing too we we should have uh
 
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
when there's a suspicion it should be
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
reported absolutely but when there's
 
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
somebody making something up there
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
too to follow that up if if I'm
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
following the train of thought correctly
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh do we
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
know that a mandatory reporter and I'm
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to use that in the narrow sense
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
not the way it is on the books in New
 
01:07:04.269 --> 01:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but the ones who are likely to
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
do it licensed uh professionals who are
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
mandated to report like myself um and we
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't do it do you know one way or the
 
01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
other whether there's a penalty I do not
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
testimony from your representative said
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
there is not and I'm getting this from
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
other sources up here saying there isn't
 
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
would we like to do that here I would
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
welcome that and maybe that'll help get
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
it through the Senate maybe so um let's
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
consider okay any further questions for
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative Spain representative
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr sorry thank you Mr
 
01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
question um just to be clear this um
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
Bill does not mandate someone give their
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
name it is it is optional to give your
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
name and you can still report
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
anonymously is that correct correct
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you correct that language was uh
 
01:08:04.269 --> 01:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
agreed upon by the director of the dcyf
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
program when I worked with him the old
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
director I have not yet met the new
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
director former director former director
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
that's right we're not going to put age
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
into it um both of them are in good
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
middle age category so yes the former
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
former director and uh we worked for a
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
while to make sure that language gave
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
them the ability to to
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
encourage names for followup so that if
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
there were questions they could follow
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
up because um there's a a problem with
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
following up with a lot of anonymous
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
reports as well that the department said
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
and they would like to encourage but not
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
make it banned
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
so further questions for the prime
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none the chair would like
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
to call the middle-aged but not old um
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
director uh Jeffrey fiser from dcyf to
 
01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.390 align:start position:0%
director uh Jeffrey fiser from dcyf to
come

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.269 align:start position:0%
 
up

01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
Williams good morning uh chairman
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
Pearson and members of the children and
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
family law committee this brings me way
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
back in time I'm looking for represent
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
David Bickford I first appeared before
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
this committee not with a fancy
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
microphone in front of you back in 1999
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
so that's far I go back with the
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record I'm the
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
legislative director for Health and
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
Human Services and with me today is uh
 
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
good morning Jeff fler director DCF and
 
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh want to thank you and the committee
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh responding to refm Spain as you
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
probably are aware we as an agency do
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
act as a resource to committees and we
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
certainly have a hand in drafting
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
legislation I've not I was not involved
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
directly with those conversations but I
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
was involved with at least uh
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
discussions with Joe ripson regarding
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
the Department's position around the
 
01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
bill uh Joe was here as a resource to
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
the committee to provide information to
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
the committee um uh however the
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
department did not take a specific
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
position on this legislation last
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
session uh so if there was some
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
confusion I apologize to the committee
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
and also to represent Fain uh but the
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
department hadn't taken a position on
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
the bill I also understand that director
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
ripson former director also was looking
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
at other state jurisdictions that have
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
similar legislation as that proposed
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
here here uh before the committee uh
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
with that said um there are concerns
 
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
around the issue of the chilling effect
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
for reporting and children's safety and
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
that is at least one of the the
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
considerations that I we believe that
 
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
this committee needs to consider when
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully putting forward such
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislation I know that was an issue
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
when the bill was heard uh in its former
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
iteration in the Senate uh and one of
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
the reasons that I believe that uh the
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee did not uh move the bill
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
forward for consideration and with that
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to our current
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
director to introduce himself because
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
he's a newer face to you uh maybe not
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
since 1999 but he is a wonderful
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
addition to the department so this makes
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
you old John Williams then uh not as old
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
as the Director and composer but yes the
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
Williams yeah just a correction I'm no
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
longer middle-aged but I think I'm old
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
old old old age now so just a correction
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
for the record but uh yeah yeah we have
 
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of confidence in our Central
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
intake that's screen out you know if we
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
feel calls are not legitimate or um not
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
to be uh filed up or to screened out
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're well trained in that um and we're
 
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
also fearful that if penalties are put
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
forth it may discourage people from
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
doing their Duty as mandated reporters
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
into report so that's just basically it
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
um uh again we're pretty comfortable um
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
with uh with how things are working out
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
now and Central intake is um Al
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed uh has been noted um they're
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
they're experts at at deciphering what's
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
not if I could ask a clarification these
 
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
are my words but I would ask if they
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
would be your words too that if we let
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
it be known that there would be
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
penalties for intentionally false
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
reporting it might scare away some
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
sincere reporters thinking uhoh if I'm
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
wrong I will be penalized even though
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
because they're sincere they wouldn't be
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
it would scare them off is not what I'm
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
hearing yeah so that's be our fear and
 
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now working on a
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
resource guide for people to report in
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh suspected abuse neglect abandonment
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
and this will be a guide a computerized
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
guide for people um to guide them into
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
how to report what to report and then uh
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
if they feel it's not risen to the level
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
of reporting um they'll also be
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
available for services we're going to
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
have uh Community guides who will help
 
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
connect people with services to get to
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
the families that that are in question
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
um so there's some systems a lot of
 
01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
systems that are being built now um to
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
really help people report
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
accurately I would assume that there
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
would be a section in this wouldn't
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
there be that makes it a question um
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
that would say if you sincerely believe
 
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
and have a reason to sincerely believe
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
then don't worry if we later investigate
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
and find out that you you were there
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
sincere yeah yeah yeah I mean that's
 
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
that's it John did you want um uh very
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
very uh good question there uh chairman
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
Pearson there is already in the RS
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
andard the chapter
 
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
169c uh immunity from liability when
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
they created the reporting system and
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
the legislation it's been on the books
 
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
for many many years now if not decades
 
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh relative to providing a level of
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
immunity because they were balancing the
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
interest of protecting children versus
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
the concerns and fears of people making
 
01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
reports so uh I believe your concerns
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
are addressed currently in the RSA
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
follow up then if that be the case uh
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
and I would believe you um then wouldn't
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
the malicious false
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
reporters uh be quite different and we
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
would want
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
to try
 
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
to minimize that because I know from
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
working on Family Court matters that
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes people weaponize false
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
reporting wouldn't that yet be still a
 
01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
concern now that you have let uh the
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
people who are sincerely reporting know
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
their immunity question
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
mark um drawing on my former experience
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
back in the early 1990s from Rockingham
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
County when I was an assistant County
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
attorney uh in court matters where
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
individuals uh falsify information
 
01:15:06.629 --> 01:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
regarding material facts before the
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
court there is a class B felony uh at
 
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
least it was at that time I don't
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
believe it's been changed for um uh
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
perjury or providing false information
 
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh so I would imagine that there are
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
some boundaries in current law not
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
reflected necessarily in RSA 169c but in
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
other areas of law that would prevent uh
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
individuals from coming in falsifying
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
testimony uh at a court proceeding then
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
would it not be a an easy matter to use
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
the same language about falsifying of
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
testimony under
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
169c that is a policy consideration for
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
your committee I do think it's important
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh to recognize the concerns regarding
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
the chilling effect for making reports
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
because you're actually asking the
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
individual to process another level of
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
concern relative to putting the Child
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
Safety First that's a consideration that
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
can that you should take into account
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
the other one is is the stakeholders
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
that are out in the community those
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
people who are the mandated reporters
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
typically from either the school setting
 
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
or from a clinical setting like the
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
pediatrician's office that we want to
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that the laws that are in
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
place which are currently in place they
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
they they are working in terms of people
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
making reports the concern is that by
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
changing this law and penalizing for
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
false reports under current statute uh
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
that it could create a Ching effect for
 
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
balancing interests of protecting
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
children versus concerns for for making
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
those reports and I think that's the
 
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that we're trying to articulate
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
without taking a specific position
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
because the policy determination is
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
within the hands of the legislature on
 
01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.350 align:start position:0%
within the hands of the legislature on
this

01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
issue representative de
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
chairman welcome back welcome again
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
director fleet Fleet I'm sorry I knew I
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
fer we've had this discussion for the 16
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
years I've been here
 
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
almost every year and and I think that
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
it's really um something that would
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
could help the committee or but it will
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
definitely help me I'm not going to
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
speak for the committee there's a big
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
difference between falsely reporting
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
and reporting something that you think
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
is neglect and abuse but according to
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
law it truly is not you're reporting
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
something in your heart of hearts you
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
believe that the child is being hurt by
 
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
this particular Behavior but you're not
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
false reporting can you talk a little
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
bit about the difference between false
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
reporting and reporting something that
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
turns out not to be abuse in someone
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
eyes yeah I mean that's a that's a great
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
question and um uh you know that's our
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
challenge you know when a call comes in
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
our intake at first through the phone
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
and questioning and hopefully now people
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
using our resource guide to determine is
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
this the law is this you know legally
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect and that's what our
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
people do every day and again they're
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
well trained in trying to decipher that
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
the idea of people abusing that and and
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
weaponizing it um it's not something
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
that comes to has not come to my
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
attention since I've been here um uh
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
it's not you know T targeted as an issue
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
for us or as something that's
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
problematic and again I think that has
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
to that's attributed to to the way we
 
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
screen calls and um and then when in
 
01:18:44.629 --> 01:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
doubt we get out there we investigate
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
and we see for ourselves what's going on
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so you know I I think that's the
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
important part is that are we equipped
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
to to uh go out there and really tell
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
the truth from from falsehood and the
 
01:18:59.550 --> 01:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
other thing is we are making efforts now
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
to make it more clear for reporters on
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
how to how to report and sort of guide
 
01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
them uh to screen out those that are not
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh legitimately abused or
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
neglect thank you and thank you Mr
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
panck thank you chairman for allowing me
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
to ask this question uh with regards to
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
false reporting there's a very good
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
um you would want to have the person who
 
01:19:30.189 --> 01:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
is making the report to identify
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
themselves because when you're doing
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
something like when you're doing a
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
serious allegation of child abuse what
 
01:19:40.629 --> 01:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
happens to the person that you're
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
reporting and if it isn't true what
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
happens is they lose their second
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
amendment rights this I know has
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
happened it happened to my son and he
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
lost his gun ability to have his guns
 
01:19:59.470 --> 01:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
for a whole year based on a false report
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
so I think it's very important make it a
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
question so how do we protect that from
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
you and uh chairman Pearson uh in
 
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
addressing uh represent panic's question
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I think you have to
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
take in consideration is the scope of
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
the legislation in front of you in other
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
words the four corners of the do of the
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
bill and it's a threshold about the in
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
the report to the central registry in
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
other words abuse neglect what happens
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the real world when there are either
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
divorce actions or actions involving
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
custody of children as we know there are
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
a court actions so that's another layer
 
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
well beyond just the initial report
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
trying to make a determination if a
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
child uh if an investigation needs to be
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
looked into uh many of the reports we do
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
get are uh unfounded and we close out
 
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
the case accordingly and of course those
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
of you who have been doing this for year
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
years uh knows very well about the
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
thoroughness of that system because we
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
certainly worked with this Committee in
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
terms of retention of records and and
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
whatnot so I I think we would be ill
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
advised to try to get into the mindset
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
of a specific court case uh certainly um
 
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
there are safety valves in terms of uh
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
appealing uh Court decisions uh there's
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
also judicial conduct uh Council if
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
there's a question regarding the judges
 
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh in their Ethics in terms of a case
 
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
but I think that's beyond the scope of
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
what we we're going to be able to answer
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
for you today represent
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
Panic one more question followup yes
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
followup question thank you uh my
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
95% of these cases are false reports and
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
what they do is they try to air on the
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
side of safe out of safety concern which
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
I totally understand that so I mean it
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
we can't always tell when somebody's
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
lying so how do we
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's why I don't think it's a good
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
idea to keep fall I don't think it's a
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
good idea to have um it the tips brought
 
01:22:02.239 --> 01:22:03.110 align:start position:0%
good idea to have um it the tips brought
in

01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
anonymously I move to a question oh
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I this is for exact sessions
 
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
good stuff but all right thank you and
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
I'm talking to myself when I say that
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
welcome representative ball thank you
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm just going back in my
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
memory it has been a year so if you
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
could refresh it um perhaps I remember
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
we had testimony and I thought it
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
pertained to this about 10,000
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
allegations per year is that a correct
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
number or somewhere around
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
there um don't know the it's about right
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
um but we we screen out about 50% and
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's what I I'm asking if you could
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
confirm because what I remember and if
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
you could confirm this was that there
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
was about 10,000 and it Whitted down to
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
to about a th000 and then ended up at
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
around I think around 400 um that all
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
had to do with um alcohol and drugs so
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
is am I recollecting that correctly from
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
the last year's it wasn't you who has
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
testified so I'm yeah I'm just wondering
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
if those are accurate numbers now we'll
 
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that I'm here five
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
months but uh we're in the in the well
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
above 10,000 calls we screen out about
 
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
50% or so um
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't know as far as the the
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
connection between drug and alcohol um
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to get back with you on
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
those that at that thank you thank you
 
01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.510 align:start position:0%
those that at that thank you thank you
very

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
much any yes representative
 
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank you Mr
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
Fleer relative to what you stated
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
earlier is that you have staff members
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
that take calls from
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
complainants that are uh offering
 
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that there is abuse taking
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
place and that you have 100% confidence
 
01:23:58.990 --> 01:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
in the determination on whether it's
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
real or made up on the result of these
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
calls on whether uh action should be
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
taken does that mean yes yes okay then a
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh then would that thereby make this
 
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.270 align:start position:0%
uh then would that thereby make this
bill

01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
moot um yeah
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm have you read the bill I've read the
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
summary of the bill oh the summary but
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
not the bill itself right well that's
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
then unfair to you I thought you might
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
have read the bill uh your guidance is
 
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
very important right here is in reading
 
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
the full Bill and in comparison to what
 
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
is happening now under your direction uh
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
that you're responsible for do we need
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
this bill or not yeah again based on the
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
summary and I don't know if John has any
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
other um more in depth but we would say
 
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
there's no need for the bill that's what
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
our current uh assessment would be and
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
and between both of you who's the
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
authority having
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction well I will readily state
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
that I not only read this bill but every
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
other bill that's coming before your
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
committee today so uh with that uh I
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
think again it's a it's a policy
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
determination if you feel this is
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
necessary I think you can tell from our
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
testimony to that we have concerns uh
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
around the bill and I would have to
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
leave it to you to determine whether or
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
not this bill is moved based upon our
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
current practices uh to the uh people at
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
the witness table a follow up to
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon's question about
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh great certainty in screening out Tru
 
01:25:35.709 --> 01:25:35.719 align:start position:0%
and false allegations is one thing for
 
01:25:38.669 --> 01:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
you people to proceed I think the heart
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill goes to punishment of those
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
people who hurt others by making false
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
accusations so to
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
stipulate your well-trained staff I've
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
only met a few of them and I was very
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
impressed um is one thing but the
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
punishment of wrongdoers is another
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
thing and I think the bill goes to that
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
point uh you're
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
agreeing we can do
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
it I director yeah don't bunk your heads
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
well that would be just the other
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
concern would be if there's these
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
penalties that that's that the public is
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
aware of would that keep them um from
 
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
those that are well-meaning of reporting
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
is you know that the danger of them
 
01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:27.639 align:start position:0%
being okay accused of reporting
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
irrespective of how great the new
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
document is going to make it abundantly
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
clear that they have immunity people can
 
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
read it and not get it I understand I
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
work in the legislature yeah thank you
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
any other uh
 
01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.229 align:start position:0%
any other uh
representative

01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I am thankful

that you are here and always here and
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
your valuable resource to us
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
um is there any data that um backs up
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about um so maybe Pro
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
in states where there is a penalty for
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
false reporting is there any data that
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
you can point us to um for those States
 
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
like amount of um
 
01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
amount of reports prior to amount of
 
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.830 align:start position:0%
amount of reports prior to amount of
reports

01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
post and how many um people actually
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
penalized that is a great question and I
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
don't have that answer we we'd have to
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
look at those other
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
states and I was going to say and given
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
the amount of work that your committee
 
01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
researcher I would be uh remissed if I
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
even suggested for her to be looking
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
into Miss Dyer to to to that question uh
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps the National Conference on state
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislators might have a similar uh kind
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
of a document something Shelf ready out
 
01:28:00.669 --> 01:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
there that would address it but that's a
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
great question in terms of looking at
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
the image before and after uh post
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
legislation in terms of either numbers
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
of reports um um around that matter um
 
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that's something we
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
continue to work on rent
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
Nelson having never met anybody more
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
eager to write term
 
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.470 align:start position:0%
eager to write term
papers

01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
papers
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
and doing such a wonderful
 
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
job I bet we'll have that information in
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
a few weeks or at least a little bit of
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
it enough to guide us
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative who else
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
ball thank you Mr chairman so in reading
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
the bill I mean this bill specifically
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
says that it would be a misdemeanor but
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
it would have to be malicious or intent
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
so it would be a repeat offender it
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the first time someone calls
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
that would be the way that I am reading
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
this in understanding that that's who
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
we're really this bill is really
 
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
targeting um in order to I mean you just
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
testified that 50% of the cases that are
 
01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.830 align:start position:0%
testified that 50% of the cases that are
brought

01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
brought
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
forward are not they don't have any
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
validity to them or they're not enough
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
to go forward so knowing that now in
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
reading the bill that this is only
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
intended to go for those people who are
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
weaponizing a system and that they would
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
have repeatedly um done this and you can
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
see a pattern of Behavior would that um
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
change your mind in trying to uh curtail
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
that in order to also protect the
 
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
parents and the children who then have
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
to be investigated to find out that this
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
was really a malicious attempt to um
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
hurt the family with that change your
 
01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
opinion on
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
this and rident Pearson uh drawing again
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
my prior uh background as being uh
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
criminal law attorney in uh Rockingham
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
County ass assistant County attorney
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
prosecutor um this matter if you're
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to put in a a provision in there
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
for a misdemeanor that's a criminal
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
offense uh we as the agency that are
 
01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
doing the screening of cases uh to
 
01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not the information
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
provided either meets a threshold on its
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
face of Prim ofasa child abuse uh that
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
would be our particular role if this
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
case were to be referred to a law
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency it would go to
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
whatever uh presumably either conquered
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
police State Police somebody would do
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
the investigation into this matter the
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
word malicious intent they're getting
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
into when you're doing a criminal act
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm loving looking at ripson Pearson
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
because he's caught up on more seasons
 
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
of uh criminal law uh and should
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
probably already be an honorary jurist
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
doctorate himself okay uh that uh that
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the mindset of malicious intent I
 
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
mean the word malicious if you just look
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
it up in a dictionary would mean evil
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
Bad whatever kind of intent it's not
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
talking about repe conduct of that
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
individual it's so whatever their state
 
01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
of mind was at the at the point of time
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
that they actually did the act and in
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
this case the ACT would be either in
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
communication orally verbally or through
 
01:30:58.750 --> 01:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
written communication providing false
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
information for the purposes of
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
obviously deceiving um you know folks
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
about the actual circumstances around
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
that child our our goal here is as an
 
01:31:11.109 --> 01:31:11.119 align:start position:0%
agency at least under current law is we
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
don't make those assessments of who's
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
telling the truth we have to allow the
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
the process to protect children so if
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
somebody makes a claim of something that
 
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
on its face would be child abuse we
 
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
would be required to looking into that
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
matter investigating it there would be a
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
secondary if this law were to pass a
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
secondary process that would occur under
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system uh relative
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
to whether or not they met the threshold
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the misdemeanor offense which would
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
include the mental state or Mena that's
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
fancy word that they pay to go to law
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
school to get Mena mental state uh of
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
malicious intent but it wouldn't
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
malicious intent in of itself is not
 
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.990 align:start position:0%
malicious intent in of itself is not
repeated

01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
conduct everybody got that that's that's
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
yeah that's good I got more law books
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
for Christmas but I haven't gotten to
 
01:31:57.070 --> 01:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
that one yet representative
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
you again for taking another question
 
01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
for me uh my
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
concern with uh whether the department
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
is accepting this bill or not is the
 
01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.149 align:start position:0%
is accepting this bill or not is the
difference

01:32:15.149 --> 01:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
between false purposeful false
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
reporting that that would have an
 
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
adverse effect on someone's life and
 
01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:29.830 align:start position:0%
adverse effect on someone's life and
lifestyle

01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
lifestyle
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
MH and currently the department having
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
no teeth
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in pursuing the false
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
reporter so if I were to call and I did
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
call once it it wasn't because I was mad
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
at somebody but I called because
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
I I heard parents using four-letter
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
words in front of their 2-year-old
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
continually and I thought oh dear God
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
now the two-year-olds running around
 
01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
saying those words because they're all
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
Miner birds and I thought oh my God that
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
is such bad behavior turns out it wasn't
 
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
is such bad behavior turns out it wasn't
child

01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
abuse but I was doing it for the right
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
reasons but we are hearing all too many
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
times parents being being raped over the
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
Kohls for supposedly abusing their child
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
because a family member or a friend of a
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
family member wants them to pay dearly
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
for the divorce or separation or
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
whatever wouldn't you
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
say that it would give the
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
department more teeth to have a bills
 
01:33:49.119 --> 01:33:50.350 align:start position:0%
department more teeth to have a bills
like

01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
this that that gave a provision for the
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
person to be punished for falsely
 
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
purposely falsely reporting child abuse
 
01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.149 align:start position:0%
purposely falsely reporting child abuse
or

01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
neglect yeah well again
 
01:34:15.629 --> 01:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
um 50% or so uh that calls that we get
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
from well from well-meaning people most
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
of them uh pan out not to meet meet the
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
stat states of abuse neglect like the
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
the parents cursing in front of their
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
child that wouldn't meet our
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
statutes um we are um making every
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
effort though even for cases that don't
 
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
meet abuse and neglect we're offering
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
services to that to that family and and
 
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
also that reporter to know that these
 
01:34:43.229 --> 01:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
services do exist and there's any way we
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
can get them to the family as far as
 
01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
again this this has not been a problem
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
that we that I've seen that my staff
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
when I talk about this spill um uh has
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
said this is a problem and yeah this
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
would help us that that's not come from
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
my team um so I'm not equipped to answer
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
that at this point um it's just
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
something that that we're that's um not
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
come to our attention and again we're
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
doing everything we can in training and
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
getting the right people the right
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
amount of people and now with a new
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
community resource guide to really make
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not uh allowing people
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
who are maliciously reporting um to
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
affect those lives of that family uh
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything in our power to
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
do that I don't know I don't have any
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
evidence that a penalty would help or
 
01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.709 align:start position:0%
evidence that a penalty would help or
not

01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%

still consider myself middle AG I don't
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
know we'll have to get our driver's
 
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.870 align:start position:0%
know we'll have to get our driver's
license

01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
out do you have a Hampshire driver's
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
rean now we're way over time this was
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
very hopeful but we are way over time
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at several cards who say
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
they would like two or three minutes and
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
we are going to go to the three minute
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
rule so with that representative Alicia
 
01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
leus has asked for three minutes and the
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
clock starts once the microphone it is
 
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
on and once you say your first
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
word thank you for having me here my
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro

01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
38 I'm here to tell what happened to me
 
01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
based on a false and malicious call I
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
lost my granddaughter for 14
 
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
months my daughter-in-law came from
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
Seattle where she did not need a
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license cuz she always took
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
public transportation and when she
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
married my son and was pregnant she came
 
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
out to New
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um she decided once she was
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
having to get rides to work that she
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
needed a driver's license and
 
01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
um was she had a babysitter during the
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
days while she was working and was
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
paying somebody privately to give her
 
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
driver's instruction and she by the time
 
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
that was done she would arrive at the
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
babysitter's house after my
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
granddaughter had gone to bed
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
my granddaughter
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
was approximately 6 months old might
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
that so she said I'm not going to wake
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
her up to take her home just to bring
 
01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
her back in the morning so she made
 
01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
arrangements for three days for this
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
babysitter to keep her daughter so she
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
could finish getting her driver's
 
01:37:44.599 --> 01:37:45.950 align:start position:0%
could finish getting her driver's
license

01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
training and in the meantime a relative
 
01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
of the person who was babysitting was
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
jealous of my daughter-in-law and
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
believed that her boyfriend was visiting
 
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
my daughter-in-law when in fact her
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
boyfriend had gone to school with my son
 
01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:08.360 align:start position:0%
and was going over and my son and and
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
her boyfriend were hanging out together
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
but this girl being jealous reported
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
that she was
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
abandoned and
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
neglected so she was uh my granddaughter
 
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
was taken away from the
 
01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.669 align:start position:0%
was taken away from the
babysitter

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
babysitter
 
01:38:32.109 --> 01:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
um 14
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
months 14 months of a time when a
 
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
child is really bonding with their
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
parent 14 months they put they in the
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
process my son and my daughter-in-law
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
broke up over
 
01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
this they put them through all kinds of
 
01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
trainings that they had to go through
 
01:38:57.790 --> 01:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
they told my daughter-in-law she had to
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
get a youth bed that because the baby
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
had grown larger and could no longer be
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
in a crib even though the crib could be
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
you know dropped down and the bars
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
dropped down and used as a bed or um a
 
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
single bed which my daughter had which
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
most people graduate kids from a crib to
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
a to a you know regular twin bed no they
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
made her get a youth bed just all kinds
 
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.159 align:start position:0%
of things she had to do and finally at
 
01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
the court at the court decision they
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
said no harms were done my
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law and Son were not guilty
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
of anything and return the
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
baby except then they charged them fees
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
for all of any expenses occurred during
 
01:39:51.629 --> 01:39:51.639 align:start position:0%
that time when they had taken her
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
all because of a malicious report that
 
01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
hadn't you know that was malicious
 
01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
you've got 30 seconds to wrap it up
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
please and so consequently my
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law ended up leaving the
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
state because she couldn't afford to pay
 
01:40:10.109 --> 01:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
those penalties couldn't afford to pay
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
all of those expenses when she had done
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong and that person who made
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
that report should be deter other people
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
like that should be deterred from making
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
similar reports so this is something
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
that happens thank you would you take
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
any questions sure from the committee
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman yes representative
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
bigford thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um the
 
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
dcyf I'm going to say
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
recommended um were were they not a more
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
safety situation for for the
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
child you said about the expense you
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
said it was a great it sounds like you
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
you meant it to be a great expense to
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
make these changes or upgrades of a bed
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
anyway you mentioned and I'm asking with
 
01:41:09.149 --> 01:41:09.159 align:start position:0%
the upgrades uh because they felt it
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
would be a safer for the
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
child I actually don't know why they
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
recommended a youth bed most people
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't have youth
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
beds the expense
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
that they charged her for the person
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
whose care they put the my granddaughter
 
01:41:30.109 --> 01:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
in got a job and had to
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
um had to pay for child care while she
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
went to work and they put that expense
 
01:41:40.189 --> 01:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
on my daughter-in-law when she got her
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
daughter back made her pay for all of
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
that child care during that time which
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
she never would have incurred on her own
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking it
 
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'm trying to get a timeline here or
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
um an action
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
sequence this report by the jealous
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
person was made to
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
DCF who then presumably screened it
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
between false and true the 50% we heard
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
and thought it had Merit to

the
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
investigator that this W the facts as
 
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
you stated was that the boyfriend wasn't
 
01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
distracting the gal the boyfriend was
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
with the Son and the gal the babysitter
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
was actively doing her
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility was was that testimony
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
was there an opportunity for that
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
testimony to be given by your family we
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
had no idea who made the phone call
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
until after we got the baby back was
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
there an opportunity for you to give
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
testimony according to the statements
 
01:43:01.159 --> 01:43:03.310 align:start position:0%
testimony according to the statements
made

01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:43:06.589 --> 01:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
anonymously um certainly my granddaugh
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
my daughter-in-law you know explained
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
what the situation was when they
 
01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
contacted her but the baby was already
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
gone they took her from the babysitter
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
not from my do daughter-in-law they went
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the babysitter while she was staying
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
there and took her and my daughter did
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
not her daughter-in-law did not know
 
01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
until she went to pick the baby
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
up um and this was dcyf that did this
 
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
yes and when you started learning more
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
information was it then welcome for you
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
to say to DCF wait a minute this is this
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
is false like I said we it it was much
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
it was after the baby had been returned
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know over 14 months later it was
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
later that we found out who the person
 
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
was who made the report we had no idea
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
and it was afterwards we found out who
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
made the report and why and by then my
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law had already taken the
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
baby out of the state but presumably my
 
01:44:15.589 --> 01:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
followup is that when the baby was uh
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
taken away from the babysitter's
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
custody did they give you a reason why
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
NE um abandonment abandonment and they
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
and neglect and
 
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
neglect and were you able to give a
 
01:44:32.109 --> 01:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
response you were someone able to give a
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
response to that at that
 
01:44:34.199 --> 01:44:37.350 align:start position:0%
response to that at that
time

01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
um there was a lady who was the guardian
 
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
adidam for the baby and we were able to
 
01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.470 align:start position:0%
adidam for the baby and we were able to
tell

01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
tell
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
her but I never got to testify no no not
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
until we went to the court case which
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
was 14 months later when they finally
 
01:44:58.830 --> 01:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
returned my granddaughter that's when I
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
had a CH the opportunity I personally
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to um to talk to
 
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
them therefore I would ask does it seem
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
plausible that word on the
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
street that that jealous person has now
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
been prosecuted for FAL reporting at
 
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
Great cost emotionally to your family
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
word on the street would prove a
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
disincentive to others who might do that
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
I would hope so yes thank you any
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Raymond
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
I just
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman um isn't it
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
true that here in New Hampshire DCF does
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
not have the authority to remove
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
children only judges and Court can make
 
01:45:48.639 --> 01:45:49.470 align:start position:0%
children only judges and Court can make
that

01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:52.030 align:start position:0%
that
order

01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
I actually do not know any of those
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
rules so that would be something I would
 
01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
hope you would
 
01:46:04.270 --> 01:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
happened representative panic I know the
 
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
question if I can
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
answer would we be persuaded by your
 
01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.830 align:start position:0%
answer would we be persuaded by your
testimony

01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
that can I that's a question I made it a
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
question so go ahead
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Raymond um my
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
son had custody of his his child and
 
01:46:34.109 --> 01:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
there was a false report that the
 
01:46:34.119 --> 01:46:35.629 align:start position:0%
there was a false report that the
mother

01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
mother
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
made and um before it even went to court
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
they got the police to my son's house
 
01:46:44.239 --> 01:46:45.310 align:start position:0%
they got the police to my son's house
and

01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
removed my grandson from my son's home
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
and we didn't see see that child for 8
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
months not until we went to the Sea a
 
01:46:57.629 --> 01:46:57.639 align:start position:0%
gotting it lit him and had to Hash it
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
all out and so no they don't need to see
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
a judge first they just can go in there
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
and sweep them up I guess thank you for
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
that testimony of your experience anyone
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
ball would you believe that when I was a
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
casa they did take the children from the
 
01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.030 align:start position:0%
casa they did take the children from the
home

01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
um in in that particular case it may
 
01:47:25.629 --> 01:47:25.639 align:start position:0%
have been warranted because um there was
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
drugs in the house but there was nothing
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
going forward they just showed up and
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
took the
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
child well given that that's what
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
happened to my granddaughter I certainly
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
would believe
 
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
that so I'm hearing is it fair to say
 
01:47:43.229 --> 01:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
representative that there's due process
 
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
is not in place here it's there's a
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's a problem it is believed to be
 
01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.109 align:start position:0%
there's a problem it is believed to be
valid

01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
valid
 
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
the baby is immediately removed and it
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
may take going to court there's no 48
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
Hours by which it must be justified or a
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
hearing be held or anything like that
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
it's a long time that's was my
 
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
experience yes okay thank you anyone
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
else representative Bickford uh thank
 
01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you um I'm curious
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
how old was the babysitter and how long
 
01:48:22.750 --> 01:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
happen um the babysitter was middleaged
 
01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:27.790 align:start position:0%
happen um the babysitter was middleaged
I

01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
think which is slightly younger than uh
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
director fleser and me
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
exactly um and it happened a while
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
ago over 20 years
 
01:48:49.229 --> 01:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
ago okay thank you so I don't know that
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
um the the reason I ask is because
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of resources that
 
01:49:03.790 --> 01:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
have been directed to DCF in the last
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say five years so I just
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to get a feel for that thank

referenced a federal statistic roughly
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
83% of child abuse or neglect reports
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
investigated ultimately prove to be
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
unfounded or unsubstantiated and when
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
reported anonymously the number Rises to
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
96% too often reports are made out of
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
spite or to gain an upper hand in the
 
01:50:34.109 --> 01:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
court proceeding weaponizing the system
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
the false reports further harm innocent
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
children and families by a way of
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
obstructing the relationship between the
 
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
children and the targeted parent and
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
interfering with parental rights and
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of that parent during
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
an investigation period the child often
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
times is obstructed from from seeing or
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
having a relationship with the targeted
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
parent this holds true for large numbers
 
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
of false reports of domestic violence to
 
01:50:59.229 --> 01:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
gain an upper hand in the court
 
01:51:01.629 --> 01:51:01.639 align:start position:0%
proceeding again weaponizing the system
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
and causing unnecessary
 
01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
delays the investigations can often take
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
months if if the court is involved child
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
parent contact may be obstructed for
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
months if not years prior to ever being
 
01:51:16.589 --> 01:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
convicted of child abuse or neglect a
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
parent may be put into a central
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
registry which can add adversely affect
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
a parent's ability to find an adequate
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
employment or simply Chaperone a child
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
School field trip when these actions are
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
done maliciously and with with ill
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
intent there needs to be a remedy to
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
address such actions implementing this
 
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
bill would be a step in the right
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
direction I may suggest changing the
 
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
word may to Shell further protects
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
parental rights and limits government
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
interference and changing the word from
 
01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
May to Shell would change the the
 
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
reporting to confidential reporting
 
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
rather than Anonymous reporting this
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
aligns with the 2021 Health and Human
 
01:51:59.310 --> 01:51:59.320 align:start position:0%

those in rural areas may find them self

02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%

another misdemeanor or a Class B penalty

02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
fines the department the Dartmouth
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
report further indicates by analogy
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
because there was a lack of concrete
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
information from our division of motor
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles or the uh Department of Health
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
and Human Services that a suspended Li
 
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
in a state uh about 50% were for failure
 
02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
to pay the
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
fines various fines 40% for failure to
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
appear in court two and a half% for
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
failure to pay child support and 1% for
 
02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:35.910 align:start position:0%
failure to pay child support and 1% for
drug

02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
drug
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
offenses note that nothing in this bill
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
prevents the state from using driver's
 
02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
license information to track down
 
02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
failing those failing to pay child
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
support it only only prevents the
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
suspension or revocation so that the
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
party can maximize their opportunity to
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
earn the monies they need to pay that
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
child support
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
debt now let me review a one case of one
 
02:06:07.549 --> 02:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
of our legislative colleagues The
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
Honorable Jason Janan of
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
seabook he's been without his licens for
 
02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:15.030 align:start position:0%
seabook he's been without his licens for
four

02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:06:17.950 --> 02:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
years yet all his child support payments
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
are currently are are presently current
 
02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:23.719 align:start position:0%
he lost his license without notice that
 
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
should not have happened he ran a truck
 
02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:27.950 align:start position:0%
should not have happened he ran a truck
driving

02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
driving
 
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
business that business was destroyed
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
with the last lack of his license and
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
four other people lost their employment
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
business it's been a long bumpy road but
 
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
he obtained other less Rumer to
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
employment has his has his uh child
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
support current but through another
 
02:06:55.549 --> 02:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
Comedy of Errors associated with false
 
02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
tickets and whatnot uh it it is it is
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
now he is now at the point where he
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
should finally renew get his license
 
02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
renewed at the end of this
 
02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
month meanwhile the state has lost
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
considerable revenue from the loss of
 
02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:15.390 align:start position:0%
considerable revenue from the loss of
his

02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
business so finally let me turn to that
 
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that's at the end of this
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
bill I believe the impact of the State
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
Highway fund Revenue listed as
 
02:07:31.709 --> 02:07:31.719 align:start position:0%
68,000 needs to be compared to the
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
279 million or the 45 million including
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
Turnpike monies that the state
 
02:07:42.669 --> 02:07:42.679 align:start position:0%
receives in uh in its in its
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
taxation this is a d Minimus amount
 
02:07:47.069 --> 02:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
compared to the harm done to the
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
individual's ability to to earn a
 
02:07:51.629 --> 02:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable living in order to pay child
 
02:07:51.639 --> 02:07:52.870 align:start position:0%
reasonable living in order to pay child
support

02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
obligation and as I noted it further
 
02:07:58.350 --> 02:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
discounts the additional State monies
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
lost because of depressing the earning
 
02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
capacities of those so uh
 
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
inhibited with respect to the likelihood
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire would be fiscal
 
02:08:15.069 --> 02:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
fiscally and financially punished for
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
making changes to its laws I remind the
 
02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
Committee of the comments I made earlier
 
02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
that nearly half the states in this
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
Union have already taken action to
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the impact of this honorous
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
penalty without any adverse
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
consequences thank you and I'm ready to
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
take any questions any questions for the
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
representative representative Gibbons
 
02:08:44.910 --> 02:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so I do like
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
this bill because you're absolutely
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
right with the logic where if if you
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
take away someone's ability to go to
 
02:08:51.629 --> 02:08:51.639 align:start position:0%
work then how are they going to pay
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
their child support my question is that
 
02:08:57.549 --> 02:08:57.559 align:start position:0%
it it also makes sense to me for there
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
to be consequences for someone who's
 
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
who's actively trying to avoid paying
 
02:09:06.510 --> 02:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
child support so um so the question that
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
I have is if someone was to and you may
 
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
or may not know this maybe someone else
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
does if someone was to go out of
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
state with malicious intent to try to
 
02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
avoid paying child support is child
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
support um able to be collected across
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
state lines um because the way I see it
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
we should allow them we should allow
 
02:09:35.310 --> 02:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
people to go to work but we do need
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
consequences for people not paying child
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
support so if in other words if it was
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
to follow them that they can't get away
 
02:09:45.709 --> 02:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
from paying child support but still
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
allow them to work then that makes the
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
most sense to me do you so you might not
 
02:09:54.189 --> 02:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
know the answer but maybe you do well as
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
I indicated this bill does not limit the
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
limit the state's ability to track those
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of cases and so uh in in the early
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
in the late 90s when this when this
 
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
legislation was in its Heyday and and
 
02:10:13.229 --> 02:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
and the dead be dad Provisions were
 
02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
being touted uh the examples given were
 
02:10:17.719 --> 02:10:18.830 align:start position:0%
being touted uh the examples given were
uh

02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
Mr X left his family in Ohio and moved
 
02:10:24.669 --> 02:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
to Kentucky and now he's applying for
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
that Kentucky driver's license uh well
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
this bill allows the states to share
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
information yes he's here in Kentucky
 
02:10:35.709 --> 02:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
he's he's applying for a driver's
 
02:10:38.589 --> 02:10:38.599 align:start position:0%
license here you can track him here and
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
and get your child support issues dealt
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
with um and as I also mentioned uh that
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
the that the current current laws allow
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
numerous other methods to collect child
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
support and probably the the most
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
important is to tap into someone's uh
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
income tax returns and and get monies
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
that way and and that's a vehicle for uh
 
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
for getting after other assets as
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
well sounds good representative
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you um chairman uh thank you
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
what I don't see in here is the
 
02:11:25.149 --> 02:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
um where the protections would be from
 
02:11:29.069 --> 02:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
revoking their Professional
 
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
Licensing could that be added to this
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
bill I wanted to start small I wanted to
 
02:11:39.549 --> 02:11:39.559 align:start position:0%
start with the driver's license issues
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
only uh I also agree that uh you know if
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
you're a Prof a professional license uh
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
or business license that it would make
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
sense but uh I I wanted to take a small
 
02:11:56.910 --> 02:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
bite at the Apple first to see the
 
02:11:59.709 --> 02:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
temperature of the uh of the legislature
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
and then if that made sense we could
 
02:12:05.629 --> 02:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.350 --> 02:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%

with the child support order and allows
 
02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:03.559 align:start position:0%
for reinstatement for individuals whose

4D funds which is the 66% of the the
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
budget for the child support program
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
our state is required to have procedures
 
02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the withholding suspension and
 
02:13:25.390 --> 02:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
restriction of the licenses of
 
02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parents who owe past due
 
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
support this comes from the statute it's
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
666

02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
a16 sure 42 USC section
 
02:13:53.629 --> 02:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
welcome um the Mandate also besides
 
02:13:59.109 --> 02:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
driver's license covers professional and
 
02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
occupational licenses recreational and
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
sporting licenses as well uh we would
 
02:14:05.950 --> 02:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
note that second to the income
 
02:14:07.629 --> 02:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
withholding order the suspension of
 
02:14:09.629 --> 02:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license is the most used and
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
the most highly effective enforcement
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
tool available to the child support
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
program um in New Hampshire our policy
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
um allows for
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
the certification of an obligor as
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
non-compliant after 60 days of
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
non-payment um I did a little bit of
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
research in PR preparation for today to
 
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
sort of see where New Hampshire lies
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
with regards to the the day amount
 
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
looking at New England New Hampshire at
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
60 days Connecticut it's 90 days Maine
 
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
it's 60 days Massachusetts it's 8
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
weeks um Rhode Island it's 90 days
 
02:14:52.030 --> 02:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont always wants to be different
 
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's a quarter of the annual obligation
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
which is basically 90
 
02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:58.990 align:start position:0%
which is basically 90
days

02:14:58.990 --> 02:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.790 align:start position:0%
days
um

02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
so if this legislation as proposed go
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
would go through um it would place the
 
02:15:08.270 --> 02:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
bureau out of compliance with its
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
federal state plan requirements and in
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
direct conflict with federal law making
 
02:15:15.310 --> 02:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
the State subject to significant Federal
 
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
sanctions which could include the total
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
loss of federal
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
funding um as well as funding for the um
 
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
incentive funds and the federal tan of
 
02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:29.870 align:start position:0%
incentive funds and the federal tan of
block

02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%

02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
might be and could you tell us what we

funding uh thank you for the question
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
yes um it's could be up to $16.9 million
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
in federal funds uh an additional 1.2

02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
funding and
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
followup uh thank you Mr chairman
 
02:16:41.389 --> 02:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to believe they would take
 
02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
that much away just for uh license do
 
02:16:44.910 --> 02:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
02:16:47.349 --> 02:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
indication what they would take away if
 
02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
this past
 
02:16:53.750 --> 02:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually uh unfortunately i' I've
 
02:16:55.629 --> 02:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
despite being with
 
02:16:58.830 --> 02:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
the Bureau for 23 years we've never
 
02:17:00.990 --> 02:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
lived through one of these so I I I I
 
02:17:04.509 --> 02:17:04.519 align:start position:0%
don't know what it would look like
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
um I do believe we would be given a
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
chance to remedy what the feds would say
 
02:17:13.309 --> 02:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
is our mistake but what that would look
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
like whether that would sort of be an an
 
02:17:18.669 --> 02:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
all or nothing or gradual that I I'm I'm
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't I can't really address one
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
one further one well thank you Mr
 
02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
chairman um we heard about other states
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
doing something but not I'm not clear um
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
um reduction it was called in driver's
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
licenses uh suspension do you know
 
02:17:41.629 --> 02:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
anything about that um I I do know that
 
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
other states do do temporary licenses I
 
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
think that's sort of been the case all
 
02:17:49.230 --> 02:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
along in that personal experience from
 
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
my aunt who lives in New York who has a
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
very heavy foot um she's she when she
 
02:17:55.709 --> 02:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
lost her license due to speeding she was
 
02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
always able to get a a temporary license
 
02:18:01.070 --> 02:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
to get herself to work so that's that's
 
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
something that that I know other states
 
02:18:05.629 --> 02:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
do I don't think that's specific to the
 
02:18:10.349 --> 02:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
child support piece oh um to my
 
02:18:11.309 --> 02:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge it's not something New
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
you representative long was next thank
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um
 
02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
so a lack of a lack of compliance to
 
02:18:30.389 --> 02:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
child support uh has their license
 
02:18:34.349 --> 02:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
revoked so they have a job um and their
 
02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
license and they're not paying support
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
um so is is there is there some way that
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
can prior to pulling a license can can
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
they work out a payment plan and show
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
that that plan is being observed where
 
02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
they could retain their license thank
 
02:18:56.509 --> 02:18:56.519 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative long
 
02:18:59.469 --> 02:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
yes I we they do the child support
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
officers definitely do work with people
 
02:19:05.709 --> 02:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
um what I've found in the past is that
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
the driver the the threat to the
 
02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
driver's license is sometimes the first
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
way we have of getting somebody's
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
attention who's not paying their child
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
support if they have a job we have a
 
02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
wage assignment in place if they have a
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh what we call a W2 job meaning that
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
they work for somebody else they're not
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
self-employed and they're not in the the
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
gig economy so then this is not an issue
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
because the payments are coming in but
 
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
for people who are sort of outside the
 
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
the more normal
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
employment um we send them letters look
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
you owe this money when you're going to
 
02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
start making payments you know what's
 
02:19:43.150 --> 02:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
happening and they get ignored so it's
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
the first letter that goes out that says
 
02:19:47.230 --> 02:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
you're getting close to the point where
 
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
we might take your license a lot of
 
02:19:52.030 --> 02:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
times that's all it takes they they call
 
02:19:53.590 --> 02:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
they set up a payment
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
plan we ask them what's going on and and
 
02:19:58.990 --> 02:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
sort of be like okay let's get this
 
02:20:01.870 --> 02:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
going um I do know that once we've
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
certified them to
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
DMV uh DMV then sends out a notice and
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
gives them time to come to an agreement
 
02:20:12.670 --> 02:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
with us at which point we would then
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
revoke the revocation or there's you
 
02:20:17.790 --> 02:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
know there's language that deal with it
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of times you know people
 
02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
don't they don't actually lose the
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
license in that we we try do try to work
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
with them we also would encourage some
 
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
but if somebody comes in and says they
 
02:20:28.030 --> 02:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
they are unable to pay because they
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
think it's too much money we would
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
encourage them and help them to apply
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
for a modification of their
 
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
order because obviously that's something
 
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
if you know if they've had a change in
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
circumstance or something like that it's
 
02:20:41.230 --> 02:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
like well let's get it to court to make
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
it more affordable and then hopefully
 
02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
then you can make your payments okay
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome represent
 
02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:48.910 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome represent

02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh for
 
02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
full transparency purposes I am a
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill but um I just
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to um ask you one question and
 
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
it's regarding the federal funding um
 
02:21:10.990 --> 02:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill stated that of
 
02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
all the states who have
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
um a law similar to what this bill would
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
be come um that uh there's been no
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
federal um funding that's been withheld
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
C can you either confirm or disprove his
 
02:21:29.309 --> 02:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
statement to that fact uh thank you for
 
02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
the question um I don't have any
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
information about other states other
 
02:21:36.510 --> 02:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
States Federal funding I will tell you
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
from it's a national group
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
that basically listed all the different
 
02:21:53.309 --> 02:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
states and what they do for for license
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
revocation and it's all all 50 states
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
there is not any state that doesn't have
 
02:22:00.750 --> 02:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
it some of them do have the temporary
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
the the the whole temporary piece of it
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
U so then it's up to each state I think
 
02:22:13.630 --> 02:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%

02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
Child Support to suspend driers licenses
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
so our process in that is to send out
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
notification to the most recent mailing
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
address on file with us as well as the
 
02:23:14.269 --> 02:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
address child support provides us if if
 
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's different so two notices
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
potentially can go out this gives the
 
02:23:20.429 --> 02:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
applicant 30 days to respond to child
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
support if they do child support sends a
 
02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
resend notice to us and then we resend
 
02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:26.630 align:start position:0%
resend notice to us and then we resend
that

02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
suspension of those 2400 new child
 
02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
support complaints last year 258 ended
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
up having to pay suspension fees of
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
$100 708 of them cleared child support
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
before the suspension and fee went into
 
02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
effect um 69 are currently pending 1,400
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
of them them are still active they have
 
02:23:51.550 --> 02:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
not cleared child support nor paid um
 
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
their suspension fees so their licenses
 
02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:55.269 align:start position:0%
their suspension fees so their licenses
remain

02:23:55.269 --> 02:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
remain
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
suspended in that count though they may
 
02:24:01.269 --> 02:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
not only be suspended for child support
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
we often see that those that are still
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
remaining suspended are suspended for
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
other reasons so clearing child support
 
02:24:11.469 --> 02:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
may not be priority for them as
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
a DWI or something else is Holy them
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to make note of an earlier
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
testimony where it was stated that DHHS
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
would still be able to use DMV to track
 
02:24:29.950 --> 02:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
these um defendants for their child
 
02:24:33.030 --> 02:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
support they would not DMV DHHS would
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
not have any provisions if this law went
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
into effect to be able to use DMV to
 
02:24:41.469 --> 02:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
gain addresses of these individuals so
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's all that I have for you guys
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
much and it's my custom the custom of a
 
02:24:58.670 --> 02:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
lot of uh chairs to give the prime
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh unlimited time and then
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
expert Witnesses in my choosing that is
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
to say people from agencies especially
 
02:25:11.150 --> 02:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
if they bring a contary view to have um
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time I'm now going into
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
the public comment phase where we will
 
02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
be back to the three minute Rule and
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
while you're up the chair recognizes The
 
02:25:27.309 --> 02:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
Salem I promise it's three minutes or
 
02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
less I'll speak from my personal
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
experience in the cases that I'm
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with but I won't mention
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
anybody's name in my personal experience
 
02:25:44.349 --> 02:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
I've known cases where driver's licenses
 
02:25:46.990 --> 02:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
are still being suspended for years
 
02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
years for failure to pay child support
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
even when the obligor has not ever been
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
permitted her due process to contest
 
02:26:00.990 --> 02:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
unreasonable charges and
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
orders immediately the payer was
 
02:26:07.550 --> 02:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
stripped of their driver's license
 
02:26:10.429 --> 02:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
without regard for driving to
 
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
work I also know of many cases where the
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
payer withholds child support
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
for several months at a time over a
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
period of
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
years and they only pay a week before
 
02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
the pay goes to the expense of a court
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
hearing further missing
 
02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
work in these cases these many payers
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
have never lost their driver's license
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
despite their longstanding history of
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
withholding child support in a malicious
 
02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.630 align:start position:0%
withholding child support in a malicious
game

02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
game
 
02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I support this bill it is
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
totally totally
 
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
non not used for everybody it's just a
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
whim of who gets penalized and who
 
02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't so I think there are other more
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
effective ways to make people pay child
 
02:27:11.469 --> 02:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
support without denying their chance to
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
go to court and show whether or not this
 
02:27:18.269 --> 02:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
is a fair fair obligation
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
much uh chair recognizes uh Mr Robert
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
tangu again for three minutes Make It
 
02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:46.349 --> 02:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
can mik on oh hello thank you um so
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
anyway anyways uh I was I was talking
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
about and I I just looked up the bill um
 
02:27:53.469 --> 02:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
there was a question earlier it's called
 
02:27:56.269 --> 02:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
Uh the pdps system problem driver P
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
poter system it's basically interstate
 
02:28:01.309 --> 02:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
commerce where uh if you agree to get
 
02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
Highway money from the federal
 
02:28:06.030 --> 02:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
government you have to acknowledge other
 
02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
states tickets and uh they have that's
 
02:28:12.269 --> 02:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
attached to licenses I will get into
 
02:28:14.349 --> 02:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
that if I have some time uh what I was
 
02:28:17.309 --> 02:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
talking about was section 401
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh of title 4D 601 not 606 and and so
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
the there's a lot of mechanisms that the
 
02:28:28.910 --> 02:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh state has uh to enforce child support
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
within the court um contempt of court
 
02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
boom and then over and over again if you
 
02:28:34.990 --> 02:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
keep doing it then you're going into
 
02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
jail and people go to jail and that
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
should be done but uh one of the things
 
02:28:41.790 --> 02:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
that they don't follow with uh
 
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
601 uh of the same uh scheme is is fraud
 
02:28:50.830 --> 02:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
so if you report fraud say there's fraud
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
in the case and your child support Rees
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
there's just so much and is you're
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
contesting that for them to pull a
 
02:28:57.840 --> 02:28:59.309 align:start position:0%
contesting that for them to pull a
driver's

02:28:59.309 --> 02:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
driver's
 
02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
license is is it's horrible and that's I
 
02:29:05.550 --> 02:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
got my driver's license back because uh
 
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
in California they said I owed some
 
02:29:09.309 --> 02:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
money and I said well I'm in New
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you have to prove it article
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
14 and I got my license back I talked to
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
Earl Sweeney uh
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
went all the way up there through the
 
02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
political process and they just flipped
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
a switch so we have that and I also want
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
to bring uh the committee's attention to
 
02:29:29.070 --> 02:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
the uniform support Act of
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
1955 which I read and it's on the books
 
02:29:35.230 --> 02:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
and uh one of those is amount of support
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
five RSA
 
02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
54685 and basically they consider assets
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times just picture this Bill
 
02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
Gates finds a homeless woman and
 
02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
willfully gets her pregnant then decides
 
02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
he doesn't want to be with her he can't
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
just kick her out and that's what the
 
02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
law states and in order for I mean I
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
could read the law to you but that's
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
basically what it it it gets that
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
feeling of it it's supposed to be equal
 
02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
for children it's supposed to be uh
 
02:30:07.269 --> 02:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed
 
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
to burden the other
 
02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
party doesn't matter it's all about the
 
02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
children and then further there's a law
 
02:30:19.230 --> 02:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
you can be arrested if you are uh
 
02:30:20.590 --> 02:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
failure to support but they have to
 
02:30:22.030 --> 02:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
prove that you have the ability to
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
support and I can see that you're
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
fidgeting so I'm getting close you are
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
getting close you got about 45 seconds
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay so um child supports interstate
 
02:30:34.750 --> 02:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
commerce it's it's it's funded by
 
02:30:37.469 --> 02:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
Federal grant
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
money for the administration of child
 
02:30:42.269 --> 02:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
support and then with the DMV and all of
 
02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
a said and good in most cases but I do
 
02:30:49.469 --> 02:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh passing because if
 
02:30:51.309 --> 02:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
you take away someone's driver's license
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they absolutely cannot
 
02:30:57.550 --> 02:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
uh support themselves or their children
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
and it's a downward slope thank you the

up good afternoon my name is Jane Bon
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
bullu I'm the executive director of the
 
02:33:17.150 --> 02:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire ass Association of special
 
02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:19.640 align:start position:0%
education administrators and we are here
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of this bill um
 
02:33:26.269 --> 02:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
basically um a couple years ago special
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
education statute was amended um to
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
raise the eligibility age for students
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
with disabilities to age 22 or sometimes
 
02:33:42.309 --> 02:33:42.319 align:start position:0%
called 21 inclusive um at that time when
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature um passed that bill they
 
02:33:47.429 --> 02:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
didn't take into to consideration the
 
02:33:49.630 --> 02:33:49.640 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice
 
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
statutes um which um really you know
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would return the jurisdiction
 
02:34:00.670 --> 02:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
of um
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
students until they age out of special
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
education so it would actually align the
 
02:34:08.349 --> 02:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
special education statutes with the
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice statutes so you know
 
02:34:13.950 --> 02:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
we're in support of this bill because it
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
really um supports those students who um
 
02:34:20.550 --> 02:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
are in those situations where um they
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
may be in a residential treatment center
 
02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
at age 18 and yet they can't continue on
 
02:34:29.790 --> 02:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
um with special education through age 22
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
and you have to apply for waivers and
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's you know lots of blocks so on
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
behalf of the students that that we
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
serve um we are in support of aligning
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.429 --> 02:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
recognizes yeah I know rep none only one
 
02:34:56.590 --> 02:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
changed the name over Christmas
 
02:34:59.710 --> 02:34:59.720 align:start position:0%

sorry thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
you for helping to bring this forward
 
02:35:11.070 --> 02:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
and um bring this information to us
 
02:35:14.110 --> 02:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
basically this is just a housekeeping
 
02:35:16.750 --> 02:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
Bill essentially right to line the
 
02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:18.710 align:start position:0%
Bill essentially right to line the
current

02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
22 and that's it it's yes that's from
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's on behalf of the kids just
 
02:35:26.429 --> 02:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
they don't get stuck in the system thank
 
02:35:31.309 --> 02:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
you I know in working a fair bit with
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
the DD Community things could really get
 
02:35:38.670 --> 02:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
streamlined and maybe this bill will
 
02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
help that is that the assertion of those
 
02:35:42.990 --> 02:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
who favor this
 
02:35:46.110 --> 02:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
bill exactly say yes yes thank you
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%

02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you do
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
we know um how many uh kids we currently
 
02:35:57.750 --> 02:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
have in placement who would be impacted
 
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
by this spell I'm just I'm trying to
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
think of numbers because I know we have
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
a number that are being served out of
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
state because we don't have placement in
 
02:36:08.230 --> 02:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
state like 50 or 60 um and I'm just
 
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
curious how many of them fall into this
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
this age hole of 18 to 22 thank you for
 
02:36:15.469 --> 02:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
the question I don't have that
 
02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
information today but I could get it for
 
02:36:19.469 --> 02:36:19.479 align:start position:0%
you okay thank
 
02:36:26.910 --> 02:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%

02:36:31.550 --> 02:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
no introduction but he's getting one
 
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
anyway The Honorable John Williams
 
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
Esquire late of Rockingham County
 
02:36:42.990 --> 02:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
decades in service to the state of New
 
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:45.200 align:start position:0%

02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
Stringer for the day uh for total
 
02:36:52.429 --> 02:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
transparency we're here to provide
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
information uh on this bill and by way
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
of background I actually before I went
 
02:36:58.710 --> 02:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
to law school had my background in
 
02:37:01.230 --> 02:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
special education um and really enjoyed
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
working uh with that population uh of
 
02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
kids but as to the bill that's in front
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
of you in with less than three minutes
 
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
of time we are supportive of the concept
 
02:37:12.429 --> 02:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
um this bill attempts to do what other
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that you've seen either with
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
this committee or the house education
 
02:37:18.510 --> 02:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
committee to align the age for children
 
02:37:21.070 --> 02:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
to receive Services up to age 22 so
 
02:37:22.670 --> 02:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
that's what's attempting to be done here
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
we support the concept uh although we
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
know it's an issue for division three
 
02:37:28.990 --> 02:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
but knowing that your chair is very good
 
02:37:31.070 --> 02:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
friends um not only friendship um
 
02:37:33.269 --> 02:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
collegial uh but also from the class of
 
02:37:35.550 --> 02:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
2016 of legislators is representative
 
02:37:38.429 --> 02:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
Jess Edwards so there is the need to at
 
02:37:40.990 --> 02:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
least mention uh the need for resources
 
02:37:42.990 --> 02:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do what is being
 
02:37:44.469 --> 02:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
requested in this bill which we would
 
02:37:47.790 --> 02:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
say the underlying goals here are latory
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
there are going to be the need for the
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
resources we can't do it without the
 
02:37:54.030 --> 02:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
resources in terms of the communitybased
 
02:37:55.550 --> 02:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
care for these children because they're
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
going to need those Services up to that
 
02:38:00.030 --> 02:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
particular age uh there are modum
 
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
Staffing Resources that are identified
 
02:38:03.630 --> 02:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal analysis attached to the
 
02:38:05.469 --> 02:38:05.479 align:start position:0%
bill and those are things we know that
 
02:38:07.389 --> 02:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
will be addressed if this bill passes
 
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
out of the committee to be for
 
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
discussions at division three however
 
02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
I've been at division three and the
 
02:38:14.190 --> 02:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
first question they asked did you bring
 
02:38:15.950 --> 02:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
up these Financial issues before the
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
committee and I know at risk of being
 
02:38:20.070 --> 02:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
told we're a policy committee not fiscal
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
you can't do the policy without the
 
02:38:24.190 --> 02:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal part of it and you're not doing a
 
02:38:25.950 --> 02:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
service to the citizens that we both
 
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
Serve by passing legislation that
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the resources to accomplish
 
02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
those goals so with that that ends my uh
 
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
commentary and with that I am concluding
 
02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:36.230 align:start position:0%
commentary and with that I am concluding
my

02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and might it be true and this
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
isn't would you believe this is a real
 
02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
question might it be true that while
 
02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:38:51.790 --> 02:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
itself might demand lots more money from
 
02:38:55.309 --> 02:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
division free in the real world it does
 
02:38:58.830 --> 02:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
not demand as much as one thinks because
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
when waivers are sought and gained that
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
now that was a
 
02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
question it was a money question and at
 
02:39:15.070 --> 02:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the day I always check my
 
02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
wallet my account to see how much money
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
I need to have and this is going to need
 
02:39:21.150 --> 02:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
money whether it's called through waiver
 
02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
Services we do need a direct
 
02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation for this I'm obviously not
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
understanding the question okay
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
obviously I I did it in the liberal arts
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
form I'll try to put it in lawyer
 
02:39:35.110 --> 02:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
language no I can't um we're spending
 
02:39:38.190 --> 02:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
money for people over 18
 
02:39:41.070 --> 02:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
now it's called the you're getting some
 
02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
waivers and that funds things and the
 
02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
orange badge people are nodding and
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
therefore we're we're partway there
 
02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
we're not starting from zero saying
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
every needy person from 18 to what 22 is
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
now going to get a lot of money we're
 
02:39:58.349 --> 02:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
saying some so I I think I Now
 
02:39:59.429 --> 02:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
understand better when you're referring
 
02:40:00.670 --> 02:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
to W you're talking about waiver
 
02:40:02.910 --> 02:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
Services yeah uh through through the
 
02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
department and it is true that when
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the different
 
02:40:07.950 --> 02:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
categories of individual children who
 
02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
are 18 or under 18 to 22 and then the
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
adult community there is still a gap
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
within that area of the 18 to 22 which
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to align again I
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
came here saying that we are supportive
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the concept of Bill but we do need
 
02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
the resources and can't do this without
 
02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
those resources and I need to make that
 
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear chairman Pearson thank
 
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
you and I'm rehearsing my speech towards
 
02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
the chairman of division three as we
 
02:40:34.990 --> 02:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
speak thank you and if you could mention
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
the need for putting appropriation
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that would be
 
02:40:39.550 --> 02:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciated and we could
 
02:40:40.910 --> 02:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
certainly be part of that conversation
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
to assist you with that so since this is
 
02:40:46.190 --> 02:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to division three should it pass
 
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh they can put funding language
 
02:40:52.750 --> 02:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
in would you say particularly in if
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're encouraged by the policy
 
02:40:55.349 --> 02:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
committee that recognizes that the
 
02:40:57.070 --> 02:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
department needed the resources to be
 
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
able to implement the
 
02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
legislation the chair recognizes
 
02:41:02.479 --> 02:41:04.590 align:start position:0%
legislation the chair recognizes
representative

02:41:04.590 --> 02:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:41:08.830 --> 02:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
Grossman great job Mr chairman thank you
 
02:41:11.550 --> 02:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
um would you
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
so the students that are currently the
 
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
18 to 22 now that that law has passed
 
02:41:21.870 --> 02:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
that aren't in the Juvenile Justice
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
System wouldn't it be illegal if we
 
02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
didn't find the money the funding so it
 
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
becomes these CH these kids under free
 
02:41:34.830 --> 02:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
and appropriate public education you
 
02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
know this is a housekeeping these kids
 
02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
still have IEPs they still have needs
 
02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
they still that hasn't changed it's just
 
02:41:47.389 --> 02:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
that these kids happen to be in the
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice System
 
02:41:53.550 --> 02:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
versus the other kids that we found that
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
funding for up until 22 in our school
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
systems my son is one of those kids
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
who's 18
 
02:42:05.870 --> 02:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
um it's it we'll get lawsuits as well we
 
02:42:08.349 --> 02:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
you know if we don't fund this on the
 
02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
front end because it will be required by
 
02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:13.710 align:start position:0%
front end because it will be required by
federal

02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:42:18.110 --> 02:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
and given that I have a whole host of
 
02:42:20.910 --> 02:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys including those who might want
 
02:42:22.630 --> 02:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
to provide commentary behind me that
 
02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
would be fing the litigation I will just
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
refrain from answering it but we do
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
think that there's a merit behind this
 
02:42:30.190 --> 02:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
bill and and the need to accomplish the
 
02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
goals of the
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
legislation representative ball thank
 
02:42:36.630 --> 02:42:36.640 align:start position:0%

totally separate from this one and we
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
were actually told that the budget
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee would not do anything on
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
speculation and we needed to pass the
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill and they will find the
 
02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
money would you believe that
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%

to turn on the microphone without a
 
03:40:34.189 --> 03:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
prompt I was just in a committee where
 
03:40:35.990 --> 03:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
no one had their microphones on so if

03:40:40.510 --> 03:40:40.520 align:start position:0%

03:41:13.950 --> 03:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
benefits these are children with

disabilities or children who have lost a

parent and across the nation states have
 
03:41:24.870 --> 03:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
retained these benefits when a child is
 
03:41:29.590 --> 03:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
in foster care but that is changing many
 
03:41:31.950 --> 03:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
states are moving to pass legislation to
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
preserve the benefits for the foster

them to make needed changes in this

policies the national public radio and
 
03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
The Marshall Project found that 49
 
03:42:06.269 --> 03:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
States including New Hampshire routinely
 
03:42:09.389 --> 03:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
retain a child's benefits and the funds
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
are used to reimburse the state for the
 
03:42:15.590 --> 03:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
cost of foster care states have an
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
obligation to pay the cost of foster
 
03:42:21.630 --> 03:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
care under state and federal law so the
 
03:42:24.030 --> 03:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
existing policy of the state retaining
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
the benefits means some of our neediest
 
03:42:30.790 --> 03:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
children pay for their own foster
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
care the proposed legislation has the
 
03:42:36.269 --> 03:42:36.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:42:38.990 --> 03:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
establishing an appropriate account to
 
03:42:42.630 --> 03:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
conserve to conserve the benefits until
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
the CH child leaves foster care this
 
03:42:48.550 --> 03:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
could be lifechanging for a young person
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
leaving foster care they could now have
 
03:42:54.790 --> 03:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
some resources to pay for housing
 
03:42:57.950 --> 03:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
possibly continue their education or buy
 
03:43:01.750 --> 03:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
a car to allow them to get to a job we
 
03:43:04.269 --> 03:43:04.279 align:start position:0%
hear so often that many youth leaving
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
foster care have no family to go back to
 
03:43:11.670 --> 03:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
no resources and and often become
 
03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
homeless I want to thank the uh division
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
of children youth and families for the
 
03:43:18.670 --> 03:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
assistance they gave me in drafting the
 
03:43:21.630 --> 03:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
bill making this change in state policy
 
03:43:23.950 --> 03:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
will be time consuming for the
 
03:43:27.149 --> 03:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
department and I have added the ability
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
for an
 
03:43:31.189 --> 03:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the bill at the time of
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
unclear how much the department would
 
03:43:40.950 --> 03:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
need to accomplish this for Foster
 
03:43:43.389 --> 03:43:43.399 align:start position:0%
children if your committee finds the
 
03:43:43.399 --> 03:43:44.550 align:start position:0%
children if your committee finds the
policy

03:43:44.550 --> 03:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:43:47.229 --> 03:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
worthwh the finance committee can work
 
03:43:50.269 --> 03:43:50.279 align:start position:0%
with the Department on the needed
 
03:43:52.830 --> 03:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation at the time of the bill
 
03:43:55.229 --> 03:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
drafting this policy change was
 
03:43:58.550 --> 03:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
estimated to affect about 90 children a
 
03:44:00.389 --> 03:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
year in New
 
03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and according to the
 
03:44:05.229 --> 03:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
information from the Department of
 
03:44:07.469 --> 03:44:07.479 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services the state
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
retained 569 ,000 in
 
03:44:14.710 --> 03:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
2022 and
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
$521,000 in 23 from foster children
 
03:44:22.389 --> 03:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
children's disability and survivor
 
03:44:25.750 --> 03:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
benefits in a state that has a budget
 
03:44:29.389 --> 03:44:29.399 align:start position:0%
surplus has reduced business taxes and
 
03:44:31.469 --> 03:44:31.479 align:start position:0%
moved to eliminate the interest in
 
03:44:34.389 --> 03:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
dividends tax it seems shameful for us
 
03:44:37.469 --> 03:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
to retain the Social Security disability
 
03:44:41.110 --> 03:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
and survivor benefits from of our foster
 
03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
children to pay for their own foster
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
care these are some of the neediest
 
03:44:48.790 --> 03:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
children in our state and by passing
 
03:44:51.269 --> 03:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
this legislation we can make a huge
 
03:44:52.670 --> 03:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
difference in their
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
future I have um I was going to leave
 
03:45:00.189 --> 03:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
you with a couple of um articles about
 
03:45:02.790 --> 03:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
this and the impact it's having
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
Nationwide on the foster care system so
 
03:45:09.389 --> 03:45:09.399 align:start position:0%
um I'll leave them for you if uh someone
 
03:45:12.149 --> 03:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
want me too I can run upstairs and get
 
03:45:14.349 --> 03:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
copies for the committee but I do have
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
at one one copy of each of the three
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
articles I think we like that sort of
 
03:45:22.189 --> 03:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
thing and if you want to do it after
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
immediately after this hearing has
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
concluded that way you won't miss
 
03:45:28.750 --> 03:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
anything that we're discussing and uh
 
03:45:30.149 --> 03:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
come on back and then give it to
 
03:45:31.870 --> 03:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford who'll pass them
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
around great thank you is there a fiscal
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
note anywhere um I believe that I I had
 
03:45:40.590 --> 03:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
not seen the f fiscal note that the
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
department had uh but I believe there is
 
03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note floating around someplace
 
03:45:47.429 --> 03:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
at the time that the bill was published
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
there was no fiscal note and when I when
 
03:45:55.630 --> 03:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
I started to draft the bill I I did uh
 
03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
work with the Department on the wording
 
03:45:59.710 --> 03:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill and they they were very
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
helpful in helping me word it the way
 
03:46:04.750 --> 03:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
they felt comfortable with it and at the
 
03:46:07.229 --> 03:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
time it was really hard to determine
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
what kind of a fiscal impact it would
 
03:46:11.510 --> 03:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
have so I think that's something Finance
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
can work with them on and but I did put
 
03:46:15.990 --> 03:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill it does have an
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation of $1 to allow us to allow
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
us to work on the bill and to have an
 
03:46:25.110 --> 03:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation the bad news is although
 
03:46:26.910 --> 03:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of money there's a lot
 
03:46:29.070 --> 03:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
more people wanting a lot more than we
 
03:46:32.149 --> 03:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
have and at the very least our
 
03:46:35.229 --> 03:46:35.239 align:start position:0%
discussing this can be aspirational for
 
03:46:37.389 --> 03:46:37.399 align:start position:0%
the next budget I hope we can do more
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
than that but at the very least we can
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh signal that it is the belief of this
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
well what the belief of this committee
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
is towards funding in the future uh will
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
you take questions sure sure anybody
 
03:46:52.750 --> 03:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
with a question representative
 
03:46:55.269 --> 03:46:55.279 align:start position:0%

very interesting Bill I'm curious do we
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
know if there are any states who have
 
03:47:05.910 --> 03:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
enacted uh legislation like this yes do
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
do you know which ones there are there
 
03:47:10.189 --> 03:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
are quite a few that are
 
03:47:12.189 --> 03:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
right now working on it and many that
 
03:47:14.790 --> 03:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
have passed it also and I have these
 
03:47:17.189 --> 03:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
articles which I will bring back and you
 
03:47:19.469 --> 03:47:19.479 align:start position:0%
can see some of the examples of state
 
03:47:24.590 --> 03:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
and our bill this bill was drafted using
 
03:47:29.950 --> 03:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
the model of the Arizona okay thank you
 
03:47:33.110 --> 03:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislation representative
 
03:47:36.830 --> 03:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
bigford thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
represent walner yes the
 
03:47:43.309 --> 03:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
Social Security uh payments which I
 
03:47:46.349 --> 03:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
assume that this includes payments uh
 
03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
made when there's a parent that dies
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay and what is the intent of that
 
03:47:54.149 --> 03:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
Social Security
 
03:47:56.189 --> 03:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
funding why why did this federal
 
03:47:57.870 --> 03:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
government decide that we should give
 
03:48:00.189 --> 03:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
Social Security money
 
03:48:02.710 --> 03:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
to on behalf of children not necessarily

03:49:16.269 --> 03:49:16.279 align:start position:0%
honorable chair and members of the
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michelle wangren
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney at New Hampshire legal
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
assistance and the director of the youth
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
law project the youth law project at New
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance is a specific
 
03:49:29.070 --> 03:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
project that works with system involves
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
involved kids to make sure that their
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
civil needs are met to keep them out of
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
the Juvenile Justice and Child
 
03:49:39.990 --> 03:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
Protection Systems um so in that vein my
 
03:49:41.870 --> 03:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
testimony today is going to be very
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
practical I am not a social security
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
expert but I do have some experience
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
based on my representation of Youth who
 
03:49:50.790 --> 03:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
have been in the system and how the
 
03:49:54.269 --> 03:49:54.279 align:start position:0%
current practice has a very real impact
 
03:49:56.670 --> 03:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
on already impoverished Youth and
 
03:50:00.189 --> 03:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
families so as a sort of a broad
 
03:50:02.950 --> 03:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
overview uh Social Security the Social
 
03:50:05.149 --> 03:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
Security commissioner has very broad
 
03:50:07.469 --> 03:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
discretion in determining who is the
 
03:50:09.550 --> 03:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
What's called the representative paye
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
for a child who receives Social Security
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
benefits so representative pay is
 
03:50:17.590 --> 03:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
typically an adult or an it could be an
 
03:50:20.790 --> 03:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
agency um that manages a child's Social
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
Security benefits for them because they
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
are children and we don't just hand over
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
that money to them so the money that is
 
03:50:32.110 --> 03:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
received by uh Social Security to a
 
03:50:34.630 --> 03:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
child is supposed to be used for their
 
03:50:37.790 --> 03:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
benefit and there are various different
 
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
types of Social Security but
 
03:50:41.950 --> 03:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
if we make it very basic and talk about
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
SSI um which is the supplemental social
 
03:50:49.030 --> 03:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh security income that income is
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
designed for children who are um either
 
03:50:55.349 --> 03:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
disabled or or who have lost a parent um
 
03:50:59.229 --> 03:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
and who have um very minimal Family
 
03:51:02.070 --> 03:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
Resources um so so it would not be
 
03:51:05.309 --> 03:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
available to children and families who
 
03:51:07.990 --> 03:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
are well resourced and have the ability
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
to maintain Ain um
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
their housing and food without some
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
supplemental income um it also is um
 
03:51:20.590 --> 03:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
designed to ensure that their disability
 
03:51:23.830 --> 03:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
based needs um can be met because those
 
03:51:26.469 --> 03:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
often come with added costs so if we
 
03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
look at it with that lens um and the
 
03:51:32.550 --> 03:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
fact that the representative pay
 
03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
obligation is to make sure that this
 
03:51:36.149 --> 03:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
money is used in the best interest of
 
03:51:39.309 --> 03:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
the of the child um there are certain
 
03:51:41.790 --> 03:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
factors that uh Social Security is
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to look at in determining the
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
best representative pay one of these
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
factors is the relationship of the
 
03:51:50.710 --> 03:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
recipient to the child typically that is
 
03:51:52.830 --> 03:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
a natural parent because a parent is
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
presumed to act in the child's best
 
03:51:59.950 --> 03:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
interest to manage um money that is uh
 
03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
provided to them on their behalf parents
 
03:52:05.790 --> 03:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
um typically do that and and and there's
 
03:52:07.630 --> 03:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
typically a rebuttable presumption that
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
if they're not for what reason managing
 
03:52:11.349 --> 03:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
their funding then Social Security can
 
03:52:12.910 --> 03:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
look to other folks that could be a
 
03:52:14.830 --> 03:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
close relative it could be a close
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
family friend but somebody who knows the
 
03:52:18.670 --> 03:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
child well and knows what their needs
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
are is typically looked to there's a
 
03:52:25.070 --> 03:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
list of of folks that are sort of an
 
03:52:27.630 --> 03:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
order of preference and um in a manual
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
that it's a Palms manual that explains
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
how Social Security benefits should be
 
03:52:34.830 --> 03:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
managed um and typically a state agency
 
03:52:38.750 --> 03:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
is last on the list um it is not what
 
03:52:40.110 --> 03:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
typic typically Social Security should
 
03:52:42.790 --> 03:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
look to as the first choice to manage a
 
03:52:45.550 --> 03:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
child's Social Security benefits another
 
03:52:46.990 --> 03:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
factor that Social Security is supposed
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
to look to um in determining a rep
 
03:52:51.790 --> 03:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
representative paye is a knowledge of
 
03:52:53.590 --> 03:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
the child's current and foreseeable
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
needs again a parent typically knows
 
03:52:57.790 --> 03:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
what the child's current needs are and
 
03:52:59.149 --> 03:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
what the child's hopes and dreams are
 
03:53:00.910 --> 03:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
and what they what they may need down
 
03:53:03.630 --> 03:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
the road um and then the third factor is
 
03:53:05.269 --> 03:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
custody and proximity of the
 
03:53:08.110 --> 03:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
representative pay in to the beneficiary
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
um typically you know when you're
 
03:53:13.389 --> 03:53:13.399 align:start position:0%
talking about a child in um the custody
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the department it could go either way
 
03:53:17.630 --> 03:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
I mean the department is typically based
 
03:53:20.110 --> 03:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
in conquered a family could be in close
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
proximity they should be in close
 
03:53:23.710 --> 03:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
proximity they may not be in close
 
03:53:25.469 --> 03:53:25.479 align:start position:0%
proximity but the presumption is is
 
03:53:27.030 --> 03:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
they're visiting and maintaining that
 
03:53:30.670 --> 03:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
close connection to the family so that's
 
03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
how Social Security is supposed to work
 
03:53:36.750 --> 03:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
um most States including New Hampshire
 
03:53:39.469 --> 03:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
have a very long-standing practice ice
 
03:53:39.479 --> 03:53:40.670 align:start position:0%
have a very long-standing practice ice
of

03:53:40.670 --> 03:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
bypassing that order of preference when
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
a child enters the custody of the state
 
03:53:49.149 --> 03:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
um so when a child is removed from home
 
03:53:50.990 --> 03:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
and enters either foster care or
 
03:53:53.710 --> 03:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
institutional placement that order of
 
03:53:56.990 --> 03:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
preference sort of disappears and what
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
happens as a matter of practice and it
 
03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
used to be dcyf policy I'm not sure if
 
03:54:05.590 --> 03:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
it still is but but DCF will typically
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
apply to become the child's
 
03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:09.710 align:start position:0%
apply to become the child's
representative

03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:11.950 --> 03:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
and typically the Social Security
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
Administration will rubber stamp that
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
without any investigation as to whether
 
03:54:18.870 --> 03:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
or not the child has a natural parent or
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
other person who can manage the child's
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
fund funds um in their best interest and
 
03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
in my legal practice uh representing
 
03:54:31.070 --> 03:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
kids who have entered the custody of the
 
03:54:33.510 --> 03:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
state this absolutely happens with
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely no
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
investigation how does that impact the
 
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
children so so when so typically again
 
03:54:43.950 --> 03:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
we have to remember these are
 
03:54:46.950 --> 03:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
impoverished families who are um who
 
03:54:48.910 --> 03:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
have maybe been receiving these Social
 
03:54:50.429 --> 03:54:50.439 align:start position:0%
Security benefits for their disabled
 
03:54:54.030 --> 03:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
child um or for or for children who have
 
03:54:56.429 --> 03:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
um lost a parent for a long time before
 
03:54:58.830 --> 03:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
the child enters State custody this
 
03:55:01.870 --> 03:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
money is Subs subsistence money it's not
 
03:55:05.469 --> 03:55:05.479 align:start position:0%
money that's designed to add to the
 
03:55:07.630 --> 03:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
child's life and go on vacations and do
 
03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
these things the family has determined
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
that the child needs the money to meet
 
03:55:13.510 --> 03:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
the child's basic needs that includes
 
03:55:16.830 --> 03:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
housing that includes food that includes
 
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
clothing that includes
 
03:55:22.389 --> 03:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
um disability Based Services that the
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
child needs um and Recreation to the
 
03:55:27.229 --> 03:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
extent that Recreation is available when
 
03:55:28.750 --> 03:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
we talk about Recreation that doesn't
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
mean um that doesn't mean vacations but
 
03:55:34.830 --> 03:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
it might mean something normal like you
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
know being able to play on a basketball
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
team and pay the fee for the uniform
 
03:55:41.710 --> 03:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
forms so we're talking about very um
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
basic basic needs so when a child goes
 
03:55:47.070 --> 03:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
into custody uh whether it's a
 
03:55:50.189 --> 03:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
residential placement or a foster home
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
the the plan always is in the first
 
03:55:55.070 --> 03:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
instance to reunify the child with the
 
03:55:58.149 --> 03:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
family now what happens when a a family
 
03:56:00.830 --> 03:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
who's receiving say $700 which is the
 
03:56:03.670 --> 03:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
typical it's 700 and some change I don't
 
03:56:04.830 --> 03:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
know what it is these days but it's
 
03:56:07.550 --> 03:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
around there um they suddenly they
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
suddenly lose that money that they need
 
03:56:11.070 --> 03:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
that they've relied on to maintain the
 
03:56:14.349 --> 03:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
child's home food clothing um and those
 
03:56:14.359 --> 03:56:15.269 align:start position:0%
child's home food clothing um and those
basic

03:56:15.269 --> 03:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
basic
 
03:56:18.510 --> 03:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
needs in my experience those families
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
are become immediately at risk of losing
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
their housing um and some become very
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
very close if not actually losing it
 
03:56:29.229 --> 03:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
while the child is in the custody of the
 
03:56:31.950 --> 03:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
department um in a case several years
 
03:56:34.030 --> 03:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
ago this was exactly the scenario where
 
03:56:35.349 --> 03:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
the family actually did lose their
 
03:56:38.229 --> 03:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
housing I went to Social Security um the
 
03:56:40.110 --> 03:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
The Who who was managing the child's
 
03:56:42.510 --> 03:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
benefits at the time and I said look
 
03:56:43.950 --> 03:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
this this family is about to lose
 
03:56:46.950 --> 03:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
housing they need this money the
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
department is using it automatically
 
03:56:50.429 --> 03:56:50.439 align:start position:0%
they became the rep pay and they're
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
they're paying to reimburse theirselves
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
themselves for the child's residential
 
03:56:57.070 --> 03:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
placement this family wants this child
 
03:56:58.830 --> 03:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
back this child wants to go back to the
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
family but that this child will never
 
03:57:03.309 --> 03:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
make it back to the family if the family
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
loses their home and in the end with a
 
03:57:10.269 --> 03:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
lot of work a lot lot of work that
 
03:57:12.349 --> 03:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
typically these families don't have
 
03:57:14.469 --> 03:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
access to lawyers um but I was
 
03:57:16.149 --> 03:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
representing this child on education
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
issues and happen to know that this was
 
03:57:21.630 --> 03:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
happening um and and was able to get
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
involved because nhla has expertise in
 
03:57:26.790 --> 03:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
it um but with a lot of work we were
 
03:57:28.830 --> 03:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
able to convince the department to
 
03:57:33.149 --> 03:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
provide the parent um gas cards and rent
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
rental assistance to be able to maintain
 
03:57:36.750 --> 03:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
that family's home and be able to
 
03:57:39.149 --> 03:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
continue contact with the child that
 
03:57:41.229 --> 03:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
would have never happened without that
 
03:57:45.149 --> 03:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
tremendous effort um the second thing is
 
03:57:46.710 --> 03:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
that when a child goes into placement
 
03:57:48.429 --> 03:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
even if they're not necessarily at risk
 
03:57:52.309 --> 03:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
of losing their home um kids don't have
 
03:57:54.550 --> 03:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
money these are families that now have
 
03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
to use all of their resources for their
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
housing um because they're shifting from
 
03:58:02.149 --> 03:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
using a portion of the payment to
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
support the the maybe the child's
 
03:58:05.309 --> 03:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
bedroom they have to have a two-bedroom
 
03:58:08.229 --> 03:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
instead of a one-bedroom and so um they
 
03:58:11.110 --> 03:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to use that money for it
 
03:58:13.269 --> 03:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
um but now they don't have extra money
 
03:58:14.590 --> 03:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
so if the child wants a particular and
 
03:58:16.110 --> 03:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about teenagers sometimes
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
or you know middle schoolers and the
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
child goes in and they have you know a
 
03:58:21.870 --> 03:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
shampoo that doesn't work with their
 
03:58:26.269 --> 03:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
hair or they want you know one cool pair
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
of shoes to fit in the family has no
 
03:58:31.870 --> 03:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
money for this the child receives a
 
03:58:35.389 --> 03:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
subsistence money and has no access to
 
03:58:37.710 --> 03:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
it whatsoever because it's being used to
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
reimburse the department department for
 
03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
um services that otherwise does have
 
03:58:44.469 --> 03:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
fory money um State funding to be able
 
03:58:47.309 --> 03:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
to pay for it puts the child and the
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
family at a very severe disadvantage and
 
03:58:53.309 --> 03:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
has very very real consequences on these
 
03:58:56.510 --> 03:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
children so for all of those reasons um
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
nhla strongly supports this bill and is
 
03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you may
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
have knowing that I am a child um
 
03:59:07.149 --> 03:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice and child welfare
 
03:59:09.670 --> 03:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
expert not so much so Social
 
03:59:11.710 --> 03:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
Security thank you councelor will you
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
take questions yes anyone with a
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
03:59:20.309 --> 03:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman um some
 
03:59:21.670 --> 03:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
time ago I during the Clinton
 
03:59:25.149 --> 03:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
Administration I recall a uh law that
 
03:59:27.550 --> 03:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
came through the federal government that
 
03:59:30.510 --> 03:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
um was to push children out of foster
 
03:59:31.990 --> 03:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
care and get them adopted I can't
 
03:59:34.030 --> 03:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
remember the name of the law you may
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
recall I know John does um so I'm trying
 
03:59:39.030 --> 03:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
to figure out where Where Do We Stand
 
03:59:41.149 --> 03:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
how many kids are in uh foster care for
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
how long do they typically stay in
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
foster care I know at the time they were
 
03:59:47.429 --> 03:59:47.439 align:start position:0%
talking about one year yeah so I think
 
03:59:48.790 --> 03:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
that depends I think that's a question
 
03:59:51.189 --> 03:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
the department can better answer I know
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
that in terms of
 
03:59:56.189 --> 03:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
teenagers um you know the the number
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
fluctuates you know probably
 
04:00:01.550 --> 04:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
between I know it's about 200 at any
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
point in time what it is across a year I
 
04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't have that off of the top of my
 
04:00:08.030 --> 04:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
head but when we're talking about you
 
04:00:10.030 --> 04:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
know the broader child Ware population
 
04:00:13.990 --> 04:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm assuming it's a lot larger you
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
had a second question and now I forget
 
04:00:19.030 --> 04:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
it I think you I think you answered it
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay oh oh and how long are they staying
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
so again that depends so some some
 
04:00:26.349 --> 04:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
children you know aren't able to reunify
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
their with their families and they um
 
04:00:31.070 --> 04:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
they do get adopted the the preference
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
in under federal law is always
 
04:00:34.990 --> 04:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
reunification so always what
 
04:00:37.229 --> 04:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
reunification so the state is required
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
to work with the family for at least one
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
year to pursue that reunification unless
 
04:00:44.349 --> 04:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
I think the legislature passed a bill
 
04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
last year that said if there's really no
 
04:00:48.110 --> 04:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of that reunification they
 
04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
can start looking earlier but typically
 
04:00:51.910 --> 04:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
they need to look at reunification for
 
04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
one year what we know in you know as far
 
04:00:57.550 --> 04:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
as as teenagers go we know that once
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
they enter residential placements in
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
particular they stay there for a long
 
04:01:05.389 --> 04:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
time typically more than six months
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
often more than three years okay thank
 
04:01:10.389 --> 04:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I just as
 
04:01:19.830 --> 04:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the bill um lines 9 to 14
 
04:01:21.670 --> 04:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
talk about if a child is already
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits and then it says uh
 
04:01:26.590 --> 04:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
the department shall identify in
 
04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
consultation with the child and the
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
child's representative a representative
 
04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
pay in accordance with uh 20 CFR 404 etc
 
04:01:36.630 --> 04:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
etc and shall apply to become the
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative only if no no other
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
suitable candidate is available I guess
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:01:47.070 --> 04:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
is how is the depart like what are the
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines for the department or I would
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
say maybe the court in deciding whether
 
04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
or not the current representative p is
 
04:01:58.510 --> 04:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
quote unquote suitable under this
 
04:02:00.990 --> 04:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
because based on the presentation my
 
04:02:03.309 --> 04:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
assumption was we're going to let the
 
04:02:04.990 --> 04:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
parent who's currently collecting it
 
04:02:07.229 --> 04:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
continue to collect it unless there's
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
some extraordinary circum cumstances but
 
04:02:11.229 --> 04:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
as I'm reading this now I'm wondering
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
like how do we if this passed how does
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
the division know who's who's
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate and then and suitable and at
 
04:02:22.830 --> 04:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
what point did they then apply yeah so
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
typically the child enters with social
 
04:02:27.149 --> 04:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
security benefits and social security
 
04:02:29.070 --> 04:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
has already made the determination about
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not the parent is suitable so
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
I think what this gets to is If the
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
child already has a representative the
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
department will talk to them to
 
04:02:40.189 --> 04:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they are they
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
continue to be willing to act as the
 
04:02:43.870 --> 04:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
child's representative pay even though
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
the child is no longer living in their
 
04:02:48.229 --> 04:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
home I without having um spoken to the
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor about it I'm not sure that's
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
what this means but if it was if it was
 
04:02:54.149 --> 04:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
patterned on another bill my guess is
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
that that's what this means is that and
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
then if the child is going in and
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
they're identified as potentially
 
04:03:02.469 --> 04:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
eligible for social security benefits
 
04:03:03.870 --> 04:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
and does not currently have a
 
04:03:06.269 --> 04:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
representative P I think that's what
 
04:03:09.469 --> 04:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
this means by a child's representative
 
04:03:12.030 --> 04:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
um in line 11 it says with a child and
 
04:03:13.309 --> 04:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
the child's
 
04:03:15.389 --> 04:03:15.399 align:start position:0%
representative so I think that would
 
04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
refer to a child who is not yet
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
receiving um Social Security benefits
 
04:03:24.630 --> 04:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
and the department would talk to that
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative probably the parent maybe
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
a guardian um to determine who should
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
apply to become the child's
 
04:03:31.439 --> 04:03:32.710 align:start position:0%
apply to become the child's
representative

04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
pay and that the department should only
 
04:03:38.149 --> 04:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
do it if nobody else who is suitable um
 
04:03:40.710 --> 04:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
um is available but but like I said
 
04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
social security has a formula to
 
04:03:47.149 --> 04:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
determine who is a suitable
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
representative pay based on the
 
04:03:52.149 --> 04:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
relationship with the child the um the
 
04:03:56.269 --> 04:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge about the child the um
 
04:03:58.229 --> 04:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
the knowledge of the current and
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
foreseeable needs and then the the
 
04:04:02.429 --> 04:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
custody and proximity relationship than
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
you just a quick followup yeah follow so
 
04:04:08.030 --> 04:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I guess I'm still stuck on the
 
04:04:09.750 --> 04:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
suitability question because what I'm
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
envisioning in my mind is a situation
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
where the child is removed because of
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
say I don't know sexual abuse or extreme
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
violence or you know the murder of
 
04:04:21.870 --> 04:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
another child in the home at what point
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
does the division say well this person
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
is no longer suitable to manage the um
 
04:04:28.030 --> 04:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
monetary best interests of this child
 
04:04:32.429 --> 04:04:32.439 align:start position:0%
because they aren't suitable to manage
 
04:04:34.149 --> 04:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
the other best interest of this child
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
and so I don't I'm I'm curious about how
 
04:04:37.680 --> 04:04:38.790 align:start position:0%
and so I don't I'm I'm curious about how
we

04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
navigate that and how we um make sure
 
04:04:43.229 --> 04:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
that the bill does what it's intended to
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
do which is to make sure that people
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
aren't becoming you know Indigent
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
because their kid went to foster care I
 
04:04:52.590 --> 04:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
I completely understand that so I think
 
04:04:54.630 --> 04:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
I think if the if the person is not
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
acting in the best interest of the child
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
My Hope Is that Social Security would
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
not sanction them as the person who's
 
04:05:02.189 --> 04:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be the representative P
 
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
but there may be somebody else in their
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
life maybe a grandmother who is close
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
like who are they
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
in my mind the most practical solution
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
would be if they're not seeking to
 
04:05:15.630 --> 04:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
reunify with say a sexually abusive
 
04:05:17.469 --> 04:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
parent because that would be harmful to
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
the child who are they seeking to
 
04:05:21.469 --> 04:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
reunify with and is that does that
 
04:05:22.830 --> 04:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
person already maintain a close
 
04:05:24.750 --> 04:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
relationship with them have knowledge of
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
their needs and be able to use these
 
04:05:29.229 --> 04:05:29.239 align:start position:0%
funds in their best interest now if
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
nobody is available I think that's when
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
the department would be step in and and
 
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
potentially become the representative p
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
and that's where other portions of the
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill mandate how they use that money not
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
to reimburse themselves but to make sure
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
that the child's needs that aren't being
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
funded through um you know just as a
 
04:05:49.790 --> 04:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
matter of course you know do they need
 
04:05:52.149 --> 04:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
some shampoo do they need you know
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
something for sports do they need
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
basketball shoes like what do they need
 
04:05:57.710 --> 04:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
and then to the extent that their needs
 
04:05:59.910 --> 04:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
are met to conserve that money up to the
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
resource limit so that they can have it
 
04:06:04.590 --> 04:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
and don't leave custody with lint in
 
04:06:08.510 --> 04:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
their pocket and um
 
04:06:13.550 --> 04:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
adulthood anyone
 
04:06:18.429 --> 04:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
else seeing none thank you so much for
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony now those of you who have
 
04:06:23.229 --> 04:06:23.239 align:start position:0%
filled out pink cards know that besides
 
04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
putting your name you put your address
 
04:06:27.870 --> 04:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
so now the chair recognizes John
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
building and chairman uh my apologies
 
04:06:38.070 --> 04:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
earlier today I at least got it in the
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
129 uh Pleasant Street and we also have
 
04:06:44.510 --> 04:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
with us director uh Jeff ler who will be
 
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
joining me at the table uh I just wanted
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
to start off by thanking the sponsor
 
04:06:54.830 --> 04:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor for uh HB 1598 represent
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
Mary Jane walner she actually took the
 
04:06:58.830 --> 04:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
time and courtesy during the uh time of
 
04:07:01.349 --> 04:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
the LSR filing period in and prior to
 
04:07:03.389 --> 04:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
the sign off to really actively Engage
 
04:07:05.070 --> 04:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
The Department in a conversation around
 
04:07:06.590 --> 04:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and I and the work product
 
04:07:08.910 --> 04:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
that you see before you represents her
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
Earnest desire to creating really good
 
04:07:12.670 --> 04:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
policy here in New Hampshire as well as
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
taking into account from the Department
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of how we would go about
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
doing it um I actually even though I am
 
04:07:20.910 --> 04:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
an active member of the bar my current
 
04:07:22.830 --> 04:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
role is legislative in nature and I
 
04:07:25.309 --> 04:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
really do appreciate also uh the
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
attorney Michelle rangen from the New
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance because I
 
04:07:30.149 --> 04:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
think she provides you with a really
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
good overview over the mechanics behind
 
04:07:37.109 --> 04:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
the bill uh so with that said we we do
 
04:07:39.030 --> 04:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
understand and appreciate the the good
 
04:07:40.109 --> 04:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
works of what this is trying to
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish because currently those
 
04:07:44.189 --> 04:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
benefits that you have like the SSI the
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
Social Security uh um for the disabled
 
04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh that uh the New Hampshire legal
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
assistance was referring to currently
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
when we receive those funds they are
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
deposited back into the general funds as
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to being put into a trust
 
04:08:00.229 --> 04:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
account on behalf of that child so when
 
04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
let's say they do emancipate or age out
 
04:08:04.229 --> 04:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
there could be some funds out there to
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
support you know kids in the future and
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's at least part of the
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
goals also so the immediate needs of
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
dispersement as was described earlier to
 
04:08:14.109 --> 04:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
you would be one of the goals timing is
 
04:08:17.550 --> 04:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
everything in life isn't it and uh we
 
04:08:19.630 --> 04:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
received this past
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
session 160 plus fiscal note worksheet
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
requests from the LBA I'm proud to
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
represent to this committee we have
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
turned in all but about seven of of them
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
so far well over 150 the LBA has been
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
working so hard to catch up with the
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis on bills that it is
 
04:08:37.870 --> 04:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
happening so rapidly that by the time
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
your bills were printed out they
 
04:08:42.870 --> 04:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
magically about an hour or two later
 
04:08:44.670 --> 04:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
actually published if you go online you
 
04:08:47.229 --> 04:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
can actually see the fiscal analysis of
 
04:08:50.070 --> 04:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh I did bring copies
 
04:08:51.990 --> 04:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal analysis that I will leave
 
04:08:54.109 --> 04:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
after our testimony with you just for
 
04:08:56.349 --> 04:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
background information uh but we will
 
04:08:58.670 --> 04:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
need just like the bill that had I had
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
um had the opportunity to chat with you
 
04:09:02.269 --> 04:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
folks before the lunch break this is
 
04:09:03.870 --> 04:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
going to require the collaboration of
 
04:09:06.910 --> 04:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
work with the division 3 uh as it
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
relates to funding this is a very
 
04:09:11.469 --> 04:09:11.479 align:start position:0%
laudable goal that is trying to be
 
04:09:13.830 --> 04:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
achieved by this bill however it does
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
come with mechanics that are different
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
in nature in kind in New Hampshire in
 
04:09:18.590 --> 04:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
other words we have to be very
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
thoughtful in how these funds are
 
04:09:21.990 --> 04:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
administered in other words you have to
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
treat it very much like you would in a
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
guardianship action that if you're
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
trusted with individuals funds you have
 
04:09:28.109 --> 04:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
to account for those funds you have to
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
report out and those are the pieces that
 
04:09:31.630 --> 04:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
the department would be required to
 
04:09:34.030 --> 04:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
doing as part of their work as well so
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
when you do see the fiscal note it will
 
04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
at first reaction you know the the price
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
sticker shock whether it's a used car
 
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
nowadays or I'm sorry pre-owned car or a
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
new car it is it is a dollar amount that
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
we do need to reconcile and working if
 
04:09:48.830 --> 04:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is to proceed forward to
 
04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
giving the department the resources of
 
04:09:52.389 --> 04:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
doing this because in addition to the
 
04:09:54.269 --> 04:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
accounting there would be a need for not
 
04:09:57.070 --> 04:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
only with um uh the director's staff
 
04:09:59.710 --> 04:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
director fers at DCF but also with our
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
legal folks we've identified that the
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys would need to be involved in
 
04:10:05.590 --> 04:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
terms of helping to maintain these funds
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
during the course of the time that we'd
 
04:10:10.469 --> 04:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
be managing those funds um we did work
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
with a couple of really wonderful
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys one was uh attorney Janelle
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
layan I want to give a call out to
 
04:10:17.710 --> 04:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
Janelle she's a department attorney who
 
04:10:19.469 --> 04:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
was the first law clerk in the New
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Probate Court uh back in the
 
04:10:23.469 --> 04:10:23.479 align:start position:0%
90s and we have her now and so she
 
04:10:25.990 --> 04:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
helped with the language of this bill as
 
04:10:29.229 --> 04:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
well as attorney Lori Young who also has
 
04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
a background she worked with the Office
 
04:10:33.389 --> 04:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
of Public guardian and uh she could she
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
would have loved listening to Michelle's
 
04:10:36.510 --> 04:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
testimony because it was exactly I think
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
what Lor's would have been and
 
04:10:40.349 --> 04:10:40.359 align:start position:0%
recognizing uh the the current state of
 
04:10:42.750 --> 04:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
things so with that I am not a social
 
04:10:45.550 --> 04:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
security uh expert in any means but I do
 
04:10:47.229 --> 04:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
know that those who are experts were the
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
ones who helped us put together this
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm confident that the bill is
 
04:10:52.990 --> 04:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
currently drafted is really good but if
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
I draw your attention to page two line
 
04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
25 repon walner was gracious enough to
 
04:11:02.109 --> 04:11:02.119 align:start position:0%
give us language so that we have in
 
04:11:05.349 --> 04:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
there the appropriation language $1
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
although it will get you one hour
 
04:11:08.109 --> 04:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
parking outside of here unless you have
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
a legislative parking permit which you
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
still have to walk a long ways but
 
04:11:12.429 --> 04:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
you'll get a new parking garage over
 
04:11:14.670 --> 04:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
here soon um won't get us to where we
 
04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
need to go so that will be a
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
conversation that will need to be had
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
working with division three I see that
 
04:11:21.109 --> 04:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
we have represent Mooney also in the
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
audience oh she was here uh and she
 
04:11:25.389 --> 04:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
serves on division three so that
 
04:11:27.269 --> 04:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
cross-pollination between your committee
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
and that committee is very critical for
 
04:11:30.750 --> 04:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
this to be a successful piece of
 
04:11:32.269 --> 04:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
legislation so with that I will turn it
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
over to director fer because he will be
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
brilliant and much more brief I'm sure
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
I don't about brilliant but brief thank
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
you John yeah when uh representative
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
Warner approached me with this bill I
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
was very excited about it and we're
 
04:11:48.309 --> 04:11:48.319 align:start position:0%
certainly in full support of it and um
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
but it does come with a cost so I mean
 
04:11:52.910 --> 04:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's all I'll say now but this is a
 
04:11:56.109 --> 04:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
it's a brilliant Bill definitely needed
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to get all the resources
 
04:11:59.469 --> 04:11:59.479 align:start position:0%
to strengthen families as we possibly
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
can and to prepare kids for when they do
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh leave foster care as well so any any
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
dollar that could go toward
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
strengthening a family um a resource for
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
Family Resource for a kid that's been in
 
04:12:12.389 --> 04:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
in care for many years is what we're all
 
04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
about and we really want to push that
 
04:12:14.000 --> 04:12:15.790 align:start position:0%
about and we really want to push that
going

04:12:15.790 --> 04:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
forward any
 
04:12:20.429 --> 04:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:12:23.109 --> 04:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:12:28.030 --> 04:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I agree
 
04:12:31.790 --> 04:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly that um children who
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
become adults and who are aging out of
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
this system really need to have more
 
04:12:38.950 --> 04:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
special attention paid to them because
 
04:12:40.630 --> 04:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
um they're really at a
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
disadvantage um and
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
um two-fold problem I I know that we've
 
04:12:53.910 --> 04:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
talked about adnauseum is that it's not
 
04:12:56.349 --> 04:12:56.359 align:start position:0%
only setting them up
 
04:12:59.710 --> 04:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
personally for failure in a lot of ways
 
04:13:01.109 --> 04:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
right we're not preparing them for
 
04:13:06.189 --> 04:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
adulthood but also um we will isn't it
 
04:13:06.199 --> 04:13:07.750 align:start position:0%
adulthood but also um we will isn't it
true

04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:13:11.550 --> 04:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
that we may need to um pay for services
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
for those specific
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
individuals um in all different ways
 
04:13:23.429 --> 04:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
where um we may not have if they were
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
able to use these funds um and set
 
04:13:32.189 --> 04:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
themselves up um on a better
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
easier healthier path to
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
adulthood um um yeah I think we need
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
both I think you know we're working very
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
hard to provide funding housing for
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
example um uh tuition uh drivers driving
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
lessons and licenses etc for kids after
 
04:13:54.790 --> 04:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
they turn 18 or or move out of our
 
04:13:58.510 --> 04:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
system and this would be an added um
 
04:14:01.510 --> 04:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
resource um to help prepare not only the
 
04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
young person um but whoever they move in
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
with usually it's
 
04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:07.990 align:start position:0%
with usually it's
family

04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
um just a short followup um in in the
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
preparation that you were talking about
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
um is there any sort of um Financial
 
04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
finance um piece that might go to that
 
04:14:23.229 --> 04:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
because you know just as any any young
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
person um suddenly having a windfall
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's $5,000 or $10,000 or
 
04:14:34.349 --> 04:14:34.359 align:start position:0%
$1,000 uh guidance on how to um you know
 
04:14:36.790 --> 04:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
what's the smartest way to spend this
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
money to set yourself up for a better
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
future um is that something that would
 
04:14:46.269 --> 04:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
happen or or plan that you would think
 
04:14:48.030 --> 04:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:14:50.870 --> 04:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
would yeah create a program for yeah we
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
have an adolescent unit um who's run by
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
Rob rodler who's amazing been with the
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
DCF for many years and is an expert in
 
04:15:01.710 --> 04:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
adolesence and helping kids uh graduate
 
04:15:04.109 --> 04:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
from care into the real world so there's
 
04:15:06.149 --> 04:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
an array of services that we can offer
 
04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of federal funding for
 
04:15:11.109 --> 04:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
example we call it the Hope program um
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
so uh and part of that there's another
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill that floated earlier for financial
 
04:15:18.750 --> 04:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh literacy um and I think that's
 
04:15:20.189 --> 04:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
something that we're also very in favor
 
04:15:23.710 --> 04:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
of as well in trying to to do um opening
 
04:15:25.550 --> 04:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
bank accounts helping people to plan and
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
budget their money and things like that
 
04:15:29.269 --> 04:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
so we do have staff and programs that
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
help young people especially older aging
 
04:15:34.670 --> 04:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
out as they say transition young people
 
04:15:36.990 --> 04:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
um so we have both services and some
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
resources like Section 8 um and uh um
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
tuition reimbursements okay thank you
 
04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
for answering my question anyone
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
04:15:52.349 --> 04:15:52.359 align:start position:0%
McMahon thank you Mr
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
chairman uh if I may to the appropriate
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
Authority here on this question is um
 
04:16:00.670 --> 04:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
upon the
 
04:16:02.830 --> 04:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
establishment that the child is in that
 
04:16:04.469 --> 04:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
the child is in the care of the
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
department uh are you custody or
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
Guardian ship what page what line are
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
you reading from um this is page 2 19
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
and 20 thank you yes pardon me Mr
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
chairman I should have said that all
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
right and then I I correlate that
 
04:16:22.429 --> 04:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
statement on page one to line four that
 
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
this is for all children in the care of
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
the department and then line nine saying
 
04:16:28.750 --> 04:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
that if they're already receiving
 
04:16:33.109 --> 04:16:33.119 align:start position:0%
benefits uh does this state that um it
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
happens in both silos in in one case
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
that the the child is being cared is in
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
a care U location and that there's a
 
04:16:46.349 --> 04:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
change that's taking place where they
 
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
become a by label a foster
 
04:16:53.550 --> 04:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
child and then then the state takes
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
takes over as
 
04:16:59.070 --> 04:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
in p on page 2 19 and 20 and then it's
 
04:17:04.590 --> 04:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
child um chairman Pearson in response to
 
04:17:09.070 --> 04:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
represent McMahon's question when it
 
04:17:10.349 --> 04:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
refers to all children it's talking
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
about placement not only with foster
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
care but there's other types of
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
placement with children receiving
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
services that are out of home placement
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
which you're very familiar with in your
 
04:17:20.830 --> 04:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
work um so it would be a much larger
 
04:17:24.269 --> 04:17:24.279 align:start position:0%
universe than the foster children um by
 
04:17:26.429 --> 04:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
way of some statistics earlier today we
 
04:17:29.189 --> 04:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
did testify on the financial literacy um
 
04:17:31.750 --> 04:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
um proving uh legal Authority here in
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for children to be able to
 
04:17:35.550 --> 04:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
cap or in foster care or other
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
placements to opening bank accounts um
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
that the stats that were discussed then
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
were 2,000 children at point in time
 
04:17:45.229 --> 04:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
back in Spring of
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
20023 just last year uh we had in
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
placement with foster care of which uh
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
16 are older which is what this other
 
04:17:55.950 --> 04:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
Bill we were on earlier today uh there
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
are 400 kids that would have been able
 
04:17:59.550 --> 04:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
to Avail themselves it gives you an idea
 
04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
of the universe which you'd be dealing
 
04:18:02.670 --> 04:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
with around foster care but that's not
 
04:18:03.870 --> 04:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
the entire universe because it would
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
also include other placements within the
 
04:18:08.030 --> 04:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
agents through the agency and through
 
04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
the courts one followup Mr chair
 
04:18:14.070 --> 04:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
followup thank you uh specific to
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
the indiv uh the clients if you will
 
04:18:20.429 --> 04:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to do we um do we
 
04:18:21.870 --> 04:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
not know
 
04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
this amount of how many individuals
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
would need this care uh so that the
 
04:18:28.990 --> 04:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
amount of funding for the fiscal note
 
04:18:32.750 --> 04:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to meet those
 
04:18:35.109 --> 04:18:35.119 align:start position:0%
needs my understanding is that this
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislation is designed not to leave any
 
04:18:39.109 --> 04:18:39.119 align:start position:0%
child behind so that the uh agency would
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
be responsible to reviewing for all
 
04:18:42.750 --> 04:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
children in its care and placement for
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
for the benefits under this bill and and
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a number by by name
 
04:18:50.469 --> 04:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
with with a number of how many uh
 
04:18:53.950 --> 04:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
individuals would have this benefit uh
 
04:18:57.870 --> 04:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
provided and G de facto guaranteed so
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
that they're not left alone waiting for
 
04:19:03.429 --> 04:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
an approval yeah and we and certainly
 
04:19:05.149 --> 04:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
that's information that we provided as
 
04:19:07.149 --> 04:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
part of our fiscal analysis and whether
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
or not it's reflected in the fiscal note
 
04:19:10.030 --> 04:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
worksheet even though I've read the bill
 
04:19:11.550 --> 04:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
I've just skimmed over our worksheet
 
04:19:12.990 --> 04:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
because it was just published or I
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say mine it's the lbas it's
 
04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
not our fiscal note but our financial
 
04:19:20.070 --> 04:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
analysis went into that uh clearly if
 
04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
this bill clears the policy committee
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
when you've already heard from the
 
04:19:24.750 --> 04:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
director and myself that we acknowledged
 
04:19:26.590 --> 04:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
that this is very good works on behalf
 
04:19:28.710 --> 04:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
of represent wner in her legislation
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a need for a very
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
thoughtful discussion in the finance
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
area because there are fiscal
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
implications around this bill that do
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
need to be resolved and discussed for a
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
an appropriate amount for resources as
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
well as perhaps um the issue well I I'll
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
leave it at that it can there's some
 
04:19:47.590 --> 04:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
complicating matters that just need to
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
be resolved um financially all right
 
04:19:51.149 --> 04:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
thank you gentlemen thank you Mr
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
chairman anyone
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
else yes representative uh Bickford
 
04:20:00.429 --> 04:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:20:04.109 --> 04:20:04.119 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um would this not create
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent amounts of money for the
 
04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
child that ages out to receive when they
 
04:20:12.750 --> 04:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
age out because of the amount of time
 
04:20:14.469 --> 04:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
that they're in which means the amount
 
04:20:16.309 --> 04:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
of money they would have going into the
 
04:20:16.319 --> 04:20:17.710 align:start position:0%
of money they would have going into the
trust

04:20:17.710 --> 04:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
trust
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
account so in other words one child
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
might get a certain amount because they
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
were in the system for two months
 
04:20:25.950 --> 04:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
another child would get another amount
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
because they were in the system for six
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
months that sound correct yeah it would
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
be into a yeah it' certainly be on a
 
04:20:35.349 --> 04:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
visualized basis um around it currently
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
those children are receiving 0 so I
 
04:20:40.349 --> 04:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
would imagine any uh I think the goal of
 
04:20:42.109 --> 04:20:42.119 align:start position:0%
the bill here is to provide those
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
resources that uh they're entitled to
 
04:20:46.590 --> 04:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
through the um Social Security
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
Administration that and also you'll note
 
04:20:51.469 --> 04:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
that also Veterans Affairs of funding as
 
04:20:54.109 --> 04:20:54.119 align:start position:0%
well is recognized in this legislation
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh that that would be uh safeguarded for
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
for those children whether or not for
 
04:21:01.109 --> 04:21:01.119 align:start position:0%
ongoing expenses during their care or uh
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
upon their exiting uh care from the
 
04:21:07.990 --> 04:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
system that was a long window
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Raymond
 
04:21:15.229 --> 04:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so do we have any idea of how
 
04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
many kids would end up roughly obviously
 
04:21:21.269 --> 04:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh how many kids do we anticipate are
 
04:21:24.910 --> 04:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
going to end up um needing the state to
 
04:21:26.990 --> 04:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
create these accounts for them versus
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
how many have a trusted appropriate
 
04:21:32.269 --> 04:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
adult who would be the one to be the the
 
04:21:34.429 --> 04:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
rep Peay because I mean I would imagine
 
04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
that you know some mom or dad would
 
04:21:39.469 --> 04:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
still be able to be getting that income
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
but others perhaps aren't going to be
 
04:21:44.269 --> 04:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate it would be individualized
 
04:21:47.710 --> 04:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah I think the number we have
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
we're actually I think collecting
 
04:21:53.389 --> 04:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
$500,000 a year in so Security benefits
 
04:21:55.710 --> 04:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
that we then use on behalf of the kids
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
in placement yep so this would change
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
that which is we agree with um uh but
 
04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
that gives you an idea of numbers it's
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
about a half a million a year that uh
 
04:22:08.710 --> 04:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
going to us now to provide services for
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
the kids that could be going directly to
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
the kids and families on individualized
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:19.109 --> 04:22:19.119 align:start position:0%
you you saying no hands up uh thank you
 
04:22:20.910 --> 04:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
and we're looking for your handout which
 
04:22:23.469 --> 04:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
is the fiscal analysis is
 
04:22:26.710 --> 04:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
it that is
 
04:22:29.070 --> 04:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
correct and I'd like the committee to be
 
04:22:31.389 --> 04:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
thinking are we ready to go forward on
 
04:22:35.109 --> 04:22:35.119 align:start position:0%
executing this or not so think about it
 
04:22:40.830 --> 04:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
and think about it as uh the um analysis
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:35.870 align:start position:0%
 
around

04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
he take a look at this um because within
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
about a minute we're going to decide
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
whether we want to go forward with this
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.199 --> 04:24:42.469 align:start position:0%
 
weeks

04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.990 --> 04:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
we were talking at lunch and we were
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:53.149 --> 04:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
1425 yeah let's deal with this but thank
 
04:24:56.910 --> 04:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:56.920 --> 04:25:01.630 align:start position:0%
 
1420

04:25:01.630 --> 04:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.870 --> 04:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
142 okay are we ready to take a straw
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
poll as to whether you think we are
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
ready to vote on this bill before us
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
presently or not
 
04:25:16.269 --> 04:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
down up up up up up up up up down close
 
04:25:24.189 --> 04:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
enough this this this bill here you me
 
04:25:27.030 --> 04:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
the one we're just talking about yeah
 
04:25:27.040 --> 04:25:28.790 align:start position:0%
the one we're just talking about yeah
now

04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:25:33.630 --> 04:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
what not yet wait um remember all the
 
04:25:36.750 --> 04:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal stuff will be be dealt with in
 
04:25:36.760 --> 04:25:37.750 align:start position:0%
fiscal stuff will be be dealt with in
division

04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:25:40.710 --> 04:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
fre uh not that fiscal doesn't matter to
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
us but we're primarily um policy
 
04:25:47.469 --> 04:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
and there may not be the money this year
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
so this may be aspirational for another
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh budget but um so again thumbs up I
 
04:25:57.790 --> 04:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
saw thumbs this away I see thumbs I
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
don't see THB we sort of ran out of
 
04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
thumbs here getting better up or
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
down um I see enough to proceed to
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with this bill right now so
 
04:26:16.469 --> 04:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
therefore I close the hearing on House
 
04:26:21.149 --> 04:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 1598 and I open the exec session on
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1598 and the chair will
 
04:26:28.229 --> 04:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:31.750 --> 04:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
motion uh representative
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
ball your motion I would make a motion
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
to OTP OTP moved by ball I would like a
 
04:26:41.429 --> 04:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
Democrat for a second representative
 
04:26:47.710 --> 04:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
discussion what's that you may have a
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
discuss okay thank you Mr
 
04:26:56.229 --> 04:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
chairman I just feel that this is the
 
04:26:59.830 --> 04:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
wrong way to go about it this um these
 
04:27:01.469 --> 04:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
Social Security benefits the children
 
04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
are for their support it's not for a
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
savings account to be used at after
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
their age of majority of which they can
 
04:27:10.910 --> 04:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
go g get that apartment or they can go
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
get some drugs but they get whatever
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
they want it's to help support the child
 
04:27:19.710 --> 04:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
that's what it's for so to say that we
 
04:27:23.070 --> 04:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
don't want the state to get paid is is
 
04:27:25.630 --> 04:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
is wrong uh for the reimbursement
 
04:27:26.830 --> 04:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
because they need to collect child
 
04:27:26.840 --> 04:27:28.429 align:start position:0%
because they need to collect child
support

04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
too and and just think if we hand the
 
04:27:33.070 --> 04:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
money over to the child when they come
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
to age majority the neighbor someone
 
04:27:37.950 --> 04:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
down the Street's gonna say well how
 
04:27:39.550 --> 04:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
come I don't give money to give to my
 
04:27:41.790 --> 04:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
children I used all mine up to support
 
04:27:41.800 --> 04:27:42.469 align:start position:0%
children I used all mine up to support
the

04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:45.309 --> 04:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
children so it it's wrong in that
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
respect um if we did a stipend for every
 
04:27:51.389 --> 04:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
child in state after they age out well
 
04:27:52.429 --> 04:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
fair but this isn't fair to the
 
04:27:57.870 --> 04:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
public thank
 
04:28:00.550 --> 04:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:28:04.109 --> 04:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman
 
04:28:07.309 --> 04:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
and I actually agree with uh
 
04:28:08.910 --> 04:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford about the money
 
04:28:10.790 --> 04:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
being for the support of the child
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
that's the the purpose of it um but I
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
can tell you that when I worked for DCF
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and when I worked
 
04:28:20.349 --> 04:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
for a child protective in New York I had
 
04:28:24.030 --> 04:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
families who needed that SSI or SSDI
 
04:28:26.590 --> 04:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
payment in order to pay their rent and
 
04:28:28.830 --> 04:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
the most heartbreaking thing is when you
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
are working with a family who cannot
 
04:28:33.389 --> 04:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
support the child in their home for a
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons maybe you know
 
04:28:37.750 --> 04:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
because of abuse or neglect or some
 
04:28:39.149 --> 04:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
other struggle and then you're working
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
with the parent to correct their
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
parenting challenges but they lose their
 
04:28:47.070 --> 04:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
home because they've lost the income
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
that they needed and so now the parent
 
04:28:51.109 --> 04:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
is doing what they need to do they're
 
04:28:53.229 --> 04:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
taking the classes they're going to
 
04:28:54.950 --> 04:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
treatment they're doing their parenting
 
04:28:56.990 --> 04:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
time with their child but the kid can't
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
be reunified because they have no place
 
04:29:01.630 --> 04:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
to live and we can't send kids back to
 
04:29:03.790 --> 04:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
someone who's homeless and I've I've
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
seen it more times than I can count on
 
04:29:08.389 --> 04:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
my fingers and it like it still breaks
 
04:29:10.590 --> 04:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
my heart and I've been out of the the
 
04:29:14.030 --> 04:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
field for 10 years now um so for me I'm
 
04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
going to support it because based on the
 
04:29:19.269 --> 04:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
questions I was asking earlier um My
 
04:29:22.189 --> 04:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hope cross my fingers is that the bulk
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
of this money would be staying with the
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
current rep PE or other appropriate rep
 
04:29:29.590 --> 04:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
PE that would help these families not
 
04:29:31.670 --> 04:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
become homeless and given our our
 
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
current housing crisis I the idea that
 
04:29:36.030 --> 04:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
we might be responsible for someone
 
04:29:37.630 --> 04:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
becoming homeless while they're trying
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
to correct the parenting mistakes that
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
led to their child going out of the
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
house just it breaks my heart so that's
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
where my support comes from my hope is
 
04:29:46.950 --> 04:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
that we won't have very many of these
 
04:29:50.070 --> 04:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
accounts because kids will have an adult
 
04:29:52.510 --> 04:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
who can take them back any
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%

nurses and
 
04:32:32.109 --> 04:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
physician assistance and I'm talking
 
04:32:33.990 --> 04:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
slow to get the prime sponsor to the
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
table representative law thank
 
04:32:39.910 --> 04:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative long representing
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 23
 
04:32:47.830 --> 04:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester um Al schille 1590 was
 
04:32:51.870 --> 04:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
brought forward uh through um currently
 
04:32:54.109 --> 04:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
there's training regarding uh child
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and uh what we're what
 
04:32:58.990 --> 04:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
they're noticing is that there aren't a
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
lot of upper level uh medical providers
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
that are taking that training for one
 
04:33:10.109 --> 04:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
obvious reason is time constraint um uh
 
04:33:12.670 --> 04:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
and being transparent also they're
 
04:33:15.910 --> 04:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
speaking with a few of the uh proponents
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
of this uh there they did have some
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
amendments that they would like to look
 
04:33:23.551 --> 04:33:23.561 align:start position:0%
at I didn't want to bring those in now
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh so that I could hear all the
 
04:33:26.629 --> 04:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
testimony and make sure we have
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
everything covered um I think it's
 
04:33:32.670 --> 04:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
important to um to have training and
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
identifying uh abuse and neglect uh
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
there are some there are some facilities
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh there are some organizations that
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
mandate it and there then there are
 
04:33:44.429 --> 04:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
others that don't they just ask people
 
04:33:47.789 --> 04:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
to take it at their time uh there is an
 
04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
online uh um there is an online module
 
04:33:54.189 --> 04:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
that you could follow in order to get
 
04:33:54.199 --> 04:33:54.990 align:start position:0%
that you could follow in order to get
this

04:33:54.990 --> 04:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:33:59.310 --> 04:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
training um so I asked that the uh
 
04:34:01.990 --> 04:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee look at this and and and
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
um help us in being assur
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
that all pertinent people that see the
 
04:34:13.869 --> 04:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
children on a regular basis um have this
 
04:34:17.109 --> 04:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
training in order to identify uh abuse
 
04:34:17.119 --> 04:34:18.349 align:start position:0%
training in order to identify uh abuse
or

04:34:18.349 --> 04:34:18.359 align:start position:0%

Cassandra Sanchez I am the child
 
04:34:53.830 --> 04:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for the State of New
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today in support of
 
04:34:58.590 --> 04:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:35:01.390 --> 04:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
1590 and I wanted to share with you an
 
04:35:03.551 --> 04:35:03.561 align:start position:0%
experience that my office had in
 
04:35:06.029 --> 04:35:06.039 align:start position:0%
reviewing some cases is involving abuse
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
and neglect of young babies over this
 
04:35:11.949 --> 04:35:11.959 align:start position:0%
past year so starting between February
 
04:35:14.150 --> 04:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
and June 2023 the office of the child
 
04:35:17.150 --> 04:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
advocate identified nine cases of
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
non-ambulatory babies that presented to
 
04:35:21.949 --> 04:35:21.959 align:start position:0%
emergency departments with broken
 
04:35:24.750 --> 04:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
bones after finding these cases and
 
04:35:26.109 --> 04:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
working with the medical
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
community it was determined that two of
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
these cases the babies had been brought
 
04:35:33.990 --> 04:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
to their pediatrician prior to arriving
 
04:35:36.109 --> 04:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
to an emergency department
 
04:35:37.470 --> 04:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
one of them had been seen by an
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
emergency room doctor before being seen
 
04:35:43.070 --> 04:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
by a pediatric specialist in child abuse
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
and neglect whom all those three the two
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
pediatricians and the initial Ed doctor
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
none of them called in abuse and neglect
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
to DCF for these babies and in each of
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
these cases the babies had multiple
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
broken bones not just one many of them
 
04:36:02.789 --> 04:36:02.799 align:start position:0%
six or more
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
ribs in the work that we did we worked
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
very closely with
 
04:36:10.109 --> 04:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
DCF um who worked very quickly to try to
 
04:36:12.189 --> 04:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
gather medical records work with the
 
04:36:16.109 --> 04:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
hospital that did ultimately file and
 
04:36:18.670 --> 04:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
act protectively and file in court in
 
04:36:20.230 --> 04:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
some of these cases because of the
 
04:36:22.869 --> 04:36:22.879 align:start position:0%
initial doctor visit they were not
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
successful in court and ultimately the
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
children were returned to the home of
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
the the parents which it was unclear who
 
04:36:32.349 --> 04:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator was but it was known in
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
all of these cases that the two parents
 
04:36:36.029 --> 04:36:36.039 align:start position:0%
were the primary caregivers of the
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
children when these injuries
 
04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
occurred given the large amount of these
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
that occurred in such a short period of
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
time the office of child advocate held
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
what what we call our system review
 
04:36:49.230 --> 04:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
mappings and so what we do with the
 
04:36:52.750 --> 04:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
mappings are we um present pre- inters
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
with folks that have been involved in
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
some of these cases and then we bring
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
together Professionals in the field
 
04:37:01.230 --> 04:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
staff from DCF um these also included
 
04:37:02.551 --> 04:37:02.561 align:start position:0%
medical professionals and law
 
04:37:05.070 --> 04:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement in in the specific mapping
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
that we did in August
 
04:37:09.390 --> 04:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
2023 and the hope of this mapping was to
 
04:37:11.789 --> 04:37:11.799 align:start position:0%
come up with some recommendations to
 
04:37:13.510 --> 04:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
ensure further protections of these
 
04:37:15.349 --> 04:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
types of cases in the
 
04:37:17.349 --> 04:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
future what we learned during the
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
mapping was that training for medical
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
professionals was not always mandated
 
04:37:26.310 --> 04:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
and was a current need that exists there
 
04:37:28.269 --> 04:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
is also some other legislation that you
 
04:37:30.750 --> 04:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
will see this session that also stem
 
04:37:32.949 --> 04:37:32.959 align:start position:0%
from this um there's two Senate bills
 
04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 459 that Focus on the
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm with babies with
 
04:37:40.029 --> 04:37:40.039 align:start position:0%
broken bones as well as um Senate Bill
 
04:37:41.709 --> 04:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
472 which talks about the
 
04:37:43.830 --> 04:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary team and looking for
 
04:37:45.551 --> 04:37:45.561 align:start position:0%
a study committee to ensure that those
 
04:37:47.551 --> 04:37:47.561 align:start position:0%
teams can communicate and share
 
04:37:49.949 --> 04:37:49.959 align:start position:0%
documents fluidly to ensure the safety
 
04:37:52.709 --> 04:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
of children and so those along with this
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
house bill would help address the issues
 
04:37:57.750 --> 04:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
on cases like these we know these are
 
04:38:00.269 --> 04:38:00.279 align:start position:0%
just a handful of the cases that come
 
04:38:04.109 --> 04:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
across DCF or don't um if medical
 
04:38:05.310 --> 04:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
profession the initial medical
 
04:38:07.590 --> 04:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
professionals don't recognize abuse and
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
neglect and so we are truly hoping that
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
this training can be mandated so that
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
all providers who are oftentimes the
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
first Contact for children who have
 
04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
serious injuries are trained and are
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
able to recognize these injuries and
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
call into the agency so they can act
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
protectively I am open to any questions
 
04:38:30.670 --> 04:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Raymond thank
 
04:38:32.910 --> 04:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
you um thank you for Mr chairman and
 
04:38:34.990 --> 04:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so um
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
um 100 years ago when I worked for DCF
 
04:38:39.949 --> 04:38:39.959 align:start position:0%
it was the DCF um workers who were going
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
out and talking to the doctor's offices
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
and stuff who does the training
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
now there is the no andell training um
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
which is hosted by the um New Hampshire
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
Alliance I'm sorry I'm going to be
 
04:38:55.510 --> 04:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
blanking on their acronym right now um
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
which is available um and is voluntary
 
04:39:01.150 --> 04:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
training um I do I do know in working
 
04:39:03.070 --> 04:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
with DCF that they do have staff that
 
04:39:04.390 --> 04:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
does continue to meet with the medical
 
04:39:06.670 --> 04:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
community as well um again on a
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis so a lot of the
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals are open to inviting in dcyf
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
to do those trainings to talk about what
 
04:39:16.029 --> 04:39:16.039 align:start position:0%
they're seeing in the field um and my
 
04:39:18.029 --> 04:39:18.039 align:start position:0%
office as well has been called in to
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
some professional groups to talk about
 
04:39:21.869 --> 04:39:21.879 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in the field of abuse
 
04:39:24.029 --> 04:39:24.039 align:start position:0%
and neglect um but because none of those
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
are mandated it's who has the time and
 
04:39:29.709 --> 04:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
the interest to call in those follow up
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
follow up do you know what other states
 
04:39:33.949 --> 04:39:33.959 align:start position:0%
are doing are there is there like a a
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
medical associ a or some you know agency
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
that would provide these type of
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
training for you know for example
 
04:39:42.788 --> 04:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
doctors it's hard for a social worker
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
with a bachelors or a masters to tell a
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
doctor what to look for sometimes are
 
04:39:49.990 --> 04:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
there you know certified groups or
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
licensed groups that do it well I can
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
speak from my background I'm working in
 
04:39:55.350 --> 04:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and in Massachusetts
 
04:39:56.708 --> 04:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
doctors are considered mandated
 
04:39:58.190 --> 04:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
reporters and so they are required to
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
take the mandated reporter training and
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
um stay up toate on the mandated
 
04:40:03.868 --> 04:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
reporter training and so that is
 
04:40:06.628 --> 04:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
something that was required there that
 
04:40:08.350 --> 04:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
anybody who is considered a mandated
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
reporter which would be a professional
 
04:40:12.190 --> 04:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
level including doctors would take and
 
04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
then they could Outreach the agency for
 
04:40:15.670 --> 04:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
additional supports but the at minimum
 
04:40:17.708 --> 04:40:17.718 align:start position:0%
we getting that training and it was
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
required thank you
 
04:40:23.788 --> 04:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for speaking um
 
04:40:30.990 --> 04:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
to this bill I just had I'm sorry I this
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
really hit me so just give me a second
 
04:40:36.670 --> 04:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
to remember my
 
04:40:36.680 --> 04:40:38.270 align:start position:0%
to remember my
question

04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
um regarding the training um who decides
 
04:40:46.670 --> 04:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
what's uh AC acceptable training um for
 
04:40:48.628 --> 04:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
example somebody um might say oh I'm
 
04:40:50.788 --> 04:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
taking this online training course but
 
04:40:52.590 --> 04:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
who is actually going to say that's an
 
04:40:56.110 --> 04:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
acceptable level of information that's
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
given like who is going to be um in
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
charge of deciding what's acceptable
 
04:41:04.990 --> 04:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
training and all also who else is going
 
04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
to be in charge of keeping the records
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
of people who
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
are who are um require mandated required
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
to to take these trainings that is a
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
great question I do not have the answer
 
04:41:21.190 --> 04:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
to that question so I'm going to defer
 
04:41:23.230 --> 04:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
okay medical professionals of those of
 
04:41:25.350 --> 04:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
you who have signed up on pink cards the
 
04:41:27.070 --> 04:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
first one who knows the answer please
 
04:41:29.070 --> 04:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
say so thank
 
04:41:31.350 --> 04:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
panck thank you uh chairman for allowing
 
04:41:36.830 --> 04:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
me asked my question and thank you for
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I had a
 
04:41:42.110 --> 04:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
professional license and we were
 
04:41:45.150 --> 04:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
required to do ceu
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
hours uh we'd have to have 12 ceu
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
hours uh every two
 
04:41:51.120 --> 04:41:53.590 align:start position:0%
hours uh every two
years

04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:41:58.350 --> 04:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
uh why we why are you asking to have
 
04:42:02.948 --> 04:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.510 --> 04:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
years I don't have the specifics as to
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
why it was requested every two years I
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
am in support of the request for every
 
04:42:12.190 --> 04:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
two years because it is important to
 
04:42:14.910 --> 04:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
stay up to date um information changes
 
04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
on child abuse and neglect that's
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
something that my office spends a lot of
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
time being trained on ourselves to
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are constantly in the no
 
04:42:23.350 --> 04:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
and so being updated every two years
 
04:42:25.708 --> 04:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
would ensure that as research changes as
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
information changes they would get those
 
04:42:30.190 --> 04:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
updates as well follow follow up okay
 
04:42:33.390 --> 04:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um I see that in the budget
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
all right um um the first year is going
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
to cost
 
04:42:40.510 --> 04:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
$25,000 the second year it
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
doubles um I don't understand why it
 
04:42:47.070 --> 04:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
would double in one year um just looking
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
explanation I would have to defer that
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
question as well I'm not sure the the
 
04:42:53.280 --> 04:42:55.788 align:start position:0%
question as well I'm not sure the the
budgeting

04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:59.070 --> 04:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
amount anyone
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
else thank you for your testimony thank

04:43:21.470 --> 04:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
paradox no one listen to
 
04:43:26.390 --> 04:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:30.150 --> 04:43:30.160 align:start position:0%

of New Hampshire children with concerns
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
for abuse and neglect we're here to
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
describe a pervasive problem in New
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that endangers children who've
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:00.868 --> 04:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
maltreatment thank you Wendy good
 
04:44:03.788 --> 04:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is re M oral I'm the
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
medical director dor of the child
 
04:44:07.628 --> 04:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
advocacy and protection program at
 
04:44:10.830 --> 04:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth for The Last 5 Years in my
 
04:44:13.470 --> 04:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
career and tenure at Dartmouth I have
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
seen many children who presented to
 
04:44:19.910 --> 04:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
Medical providers either in Primary Care
 
04:44:23.750 --> 04:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
setting or emergency rooms with all the
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
signs and symptoms of child abuse and
 
04:44:29.550 --> 04:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
neglect but their diagnoses and
 
04:44:33.070 --> 04:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
recognition of child abuse was sorely
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
missed as a result result of which they
 
04:44:38.708 --> 04:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
were injured and harmed and suffered uh
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
from pain I would like to give you a
 
04:44:43.390 --> 04:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
couple of examples for instance a
 
04:44:43.400 --> 04:44:45.230 align:start position:0%
couple of examples for instance a
four-month-old

04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
four-month-old
 
04:44:49.788 --> 04:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
infant uh had had 12 visits to their New
 
04:44:53.070 --> 04:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire primary care provider uh since
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
one month of age for failure to gain
 
04:44:58.830 --> 04:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
weight repeated bruising signs of head
 
04:45:01.070 --> 04:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
and mouth injury and rectal
 
04:45:04.390 --> 04:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
bleeding at least on four of those
 
04:45:07.788 --> 04:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
visits there were very concerning
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
complaints from the parent and findings
 
04:45:14.590 --> 04:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
that the primary care provider
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
documented but they still failed uh to
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
file a report with DCF and simply
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
accepted the implausible explanations
 
04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
provided by the
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
caretakers thus the opportunities to
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
report to DCF were sorely Miss missed
 
04:45:38.430 --> 04:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
and eventually the infant at 4 months of
 
04:45:42.350 --> 04:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
age presented to an emergency room with
 
04:45:46.070 --> 04:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
malnutrition diarrhea onethird of the
 
04:45:50.430 --> 04:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
tongue torn from the bottom of the mouth
 
04:45:52.110 --> 04:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
from the floor of the mouth that
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
required surgery and a Severe gum
 
04:46:00.510 --> 04:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
laceration and the infant is now 17
 
04:46:04.868 --> 04:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
months a of age in fostter care uh
 
04:46:10.110 --> 04:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
with uh injuries uh to the mouth that
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
will affect dental health and with all
 
04:46:15.708 --> 04:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
the pain that they suffered for four
 
04:46:20.750 --> 04:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
months uh of duration we expect that
 
04:46:23.310 --> 04:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
there will be long-term mental health
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
and physical health difficulties for
 
04:46:25.560 --> 04:46:26.430 align:start position:0%
and physical health difficulties for
this

04:46:26.430 --> 04:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:46:29.788 --> 04:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
child this is a good example of how the
 
04:46:32.510 --> 04:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
lack of recognition of obvious signs of
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and failure to engage
 
04:46:41.470 --> 04:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
DCF result in escalation of injury and
 
04:46:43.708 --> 04:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
ongoing suffering for the child which
 
04:46:45.788 --> 04:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
may cause lifelong
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
difficulties cases like this are
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately very common just as uh the
 
04:46:55.990 --> 04:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
previous speaker uh relayed this is
 
04:46:59.788 --> 04:46:59.798 align:start position:0%
because healthc care providers don't
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
consistently recognize signs of abuse
 
04:47:06.030 --> 04:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
and neglect or or they inadequately
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
address concerns for possible
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
maltreatment with incomplete evaluations
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
or they don't report suspected abuse and
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
neglect uh to DCF at all I would like to
 
04:47:21.628 --> 04:47:21.638 align:start position:0%
share with you another case
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
example and with both of these cases I
 
04:47:27.230 --> 04:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
personally was involved I would like to
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
let you know a 5-month-old infant was
 
04:47:32.270 --> 04:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
seen at an emergency room in New
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of br bruises on their
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
back the child's caretaker attributed
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
these to someone else that was present
 
04:47:45.310 --> 04:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
in the home previously an incomplete
 
04:47:47.788 --> 04:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
medical evaluation was done by the
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
emergency room doctor even though at
 
04:47:56.910 --> 04:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
such young age such unexplained bruising
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh represent Sentinel injuries that
 
04:48:05.310 --> 04:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
should trigger a DCF evaluation and all
 
04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
caretakers of the child to be considered
 
04:48:08.718 --> 04:48:10.390 align:start position:0%
caretakers of the child to be considered
suspect

04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
suspect
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
perpetrators uh this was not done and
 
04:48:17.708 --> 04:48:17.718 align:start position:0%
the emergency room physician accepted uh
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
the uh explanations as fact and the
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
child was returned to their caretaker
 
04:48:29.310 --> 04:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
only to return to an intensive care unit
 
04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
with severe abusive head trauma findings
 
04:48:34.510 --> 04:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
before DC
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
was able to get into the house at four
 
04:48:42.910 --> 04:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
years of age now this child is living uh
 
04:48:46.110 --> 04:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
with severe and permanent developmental
 
04:48:49.990 --> 04:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
impairment they are bedbound tube fed
 
04:48:53.590 --> 04:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
blind and dealing with a seizure
 
04:48:56.708 --> 04:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
disorder this is another good example of
 
04:49:00.270 --> 04:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
how incomplete work up by a physician
 
04:49:02.788 --> 04:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
and acceptance of the caretaker's blame
 
04:49:05.230 --> 04:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
of someone else to account for a very
 
04:49:08.670 --> 04:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
young infant's injuries may result in
 
04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
Failure to protect the child this
 
04:49:15.030 --> 04:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
child's uh previous bruising injuries
 
04:49:18.750 --> 04:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
would have healed perfectly fine had
 
04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
this child not been return to the
 
04:49:24.190 --> 04:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
concerning environment in their uh
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
household and avoided the devastating
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
outcome they are now living with these
 
04:49:33.868 --> 04:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
are only two of many cases I ENC
 
04:49:36.430 --> 04:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
enountered in New Hampshire some of them
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
died some of them survived like the
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
second case with major handicaps and
 
04:49:45.430 --> 04:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
some of them suffered pain with residual
 
04:49:47.708 --> 04:49:47.718 align:start position:0%
physical and mental health
 
04:49:51.510 --> 04:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
problems and all of these outcomes can
 
04:49:56.230 --> 04:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
be avoided if we are able to train our
 
04:50:00.070 --> 04:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
medical providers who are the ones to
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
recognize child abuse and neglect when
 
04:50:04.548 --> 04:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
these children Pres sent to their
 
04:50:08.310 --> 04:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
clinics or emergency rooms and that is
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
why I'm here to ask you to take that
 
04:50:14.270 --> 04:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
step along with my colleague Wendy
 
04:50:17.470 --> 04:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
Gladstone uh to help the legislature
 
04:50:21.310 --> 04:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
pass House Bill 1590 so that our state's
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
child health care providers complete a
 
04:50:26.470 --> 04:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
recognized and accredited course every
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
two years this would mean we put
 
04:50:32.310 --> 04:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
children's well-being first thank
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
you any questions questions for the
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:42.390 --> 04:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
Grossman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:50:44.190 --> 04:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
you both for being here to do such
 
04:50:48.150 --> 04:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
important work um really appreciate this
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
my question is currently in medical
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
school right
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
now is there any training related to
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
child abuse and neglect and I asked this
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
question coming from a parent with a
 
04:51:06.430 --> 04:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
child with autism who who 15 years ago
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
was misdiagnosed because the training
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite there yet the way it is now
 
04:51:14.270 --> 04:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
we also know child abuse and neglect
 
04:51:16.350 --> 04:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
Education and Training has come a long
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
way into terms of educating our
 
04:51:22.350 --> 04:51:22.360 align:start position:0%
community so in medical school is there
 
04:51:25.830 --> 04:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
any and that may be 20 years behind but
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
04:51:31.708 --> 04:51:31.718 align:start position:0%
training there is but it is only a few
 
04:51:35.590 --> 04:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
hours long only to create an awareness
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
of oh children are abused even in their
 
04:51:43.868 --> 04:51:43.878 align:start position:0%
homes but no skill set is provided to
 
04:51:47.590 --> 04:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
either medical students or residents in
 
04:51:50.948 --> 04:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
any specialty that they do in Pediatrics
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
as a result even a specialty uh trained
 
04:51:58.030 --> 04:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
physician when they start working as a
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
pediatrician they don't have full
 
04:52:02.990 --> 04:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of how to recognize child
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
abuse anding nect nor do they know
 
04:52:09.830 --> 04:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
specifically how child protection system
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
works and what mandatory reporting
 
04:52:15.270 --> 04:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
really means in New Hampshire but Dr
 
04:52:17.070 --> 04:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
Gladstone may say
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
more um yes there already is training it
 
04:52:24.590 --> 04:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
part of schooling is required by the
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
Council on medical education it's
 
04:52:28.350 --> 04:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
required as part of training whether
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
you're a resident in Pediatrics or
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
family practice or advanced practice
 
04:52:38.230 --> 04:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
nurse or PA physician assistant um as Dr
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
Ral pointed out part of the purpose of
 
04:52:45.150 --> 04:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
this education is to provide uh medical
 
04:52:48.390 --> 04:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
caregivers with specific skills how do I
 
04:52:50.150 --> 04:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
talk to a child who makes a disclosure
 
04:52:52.350 --> 04:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
during a physical exam how do I talk to
 
04:52:54.350 --> 04:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
a parent I've been taking care of their
 
04:52:56.110 --> 04:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
kids for years and suddenly I have to
 
04:52:58.110 --> 04:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
say I'm concerned someone's mistreating
 
04:53:00.350 --> 04:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
their child and I'm going to report that
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
to Child Protection agencies so these
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
are skill sets that are not typically
 
04:53:08.030 --> 04:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
taught early on they're not part of the
 
04:53:11.830 --> 04:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
annual education that hospitals require
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
their uh employees to take um we also
 
04:53:18.910 --> 04:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
included in our recommendations that
 
04:53:21.830 --> 04:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
providers learn the specific laws in New
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are important to know
 
04:53:27.190 --> 04:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
such as we have a religious exemption in
 
04:53:30.110 --> 04:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire most providers get their
 
04:53:32.470 --> 04:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
Education and Training in other states
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
before they come to work here they need
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
to learn how things go in New
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would like to ask uh the
 
04:53:42.670 --> 04:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who made the assertion that this
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
is not being done in medical schools how
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
many medical schools are you
 
04:53:50.670 --> 04:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
specifically aware of I am parttime CEO
 
04:53:53.670 --> 04:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
of a medical facility and I have people
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh Physicians and nurse practitioners
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
who've been trained in various places
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
and I think you made a broad
 
04:54:02.480 --> 04:54:05.150 align:start position:0%
and I think you made a broad
generalization

04:54:05.150 --> 04:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
generalization
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh correct and uh that knowledge comes
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
from uh multiple medical schools that I
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
had uh professional experience in and um
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
I know what residency programs require
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
they are so packed with mandatory
 
04:54:27.150 --> 04:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
training uh sections for residents and
 
04:54:30.350 --> 04:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
for medical students as well child abuse
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
and neglect is learned by medical
 
04:54:36.350 --> 04:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
students and residents only if they
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
elect to do a child abuse
 
04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
rotation as they do in my hospital as
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
they did at other couple of universities
 
04:54:51.270 --> 04:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
that I worked at uh and I have no reason
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
to doubt that it is any different in uh
 
04:54:57.910 --> 04:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
other uh medical students and another
 
04:54:59.868 --> 04:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
point that I would like to make I don't
 
04:55:01.548 --> 04:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
know if this question is going to come
 
04:55:07.470 --> 04:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
up or not but but uh most major
 
04:55:12.788 --> 04:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
hospitals do have a mandatory training
 
04:55:17.070 --> 04:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
for uh orientation purposes when any
 
04:55:20.030 --> 04:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
employee starts to work in that
 
04:55:20.040 --> 04:55:21.350 align:start position:0%
employee starts to work in that
particular

04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:55:25.470 --> 04:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
facility but those trainings are very
 
04:55:29.470 --> 04:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
limited too simply to remind the
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
employees that they are mandatory
 
04:55:36.150 --> 04:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
reporters they need to file a report
 
04:55:39.430 --> 04:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
with DCF when they recognize child abuse
 
04:55:43.110 --> 04:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
and neglect and it stops there okay we
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
are going to need to move on we are
 
04:55:46.830 --> 04:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
repeating ourselves and we have several
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
other people I do wish to hear from so
 
04:55:52.230 --> 04:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
all right representative Raymond thank
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry I have the thank you Mr
 
04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
chairman I have the same question as
 
04:55:58.948 --> 04:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
before is they are an
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
accredited um group agency whatever that
 
04:56:04.430 --> 04:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
does this training so that if we were to
 
04:56:06.750 --> 04:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation hospitals and
 
04:56:09.150 --> 04:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
doctor's offices could say okay that's
 
04:56:10.670 --> 04:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
that's the provider that's where I go so
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
that I can be in
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
compliance would you like to Yes um
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
there is currently a voluntary
 
04:56:20.670 --> 04:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
accredited program in New Hampshire that
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
is specifically designed for health care
 
04:56:25.230 --> 04:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
providers and specifically addresses all
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
the components we've discussed here it's
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
three hours
 
04:56:34.548 --> 04:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
long um and there was a mention of a
 
04:56:36.430 --> 04:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to change the
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
language of this legislation from two to
 
04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
three hours um the importance is that
 
04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
whatever training is received is
 
04:56:45.548 --> 04:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
accredited meaning it's evidence-based
 
04:56:48.110 --> 04:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
on scientific principles and it's
 
04:56:51.070 --> 04:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
recognized meaning that it's understood
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
that the materials covered address these
 
04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
specific problems that we've identified
 
04:56:57.310 --> 04:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:57:01.310 --> 04:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
recognition evaluation reporting and
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
understanding the laws in New Hampshire
 
04:57:05.070 --> 04:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
I may have missed it but what was the
 
04:57:07.708 --> 04:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
name of this organization who does this
 
04:57:10.510 --> 04:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
the granite state Children's Alliance
 
04:57:13.150 --> 04:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
which is the a parent company for the
 
04:57:15.390 --> 04:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
network of child advocacy centers in New
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they were unable to come today
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
but we have a letter from them of suppor
 
04:57:22.230 --> 04:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
in this Bill thank you and other doctor
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
I will need you to fill out a pink card
 
04:57:31.948 --> 04:57:31.958 align:start position:0%

already okay thank you all right
 
04:57:35.798 --> 04:57:37.670 align:start position:0%
already okay thank you all right
representative

04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
Nelson hello um thank you Mr chairman
 
04:57:43.708 --> 04:57:43.718 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question my
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
I asked this question before um I'm not
 
04:57:49.470 --> 04:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
sure if um you um going to be able to
 
04:57:52.948 --> 04:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
answer this um but who is going to keep
 
04:57:55.350 --> 04:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
track of all of these medical uh
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
professionals to make sure they're in
 
04:57:58.350 --> 04:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
compliance with
 
04:58:03.470 --> 04:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
this um the bill states that the um any
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
provider seeing children in New
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who's a physician advanced
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
practice nurse or physicians's assistant
 
04:58:16.990 --> 04:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
um will have this uh training be um
 
04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
supervised or counted by their employee
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't tie it to lure because you can
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire and practice under
 
04:58:28.548 --> 04:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
for example a nursing license that you
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
got in another state and so if you
 
04:58:32.910 --> 04:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
already have that license you don't have
 
04:58:37.230 --> 04:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
to to get additional lure in New
 
04:58:39.788 --> 04:58:39.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and that so we thought that
 
04:58:42.110 --> 04:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
if we tied it to lure we would miss all
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
those people that's why it's related to
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
the employer not the Licensing Bureau
 
04:58:52.470 --> 04:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
followup um I think this is great um and
 
04:58:54.868 --> 04:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I don't want you to think that
 
04:58:58.470 --> 04:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
I'm knocking the bill I'm just a little
 
04:59:00.548 --> 04:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
bit stuck on and thank you for thank you
 
04:59:02.110 --> 04:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
for answering that but I'm just still a
 
04:59:03.788 --> 04:59:03.798 align:start position:0%
little stuck on
 
04:59:06.670 --> 04:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
how are we going to make who how do we
 
04:59:13.110 --> 04:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
make um the employers the hospitals the
 
04:59:16.430 --> 04:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
practices accountable to making sure
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
their people are complying with this is
 
04:59:22.590 --> 04:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
there a a reporting system
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
to somewhere in HHS
 
04:59:31.390 --> 04:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
or uh it is actually quite easily doable
 
04:59:34.590 --> 04:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
because uh at least my hospital and I
 
04:59:37.628 --> 04:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
suspect every Hospital in New Hampshire
 
04:59:41.190 --> 04:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
has an orientation training program for
 
04:59:44.830 --> 04:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
every new employee and we also have
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
learning modules that we have to repeat
 
04:59:50.628 --> 04:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
every so often every year every two
 
04:59:54.750 --> 04:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
years Etc so this training can be
 
04:59:58.190 --> 04:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
integrated into the orientation training
 
05:00:02.190 --> 05:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
and learning modules at every hospitals
 
05:00:04.948 --> 05:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire to start with at
 
05:00:08.830 --> 05:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
least to Train everybody working for a
 
05:00:12.190 --> 05:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
hospital and then uh we may reassess the
 
05:00:14.948 --> 05:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
situation that is my Approach and
 
05:00:16.990 --> 05:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
another question that was asked was
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
about CME
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
situation every medical provider in New
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is mandated to complete 100
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
credit hours of uh training to obtain uh
 
05:00:34.750 --> 05:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
CMEs every every two years to renew
 
05:00:34.760 --> 05:00:35.628 align:start position:0%
CMEs every every two years to renew
their

05:00:35.628 --> 05:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
licenses and this training may be
 
05:00:42.910 --> 05:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
integrated into that
 
05:00:46.590 --> 05:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
mandate without our involvement at all
 
05:00:51.150 --> 05:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
and without adding extra burden on uh
 
05:00:54.510 --> 05:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
medical providers and as a result people
 
05:00:58.670 --> 05:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
may not only obtain CMEs to their lure
 
05:01:02.030 --> 05:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
but also get trained every two years and
 
05:01:05.708 --> 05:01:05.718 align:start position:0%
be updated with uh renewed information
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.830 --> 05:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
base doc uh representative Panic thank
 
05:01:17.470 --> 05:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you chairman um thank you for
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you're saying that
 
05:01:23.670 --> 05:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
every two years the Physicians and
 
05:01:27.030 --> 05:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
nurses who need to renew their
 
05:01:27.040 --> 05:01:28.510 align:start position:0%
nurses who need to renew their
Professional

05:01:28.510 --> 05:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
Professional
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
Licensing will have this mandated
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
program and would that be overseen by
 
05:01:39.628 --> 05:01:39.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:43.030 --> 05:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau um the Licensing Bureau is not
 
05:01:46.510 --> 05:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned in the bill um it
 
05:01:49.270 --> 05:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
is understood that it would be a
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
condition for
 
05:01:53.628 --> 05:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
employment so that when a person joins
 
05:01:56.110 --> 05:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
for example a hospital staff as Dr oral
 
05:01:58.990 --> 05:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
has explained part of their orientation
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
requirement would be to take this
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
training and that
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
recertification would be required every
 
05:02:05.600 --> 05:02:06.830 align:start position:0%
recertification would be required every
two

05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:02:09.430 --> 05:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
years okay I think I'm I'm a little
 
05:02:12.590 --> 05:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
confused no we have other people coming
 
05:02:14.510 --> 05:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
to testify I want to give them a chance
 
05:02:18.190 --> 05:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
let me explain but that training as part
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
of orientation and employment can be
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
used toward lure to make uh providers
 
05:02:26.240 --> 05:02:27.030 align:start position:0%
used toward lure to make uh providers
life

05:02:27.030 --> 05:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:02:29.350 --> 05:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
easier all right I'm going to thank
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
these people for testifying because we
 
05:02:33.990 --> 05:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
have some other folks who have some very
 
05:02:36.430 --> 05:02:36.440 align:start position:0%

05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%

05:04:12.670 --> 05:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
neglect very seriously hospitals require
 
05:04:14.910 --> 05:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
training in child abuse and neglect for
 
05:04:18.150 --> 05:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
all their staff upon hire and at least
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
annually New Hampshire Law requires any
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
person who any person not just providers
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
but any
 
05:04:28.030 --> 05:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
person who suspects that a child under
 
05:04:29.830 --> 05:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 has been abused or
 
05:04:34.030 --> 05:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
neglected must report that suspicion
 
05:04:35.788 --> 05:04:35.798 align:start position:0%
immediately to
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
DCF we agree that Healthcare Providers
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
are in a unique position to identify
 
05:04:41.788 --> 05:04:41.798 align:start position:0%
children who have been abused or
 
05:04:44.430 --> 05:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
neglected and support the programs that
 
05:04:46.150 --> 05:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
our members offer to help educate
 
05:04:48.910 --> 05:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
providers on reporting child abuse and
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
neglect um we do have a few questions
 
05:04:52.990 --> 05:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
for the committee's consideration on
 
05:04:55.510 --> 05:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and representative Nelson I
 
05:04:58.150 --> 05:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing those forward um
 
05:05:02.868 --> 05:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to the um
 
05:05:06.190 --> 05:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
line 15 uh of the bill where it states
 
05:05:08.548 --> 05:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
recognized and accredited training we
 
05:05:10.030 --> 05:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
just asked the committee to consider
 
05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
what constitutes this recognized and
 
05:05:13.628 --> 05:05:13.638 align:start position:0%
accredited training and what Authority
 
05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
determines the
 
05:05:17.070 --> 05:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications of that recognized and
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
accredited training Additionally the
 
05:05:22.910 --> 05:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
bill cites on line 13 all entities
 
05:05:25.030 --> 05:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
licensed Physicians advanced practice
 
05:05:27.230 --> 05:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
nurses or physician assistant provide
 
05:05:29.390 --> 05:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
the training uh we just asked the
 
05:05:31.310 --> 05:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
committee to question whether the this
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
captures all
 
05:05:35.910 --> 05:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
providers um that you have
 
05:05:38.670 --> 05:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
listed um or whether the employee
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
education mandate only applies to some
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
providers and not others depending on
 
05:05:44.070 --> 05:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
their work
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
Arrangements um again we are very
 
05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
supportive of ensuring our hospitals and
 
05:05:52.150 --> 05:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
providers um report on child neglect and
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
abuse um and thank you for the
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share our feedback on
 
05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
this important issue I'd be happy to
 
05:06:00.310 --> 05:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
take your questions U Mr Bradley going
 
05:06:02.708 --> 05:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
back to that point on line 13 all
 
05:06:06.190 --> 05:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
entities employing I'm one of those but
 
05:06:08.708 --> 05:06:08.718 align:start position:0%
I also know that there Standalone still
 
05:06:11.548 --> 05:06:11.558 align:start position:0%
in this day Standalone Family Practice
 
05:06:14.628 --> 05:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
Physicians and increasingly Standalone
 
05:06:17.548 --> 05:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners advanced practice
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
who are their own employer and are you
 
05:06:24.750 --> 05:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting that perhaps line 13 may be
 
05:06:27.150 --> 05:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
addressing those folks that we're not
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
capturing or we couldn't that's my
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman yes thank you good
 
05:06:35.670 --> 05:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:38.670 --> 05:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
rosan thank you thank you Mr
 
05:06:44.750 --> 05:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:49.868 --> 05:06:49.878 align:start position:0%
um we're ensuring that the hospitals are
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
reporting but what about the training so
 
05:06:56.190 --> 05:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
we all want to ensure that reporting is
 
05:06:58.830 --> 05:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
happening but what we've learned is that
 
05:07:00.590 --> 05:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
there isn't the proper training
 
05:07:02.868 --> 05:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
happening to identify
 
05:07:06.510 --> 05:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
and so what do you what's currently in
 
05:07:08.590 --> 05:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
practice right now that is providing
 
05:07:12.270 --> 05:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
training we all know that we're mandated
 
05:07:15.070 --> 05:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
reporters but currently right now what's
 
05:07:17.548 --> 05:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
in place well our as I mentioned in our
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
testimony our hospitals do require
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
training in in this child abuse and
 
05:07:26.708 --> 05:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
neglect um upon hire and annually um so
 
05:07:29.548 --> 05:07:29.558 align:start position:0%
I feel hospitals do cover that training
 
05:07:31.350 --> 05:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
um somebody and actually in the Preamble
 
05:07:35.190 --> 05:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
of the um bill it talks about voluntary
 
05:07:37.070 --> 05:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh training that's available publicly
 
05:07:39.910 --> 05:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
available for providers um but notes
 
05:07:43.868 --> 05:07:43.878 align:start position:0%
that few participate in it um that may
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
be because hospitals use their own
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to provide this training
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
versus what's the public uh volunteer
 
05:07:54.910 --> 05:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
training uh let me follow up on that by
 
05:07:57.390 --> 05:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
asking the question um this training and
 
05:07:59.070 --> 05:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
this training and there could be
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
training to be aware that such a thing
 
05:08:03.510 --> 05:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
as child abuse occurs there could be
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
more thorough training that shows uh
 
05:08:11.310 --> 05:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
what to look for um how do you respond
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
when you see a child continually be
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
readmitted that could be it's a
 
05:08:17.948 --> 05:08:17.958 align:start position:0%
9-year-old boy who likes to climb and
 
05:08:20.830 --> 05:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
fall out of or it could be Abus so to
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
what degree is the hospital uh training
 
05:08:28.470 --> 05:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
for new hires and annually how far do
 
05:08:30.990 --> 05:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
you go my understanding is that training
 
05:08:32.830 --> 05:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
is very comprehensive
 
05:08:35.788 --> 05:08:35.798 align:start position:0%
it provides for um not only recognizing
 
05:08:37.990 --> 05:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
but also how to report um but I'm happy
 
05:08:39.990 --> 05:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
to get you additional information I
 
05:08:42.350 --> 05:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
would from our from our members I'd love
 
05:08:45.548 --> 05:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
you to be able to show us what the
 
05:08:47.590 --> 05:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
training even if we could have an
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
outline of the trainer's script or
 
05:08:51.910 --> 05:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
something that would be wonderful if you
 
05:08:54.110 --> 05:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
could do that for us uh I'll see what I
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
can find thank you uh representative um
 
05:09:01.070 --> 05:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
question you've said that
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
hospitals provide the
 
05:09:13.470 --> 05:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
training my first part of my question
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
is is
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
it a a specific accredited training or
 
05:09:23.590 --> 05:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
is it a training that the
 
05:09:26.590 --> 05:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals bring together all by
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
themselves um I will look into it but my
 
05:09:31.470 --> 05:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it is um you know
 
05:09:32.948 --> 05:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
a a
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
um appropriate and accredited or or um
 
05:09:40.590 --> 05:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
recognized training for providers
 
05:09:43.510 --> 05:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
and yep go ahead thank you for that
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
answer just as a
 
05:09:46.240 --> 05:09:48.190 align:start position:0%
answer just as a
followup

05:09:48.190 --> 05:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:09:52.590 --> 05:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
um I know that in in order for an
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
employee uh and currently it uh
 
05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
according to this the training is
 
05:09:59.190 --> 05:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary but I know that for an
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
employee to um maintain employment with
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
any agency whether it be dealing with
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
children or not they have
 
05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
to fulfill a uh sex harassment course I
 
05:10:12.480 --> 05:10:13.590 align:start position:0%
to fulfill a uh sex harassment course I
find

05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
find
 
05:10:13.600 --> 05:10:15.788 align:start position:0%
find
it

05:10:15.788 --> 05:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
shocking that
 
05:10:22.470 --> 05:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
all entities who employ people who deal
 
05:10:24.590 --> 05:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
with children under the age of
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
18 don't have
 
05:10:32.830 --> 05:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
to be it isn't a demand that they
 
05:10:37.070 --> 05:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
file uh go through this training do you
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
feel that the hospitals will uh be more
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
consistent if this bill were to
 
05:10:44.948 --> 05:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
pass um I I think from what I understand
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
from our members and the information
 
05:10:48.708 --> 05:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
I've gathered they are consistent in
 
05:10:50.190 --> 05:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
requiring this training for their
 
05:10:52.868 --> 05:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
members or for their for their employees
 
05:10:56.310 --> 05:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
as I noted in my testimony upon hire and
 
05:10:59.350 --> 05:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
annually one final one final thank you
 
05:10:59.360 --> 05:11:00.948 align:start position:0%
annually one final one final thank you
Mr

05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
05:11:04.750 --> 05:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
chairman so they fairly consist is what
 
05:11:04.760 --> 05:11:05.548 align:start position:0%
chairman so they fairly consist is what
you

05:11:05.548 --> 05:11:05.558 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
said I'm I representative my
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is these our our members
 
05:11:17.350 --> 05:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
provide upon hire and
 
05:11:20.430 --> 05:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
annually training on child abuse and
 
05:11:24.548 --> 05:11:24.558 align:start position:0%
neglect all I'm asking is if there could
 
05:11:26.590 --> 05:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
be some consideration for clarity in the
 
05:11:26.600 --> 05:11:28.150 align:start position:0%
be some consideration for clarity in the
bill

05:11:28.150 --> 05:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:11:32.430 --> 05:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
on what constitutes accredited and
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
recognized for training uh maybe
 
05:11:36.788 --> 05:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
something worth the committee's
 
05:11:41.150 --> 05:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
consideration and um how the bill
 
05:11:43.190 --> 05:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
approaches Who falls under the
 
05:11:46.150 --> 05:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
requirements as it states all entities
 
05:11:49.150 --> 05:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
employing so with that you would be in
 
05:11:50.830 --> 05:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
support of this
 
05:11:54.430 --> 05:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
bill um I just need Clarity I I need
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
clar I think we can be we're very
 
05:11:58.510 --> 05:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
supportive of ensuring that there is
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
training for these providers on child NE
 
05:12:03.628 --> 05:12:03.638 align:start position:0%
neglect and
 
05:12:07.590 --> 05:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
abuse um and I think that some clarity
 
05:12:10.110 --> 05:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
around these questions would be helpful
 
05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
for our additional support on this Bill
 
05:12:12.480 --> 05:12:13.830 align:start position:0%
for our additional support on this Bill
thank

05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:12:17.350 --> 05:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
you I want to pick up on uh what I'm
 
05:12:21.548 --> 05:12:21.558 align:start position:0%
sensing is one of your points and if if
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
it isn't I'm going to round it out
 
05:12:26.948 --> 05:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
anyway um that I have seen
 
05:12:30.910 --> 05:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
training that was accredited by a
 
05:12:33.670 --> 05:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
recognized accreditation
 
05:12:38.548 --> 05:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
Bureau be less than a training program
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
that was not accredited for any number
 
05:12:44.110 --> 05:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
of legitimate reasons but it was far
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
superior so the question of accredited
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
and you know the the the buzz phrase we
 
05:12:53.070 --> 05:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
throw around now evidence-based which to
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
me is shorthand for don't answer
 
05:12:57.390 --> 05:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
anything else I've played Trump cards
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
now um I would like to know what your
 
05:13:03.270 --> 05:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
program is what it consists of I think
 
05:13:05.708 --> 05:13:05.718 align:start position:0%
it would be uh very helpful for me to
 
05:13:07.868 --> 05:13:07.878 align:start position:0%
know what our hospitals are doing in
 
05:13:09.830 --> 05:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
this and if you to provide that I'd
 
05:13:11.948 --> 05:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate it understood thank you
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%

for me as I rush to use the restroom
 
05:14:33.470 --> 05:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
coming from another uh meeting no excuse
 
05:14:36.230 --> 05:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you um I just want to
 
05:14:38.230 --> 05:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
start off by saying I I know this topic
 
05:14:41.548 --> 05:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
can be triggering and um if you please
 
05:14:42.830 --> 05:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
just take care of yourself if you need
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
to step out for a moment or you know
 
05:14:47.470 --> 05:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
take a break I think that we all do this
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
especially those of us who work in the
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
field um and so just as a reminder um
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
please take care of yourself um so as I
 
05:14:58.070 --> 05:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
told you my name is Dr Ru Gupta olal I'm
 
05:15:00.390 --> 05:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
a physician at Dartmouth Health in nsha
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
um I grew up in New Hampshire I hold a
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
medical license here and I am board
 
05:15:07.030 --> 05:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
certified in Family Medicine in addition
 
05:15:09.788 --> 05:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
to uh providing and delivering Primary
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
Care I've also worked in the fields of
 
05:15:14.350 --> 05:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
urgent care as well as substance use
 
05:15:16.590 --> 05:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
disorder over the last three years I've
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
been providing specialized Medical Care
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the and evaluations for children when
 
05:15:24.750 --> 05:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
there is a concern for abuse and neglect
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
therefore I work very closely with DCF
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
child advocacy centers law enforcement
 
05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
um the attorney uh you know the district
 
05:15:35.708 --> 05:15:35.718 align:start position:0%
attorney and county attorney's offices
 
05:15:38.430 --> 05:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
and um have been doing testimonies I'm
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
here to speak in support of House Bill
 
05:15:44.470 --> 05:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
1590 so I thought I would pivot a little
 
05:15:47.070 --> 05:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
bit from what I initially prepared to
 
05:15:50.030 --> 05:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
just um address a couple of U really
 
05:15:51.270 --> 05:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful questions that have come out
 
05:15:53.830 --> 05:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
of the discussion so far um many of
 
05:15:55.470 --> 05:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
which have been answered but
 
05:15:57.310 --> 05:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
particularly I know that Mr Bradley
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
brought up um you know a couple good
 
05:16:00.948 --> 05:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
points about what you know what is the
 
05:16:02.868 --> 05:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
accreditation and and you know the
 
05:16:05.470 --> 05:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals do provide um something and is
 
05:16:07.670 --> 05:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
it different from what it is being
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
spoken of so having been a Dartmouth
 
05:16:12.270 --> 05:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
employee which is in Dartmouth is as we
 
05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
know the largest employer in in New
 
05:16:16.230 --> 05:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also one of the bigger
 
05:16:18.868 --> 05:16:18.878 align:start position:0%
Hospital systems and works with um many
 
05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the other Hospital systems and I
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
closely work with Elliot and Southern
 
05:16:23.788 --> 05:16:23.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the other Hospital
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
Systems as well um so as an employee
 
05:16:29.548 --> 05:16:29.558 align:start position:0%
every year I do an annual attestation as
 
05:16:31.910 --> 05:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
well as um an annual training which I
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
believe is similar to what Mr badley was
 
05:16:38.030 --> 05:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
speaking of that consists of about six
 
05:16:41.670 --> 05:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
or seven modules ranging for topics of
 
05:16:41.680 --> 05:16:42.788 align:start position:0%
or seven modules ranging for topics of
cultural

05:16:42.788 --> 05:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
05:16:46.190 --> 05:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
competency um sexual harassment in the
 
05:16:49.230 --> 05:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
workplace uh interestingly hepatitis A B
 
05:16:53.230 --> 05:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
and C transmission um Dawning and doing
 
05:16:57.310 --> 05:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
of gloves and masks and then a couple
 
05:16:59.110 --> 05:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
other smaller items that usually get one
 
05:17:01.990 --> 05:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
to two slides one of which would be
 
05:17:04.230 --> 05:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
child abuse and being a mandatory
 
05:17:06.510 --> 05:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
reporter as we all know which is also
 
05:17:08.548 --> 05:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
the case for any adults in New Hampshire
 
05:17:11.230 --> 05:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
not just um Healthcare Providers and on
 
05:17:13.548 --> 05:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
that one or two slides um would also
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
include dcf's phone number and this is
 
05:17:18.150 --> 05:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
how you know and you should make your
 
05:17:20.548 --> 05:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
report what is not included in those
 
05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
couple slides in the training that I've
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
received annually as a Dartmouth
 
05:17:28.350 --> 05:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
employee um is what signs to look for
 
05:17:30.750 --> 05:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
what are inconsistent statements so if a
 
05:17:34.310 --> 05:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
a parent or a caregiver or a um you know
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
anyone bringing the child says oh yes
 
05:17:39.910 --> 05:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
this injury um happened because of you
 
05:17:41.350 --> 05:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
know the kids were playing with Nerf
 
05:17:44.110 --> 05:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
guns and d d d d da and a provider might
 
05:17:46.990 --> 05:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
say well that I guess I maybe that makes
 
05:17:48.628 --> 05:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
sense and sometimes it really does make
 
05:17:50.110 --> 05:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
sense and sometimes it does not make
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
sense so those types of nuances also you
 
05:17:56.590 --> 05:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
know a a baby who cannot yet walk or
 
05:17:59.030 --> 05:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
crawl should not have certain types of
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
injuries a toddler who is unctious and
 
05:18:04.230 --> 05:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
falling all over will likely have many
 
05:18:06.708 --> 05:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
bruises on their shins but they should
 
05:18:09.390 --> 05:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
not have bruises behind their ears they
 
05:18:12.030 --> 05:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
should not have marks on their neck um
 
05:18:13.990 --> 05:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
they may have bumps and little golf
 
05:18:16.190 --> 05:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
balls on their foreheads but there are
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
other places that would they will
 
05:18:20.070 --> 05:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
unlikely have those injuries and some of
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
these things you've heard the word
 
05:18:21.240 --> 05:18:22.670 align:start position:0%
these things you've heard the word
Sentinel

05:18:22.670 --> 05:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
Sentinel
 
05:18:25.510 --> 05:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
signs those are the types of things that
 
05:18:27.868 --> 05:18:27.878 align:start position:0%
can actually be delivered in content
 
05:18:29.868 --> 05:18:29.878 align:start position:0%
material within a few hours at least in
 
05:18:32.190 --> 05:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
an abbreviated way that can be very
 
05:18:35.470 --> 05:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
helpful for um providers of Health Care
 
05:18:38.628 --> 05:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
to then use as knowledge to then provide
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
the appropriate care whether or not a
 
05:18:43.390 --> 05:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
referral to dcyf should be made or is
 
05:18:44.788 --> 05:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
this something that we're going to say
 
05:18:46.750 --> 05:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
hey let's you know get an x-ray you know
 
05:18:49.230 --> 05:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
on our own and and see maybe you know
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
maybe it was this soccer injury whatnot
 
05:18:54.430 --> 05:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
um so I go off script a little bit just
 
05:18:56.910 --> 05:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
to address that because I believe that
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
and and and to also give you this
 
05:19:00.470 --> 05:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
background that there is a a three-hour
 
05:19:02.150 --> 05:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
module that was spoken of there's also a
 
05:19:06.030 --> 05:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
longer module that um many of uh the cap
 
05:19:07.990 --> 05:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
providers so cap is child advocacy and
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
protection program and we're a small
 
05:19:12.750 --> 05:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
group of nurse practitioners um
 
05:19:14.788 --> 05:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
Physicians social workers childlife
 
05:19:17.150 --> 05:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
Specialists nurses and we do the
 
05:19:19.070 --> 05:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
Specialized Care in New Hampshire for
 
05:19:21.110 --> 05:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
children when there's concern for abuse
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
so um several of us providers actually
 
05:19:26.190 --> 05:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
participate in giving this education
 
05:19:29.510 --> 05:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
live to Hospital Systems clinics and
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
whatnot when they voluntarily fault sign
 
05:19:34.470 --> 05:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
up for it we just see that not a lot of
 
05:19:36.510 --> 05:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
people are doing are signing up for it
 
05:19:38.230 --> 05:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
and I think that's why this bill is
 
05:19:40.230 --> 05:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
really important there are other
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
accredited courses that exist and
 
05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely those two hours um can be
 
05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
done in many different ways it is true
 
05:19:50.270 --> 05:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
though that there's this there's this
 
05:19:52.628 --> 05:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
one course that happens to be here in
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that would fit the bill
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
and give that knowledge um and is
 
05:19:59.788 --> 05:19:59.798 align:start position:0%
accredited by Dartmouth Health um so to
 
05:20:01.350 --> 05:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
go back and just share a little bit of I
 
05:20:03.628 --> 05:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
had planned um where it's relevant you
 
05:20:05.390 --> 05:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
know we do know that there's about a
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million children under the
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
age of 18 in New Hampshire and most of
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
them do see a a health care provider at
 
05:20:15.548 --> 05:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
some point whether it's for some sort of
 
05:20:18.270 --> 05:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
urgent reason or hopefully for well
 
05:20:20.510 --> 05:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
child checks which doesn't always happen
 
05:20:22.910 --> 05:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
but most kids are seen we know that most
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
kids are regularly seen by teachers and
 
05:20:27.470 --> 05:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
in school systems and so that is another
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
place that you know identification can
 
05:20:31.948 --> 05:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
happen however in a healthcare Cent
 
05:20:33.750 --> 05:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
doctors and skin being literally the
 
05:20:36.150 --> 05:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
largest organ in the body doctors are
 
05:20:39.628 --> 05:20:39.638 align:start position:0%
well equipped to make critical decisions
 
05:20:42.150 --> 05:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
um and with information that's presented
 
05:20:44.230 --> 05:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
in front of them to say hey yes this
 
05:20:46.150 --> 05:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
might be a concerning sign or this is
 
05:20:48.750 --> 05:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
not and so with that education and that
 
05:20:50.670 --> 05:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
background even as a refresher every
 
05:20:53.310 --> 05:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
couple years it's sort of ready and at
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
hand um I am you know I have a two
 
05:20:58.510 --> 05:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
children with chronic medical health
 
05:21:01.230 --> 05:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
issues I have aging parents I'm a
 
05:21:03.190 --> 05:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
patient myself and having been a
 
05:21:05.670 --> 05:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
physician for 20 years I can confirm
 
05:21:07.190 --> 05:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
what you already know that we don't have
 
05:21:09.390 --> 05:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of or Physicians don't often have
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of time to address issues that are
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
not sort of the presenting factor or the
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
main um topic of discussion for that
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
visit so if there is a finding that is
 
05:21:23.470 --> 05:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with why a child
 
05:21:26.830 --> 05:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
or an adult has come to a visit it it
 
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
can be hard um for that person to just
 
05:21:31.548 --> 05:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
sort of out of the blue pull up unless
 
05:21:33.548 --> 05:21:33.558 align:start position:0%
they've had sort of recent regular
 
05:21:36.750 --> 05:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
training on um you know physical exam
 
05:21:39.708 --> 05:21:39.718 align:start position:0%
findings or in congruent statements with
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
injuries that's those are the the
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities that they have if
 
05:21:44.910 --> 05:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
something's at the tip of their mind to
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
be like wait this might be something
 
05:21:48.270 --> 05:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
concerning and they don't need to make a
 
05:21:50.110 --> 05:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of child abuse they just need
 
05:21:52.910 --> 05:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
to refer to DCF who is then able to do a
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
thorough investigation and bring
 
05:21:57.230 --> 05:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
resources into the home I mean I think a
 
05:21:59.628 --> 05:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
lot of some of what the misconceptions
 
05:22:02.830 --> 05:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
are in in when in my conversations when
 
05:22:05.070 --> 05:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
I talk to other providers is that many
 
05:22:07.948 --> 05:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
people forget that DCF in our state has
 
05:22:10.990 --> 05:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful resources that when provided
 
05:22:13.868 --> 05:22:13.878 align:start position:0%
early for families can really make a
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
huge impact in how that parent guardian
 
05:22:20.150 --> 05:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
or whoever may take care of that child
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
and and have the their own abilities to
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
do that so that's sort of an opportunity
 
05:22:27.070 --> 05:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
that I think we we sort of forget that
 
05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
we have um I appreciate your time thank
 
05:22:30.750 --> 05:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
you very much and I'm open to any
 
05:22:32.390 --> 05:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
question questions that you may have
 
05:22:32.400 --> 05:22:33.548 align:start position:0%
question questions that you may have
thank

05:22:33.548 --> 05:22:33.558 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
you seeing none thank you Doctor seeing
 
05:22:38.788 --> 05:22:38.798 align:start position:0%
one thank you
 
05:22:41.070 --> 05:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you Mr
 
05:22:44.390 --> 05:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you thank you um my
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
question is rather broad um we um have
 
05:22:52.350 --> 05:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
um authorized Licensing Board in for
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
Physicians here in New Hampshire as uh
 
05:22:57.548 --> 05:22:57.558 align:start position:0%
well as we have a medical society and
 
05:22:59.310 --> 05:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just surprised that something like
 
05:23:01.150 --> 05:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
this needs to come before the legisl as
 
05:23:04.548 --> 05:23:04.558 align:start position:0%
opposed to being created within the
 
05:23:06.990 --> 05:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
system itself I mean that's what it's
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
for that's why we do licensing and so
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
that they can police themselves in a
 
05:23:14.230 --> 05:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
sense you know anything about that or
 
05:23:16.830 --> 05:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
has this come before the board or the
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
society so I think this is a wonderful
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
question I think one of the things that
 
05:23:22.628 --> 05:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
we see in medicine and this is true kind
 
05:23:25.150 --> 05:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
of back to the medical school question
 
05:23:27.070 --> 05:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
is that there are so many different
 
05:23:29.190 --> 05:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
areas and topics and there's very little
 
05:23:31.708 --> 05:23:31.718 align:start position:0%
sort of real estate and time for all the
 
05:23:33.708 --> 05:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
different things that could be covered
 
05:23:35.868 --> 05:23:35.878 align:start position:0%
um there are however a few things that
 
05:23:38.070 --> 05:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
touch you know no matter what specialty
 
05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
you're in so the currently out of say
 
05:23:43.868 --> 05:23:43.878 align:start position:0%
the hund the hundred um hours of
 
05:23:45.390 --> 05:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
continuing medical education every two
 
05:23:47.628 --> 05:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
years as a cycle for both physician
 
05:23:50.190 --> 05:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
assistants and and licensed Physicians
 
05:23:53.788 --> 05:23:53.798 align:start position:0%
three hours need to be on opioid use
 
05:23:56.510 --> 05:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
related matters and so that education
 
05:23:58.230 --> 05:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
those three credits or three hours need
 
05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
to be spec specific to that otherwi wise
 
05:24:04.990 --> 05:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
the other 97 hours can be generalized so
 
05:24:06.788 --> 05:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
as far as I know and I haven't been a
 
05:24:09.310 --> 05:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
part of so the short answerers I haven't
 
05:24:10.750 --> 05:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
been a part of those conversations what
 
05:24:12.628 --> 05:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
else can we make mandatory but what
 
05:24:15.070 --> 05:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
we're seeing is that there's a lack of
 
05:24:18.030 --> 05:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
education on child abuse even though it
 
05:24:20.990 --> 05:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
touches every field so anyone providing
 
05:24:24.190 --> 05:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
care under to a child under the age 18
 
05:24:26.590 --> 05:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
whether they're gastron neurologist or
 
05:24:28.708 --> 05:24:28.718 align:start position:0%
an asthma provider or a general
 
05:24:31.310 --> 05:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
pediatrician or an ed doc
 
05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
having that routine training and that
 
05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
exposure will allow for them to have
 
05:24:38.510 --> 05:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
that um sort of you know this is
 
05:24:40.190 --> 05:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
something that none of us want to see
 
05:24:44.070 --> 05:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
none of us want to find I mean you yeah
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
my point my point isn't whether we want
 
05:24:48.830 --> 05:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
this or not right of course we want
 
05:24:51.390 --> 05:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
consistency my point is why are you
 
05:24:53.788 --> 05:24:53.798 align:start position:0%
doing this through rules rather than
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
through your Society or through your um
 
05:24:59.750 --> 05:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh medical profession your Physicians
 
05:25:01.788 --> 05:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
board as opposed to com to the
 
05:25:03.910 --> 05:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and putting in a
 
05:25:06.070 --> 05:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
statute that's a fair question that I'll
 
05:25:08.110 --> 05:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
defer to those who have helped write
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
this bill um so I don't know that I can
 
05:25:13.110 --> 05:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
answer that directly thank you okay yeah
 
05:25:14.750 --> 05:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative it seems like
 
05:25:16.390 --> 05:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
we're caught between a rock and a hard
 
05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
place on the one hand we get yelled at
 
05:25:20.430 --> 05:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
when we tell the professions how to run
 
05:25:22.628 --> 05:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
their profession but on the other hand
 
05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
we've got professionals coming to us
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
saying tell us what to do yeah so the
 
05:25:29.868 --> 05:25:29.878 align:start position:0%
question I wonder is to what degree has
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
all this test testimony been given to
 
05:25:36.628 --> 05:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
oplc or Board of Medicine or the medical
 
05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
society saying hey we got a big problem
 
05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
we need to do this ourselves and why
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
does it wind up here am I on track with
 
05:25:49.350 --> 05:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
you there if I may may yeah yeah thank
 
05:25:51.990 --> 05:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
you I do think though um one thing to
 
05:25:53.510 --> 05:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
keep in mind where I can't answer that
 
05:25:55.868 --> 05:25:55.878 align:start position:0%
question directly I do know that several
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
other states do have similar legislation
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
in place um where they are um you know
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
having the mandatory training and at
 
05:26:06.510 --> 05:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
some point where you know this is the
 
05:26:09.270 --> 05:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
state that we are all a part of and you
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
know help to take care of um and live in
 
05:26:16.150 --> 05:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
there are you know we're seeing a a
 
05:26:18.868 --> 05:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
system failure of some sort and wherever
 
05:26:21.150 --> 05:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
and whatever it may be the the answer
 
05:26:24.230 --> 05:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
that may be right for the medical
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
societies across the state of the you
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
know the the nation of the United States
 
05:26:31.670 --> 05:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
may not still still be adequate enough
 
05:26:33.990 --> 05:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
for one state or another and in New
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we're seeing and and I
 
05:26:37.830 --> 05:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
don't I I don't want to make assumptions
 
05:26:40.030 --> 05:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
as to why it's in New Hampshire because
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's definitely there in other states
 
05:26:44.510 --> 05:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
but other states have also made progress
 
05:26:47.430 --> 05:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
to put in legislature to support such
 
05:26:49.110 --> 05:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory training so I don't think
 
05:26:52.190 --> 05:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
we're the only state to um be addressing
 
05:26:55.190 --> 05:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
it in this way um okay we're going to
 
05:26:57.310 --> 05:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
have to wrap this up thank you so much
 
05:27:00.190 --> 05:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I appreciate it I am
 
05:27:03.350 --> 05:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
one ing uh researcher if we could find
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
out what states have this by law as
 
05:27:08.868 --> 05:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
opposed to their Boards of medicine or
 
05:27:12.830 --> 05:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
oplc equivalents have done this so with
 
05:27:20.948 --> 05:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:25.910 --> 05:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:29.590 --> 05:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
one9 and also we would uh representative
 
05:27:32.350 --> 05:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
deimon would like to know if there is an
 
05:27:34.788 --> 05:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
accredited course that the American
 
05:27:37.190 --> 05:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
Medical Association and I would add the
 
05:27:40.070 --> 05:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
American osteopathic Association has in
 
05:27:42.310 --> 05:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
place on this subject that should be
 
05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
pretty quick to to do and thank you so
 
05:27:48.030 --> 05:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
much for doing this with that I conclude
 
05:27:51.310 --> 05:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
the hearing on Bill
 
05:27:54.510 --> 05:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
1590 and I don't think we want to
 
05:27:56.948 --> 05:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
proceed with this because I've heard
 
05:27:59.350 --> 05:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
there are some amendments floating
 
05:28:02.708 --> 05:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
around so we will defer an executive
 
05:28:06.070 --> 05:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
session is the 30th of the month if at
 
05:28:09.110 --> 05:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
all possible so thank you so much now

representing Hillsboro District 23 in
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh House Bill 1199 uh was
 
05:28:53.788 --> 05:28:53.798 align:start position:0%
brought to me early in the process um
 
05:28:57.708 --> 05:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
through my experience in Manchester I
 
05:29:01.390 --> 05:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
felt um often times
 
05:29:04.510 --> 05:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh including the state we concentrate on
 
05:29:04.520 --> 05:29:05.830 align:start position:0%
uh including the state we concentrate on
adult

05:29:05.830 --> 05:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
adult
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
homelessness uh because that's where we
 
05:29:12.350 --> 05:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
see mostly of um and and youth
 
05:29:16.430 --> 05:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
homelessness is is not really uh on top
 
05:29:20.750 --> 05:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the page um I could say for my years
 
05:29:22.670 --> 05:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
of uh being an alderman in
 
05:29:25.830 --> 05:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester I've I've heard every year
 
05:29:28.628 --> 05:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
the number of uh homeless youth in our
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
high schools uh that number in
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester is 6 to 900 and I'm always
 
05:29:35.230 --> 05:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
I'm always told double that because
 
05:29:36.750 --> 05:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
you're not getting a lot of them that
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
are uh that are going to qualif that are
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to tell you um and and uh I I
 
05:29:47.150 --> 05:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
don't see enough being done for youth uh
 
05:29:51.548 --> 05:29:51.558 align:start position:0%
I think in an effort to pick that up um
 
05:29:55.708 --> 05:29:55.718 align:start position:0%
that the state should have uh somebody
 
05:29:58.270 --> 05:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
who oversees that I like the fact that
 
05:30:01.590 --> 05:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's the uh child advocate uh
 
05:30:06.548 --> 05:30:06.558 align:start position:0%
independent uh from from the state uh or
 
05:30:10.510 --> 05:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
independent from uh any other entity um
 
05:30:12.310 --> 05:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
I like the reports I've gotten from the
 
05:30:15.788 --> 05:30:15.798 align:start position:0%
child La thus far not always uh
 
05:30:17.910 --> 05:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
reflecting nice on me but I want to hear
 
05:30:22.430 --> 05:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
the facts and not you know not what
 
05:30:24.350 --> 05:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
makes me feel good I want to hear what
 
05:30:28.070 --> 05:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
the truth is so I I I love the fact that
 
05:30:30.030 --> 05:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh if this committee approves it that it
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
would be going to the office of child
 
05:30:36.868 --> 05:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
advocate um and youth homelessness is a
 
05:30:41.230 --> 05:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
um something that I believe the state is
 
05:30:46.110 --> 05:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
addressing any questions for the prime
 
05:30:52.290 --> 05:30:52.300 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:30:53.830 --> 05:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Panic with a
 
05:31:00.350 --> 05:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman um thank you
 
05:31:03.868 --> 05:31:03.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm a little confused
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
on the cut off age um we're looking at
 
05:31:13.230 --> 05:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
in other bills uh you're of age of at
 
05:31:17.310 --> 05:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
age 18 in in special education you're of
 
05:31:22.150 --> 05:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
age uh at age 22 and in this case you're
 
05:31:25.830 --> 05:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
of age up until age 25
 
05:31:28.670 --> 05:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
so we seem to be all over the place with
 
05:31:31.150 --> 05:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
that I think that we've got a narrow it
 
05:31:35.030 --> 05:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
down to when are we considered adults at
 
05:31:38.948 --> 05:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
18 uh we can vote at 18 we can go serve
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
our country but according to this bill
 
05:31:45.270 --> 05:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
at age 25 we're still considered a
 
05:31:49.628 --> 05:31:49.638 align:start position:0%
youth um my also my concern with this
 
05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill is that um that's my only question
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
at this point in time thank you okay uh
 
05:31:59.390 --> 05:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
so the way I could respond to that is
 
05:32:01.548 --> 05:32:01.558 align:start position:0%
different scenario call for different
 
05:32:05.628 --> 05:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
expectations as far as age goes um you
 
05:32:09.070 --> 05:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
know I know a 24y old well a youth
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
experience in
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
homelessness under 18 uh has a high
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
likelihood of being homeless has has an
 
05:32:20.430 --> 05:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
adult if you want to identify an adult
 
05:32:24.510 --> 05:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
has 18 however somebody who's under
 
05:32:28.110 --> 05:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
25 um you know we all know that brain
 
05:32:31.270 --> 05:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
function um so I I think it would be
 
05:32:37.310 --> 05:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
beneficial to us um to address from my
 
05:32:40.708 --> 05:32:40.718 align:start position:0%
to address from 25 and under uh and not
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
go 18 and under um because at 26 and
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
over uh the states we still going to be
 
05:32:50.990 --> 05:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
paying our tax dollars to address that
 
05:32:54.030 --> 05:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
so I think it's easier in addressing it
 
05:32:56.590 --> 05:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
at a younger age than when they're more
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:05.110 --> 05:33:05.120 align:start position:0%

05:34:22.150 --> 05:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
understood to be the capacity of an
 
05:34:24.070 --> 05:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
individual to cope successfully with
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
significant changes in their lives
 
05:34:28.270 --> 05:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
protective factors include social
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
connectedness relig oity social support
 
05:34:34.990 --> 05:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
internal locus of control and positive
 
05:34:38.590 --> 05:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
emotionality the position that is um
 
05:34:40.350 --> 05:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
would be established if this bill was
 
05:34:42.628 --> 05:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
enacted um in the office of child
 
05:34:45.390 --> 05:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
advocate would be one that would look at
 
05:34:47.310 --> 05:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
all of these resources that are
 
05:34:49.510 --> 05:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
connected to these protective factors
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
factors for these uh young uh kiddos um
 
05:34:57.910 --> 05:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
so if this position was established then
 
05:34:59.830 --> 05:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
the youth who are experiencing home
 
05:35:01.990 --> 05:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
homelessness could be connected with
 
05:35:05.390 --> 05:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
social services that would then um
 
05:35:07.708 --> 05:35:07.718 align:start position:0%
potentially reduce their risk for
 
05:35:09.868 --> 05:35:09.878 align:start position:0%
suicide um and this is the reason that
 
05:35:11.548 --> 05:35:11.558 align:start position:0%
Nami no Hampshire is in support of this
 
05:35:12.990 --> 05:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
bill we do think that the office of
 
05:35:15.310 --> 05:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
child advocate is an appropriate place
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
for this uh position um
 
05:35:21.430 --> 05:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
because um they oversee existing
 
05:35:25.510 --> 05:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
programs and that support homeless youth
 
05:35:25.520 --> 05:35:27.230 align:start position:0%
programs and that support homeless youth
um

05:35:27.230 --> 05:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:30.510 --> 05:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
and would be able to look at all of the
 
05:35:33.070 --> 05:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh the gaps um and in the services that
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
are in existence today and with that I
 
05:35:38.070 --> 05:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
will end my testimony and take any
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:44.830 --> 05:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
have oh can I just mention one one last
 
05:35:47.948 --> 05:35:47.958 align:start position:0%
thing uh mention one last thing yeah um
 
05:35:50.990 --> 05:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
I know that the age was just asked about
 
05:35:55.350 --> 05:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
and um we know that youth ages 10 to 14
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
suicide is the leading cause of death in
 
05:35:59.910 --> 05:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um but uh we know that um
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
18 to 24 it's the second leading cause
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
of death and we know that brains um
 
05:36:08.310 --> 05:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
Contin continue to grow up until the age
 
05:36:10.990 --> 05:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
of 25 and I suspect that that is one of
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
the reasons that the uh sponsor chose
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
that as the cut off
 
05:36:17.390 --> 05:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
age good thank thank you thank
 
05:36:20.708 --> 05:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
you and would like to hear from um
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:28.680 --> 05:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
advocate

05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
05:36:33.670 --> 05:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon once again for the record
 
05:36:35.750 --> 05:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
Cassandra Sanchez the child advocate for
 
05:36:38.510 --> 05:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire um I too will
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
work to keep this brief for you um I
 
05:36:43.948 --> 05:36:43.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to share as many of you know um
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
the role of the office of the child
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
advocate our mandate is to oversee
 
05:36:50.670 --> 05:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
executive branch agencies that serve our
 
05:36:53.150 --> 05:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
children and in part in our mandate we
 
05:36:55.548 --> 05:36:55.558 align:start position:0%
are to assess those Services identify
 
05:36:58.708 --> 05:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
gaps and seek out um through advocacy
 
05:37:00.030 --> 05:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
additional legislation that can help
 
05:37:01.590 --> 05:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
fill those gaps and ensure the needs of
 
05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children are met um
 
05:37:06.990 --> 05:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
currently we are able to do that through
 
05:37:08.948 --> 05:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
um the children that are involved in our
 
05:37:12.510 --> 05:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
dcyf system um so we do work and um
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
oversee the missing children that are
 
05:37:16.310 --> 05:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
involved with DCF we do follow those
 
05:37:17.670 --> 05:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
missing children and ensure that they
 
05:37:20.708 --> 05:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
are recovered ensure that um the agency
 
05:37:23.110 --> 05:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
is looking out for signs of trafficking
 
05:37:25.110 --> 05:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
and other um high-risk behaviors in
 
05:37:27.030 --> 05:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
these children when they are missing and
 
05:37:29.830 --> 05:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we do have an aspect of this role um
 
05:37:31.110 --> 05:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
when talking about children who are
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
missing or are homeless already but
 
05:37:36.070 --> 05:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
again it is very specific to those
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
involved with our DCF system we know
 
05:37:39.548 --> 05:37:39.558 align:start position:0%
that we have many more children in the
 
05:37:40.670 --> 05:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire than those
 
05:37:42.590 --> 05:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
involved in our system that are facing
 
05:37:44.788 --> 05:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
homelessness or have gone missing at
 
05:37:47.150 --> 05:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
some point in their in their youth um
 
05:37:50.110 --> 05:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
childhood so given that um the expansion
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
and the added position in our office
 
05:37:53.750 --> 05:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
would allow us to further look at the
 
05:37:55.868 --> 05:37:55.878 align:start position:0%
homeless issue across the state we do
 
05:37:58.590 --> 05:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
have a Statewide lens in all that we do
 
05:38:00.350 --> 05:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
and so we are able to compare what areas
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
of the state have services that are
 
05:38:04.270 --> 05:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
working well and then look at how could
 
05:38:06.310 --> 05:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
we then expand those services to other
 
05:38:09.230 --> 05:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
areas of the state um another critical
 
05:38:11.708 --> 05:38:11.718 align:start position:0%
aspect of our office that allows for the
 
05:38:13.628 --> 05:38:13.638 align:start position:0%
great work that we do is our
 
05:38:15.830 --> 05:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
confidentiality we have the ability for
 
05:38:17.910 --> 05:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
those um who are either experiencing
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
homelessness or missing they can
 
05:38:21.470 --> 05:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
Outreach our office all communication
 
05:38:23.948 --> 05:38:23.958 align:start position:0%
with our office is confidential as well
 
05:38:26.548 --> 05:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
as those providing services to these
 
05:38:29.070 --> 05:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
communities a big piece of this and the
 
05:38:30.830 --> 05:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
importance of the confidentiality is
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
that that allows for folks to share
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
honest and transparent information with
 
05:38:37.670 --> 05:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
our office they're truly especially
 
05:38:39.390 --> 05:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
those that are providing the services
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
are able to share with us truthfully the
 
05:38:44.948 --> 05:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
gaps that they see that they're facing
 
05:38:47.468 --> 05:38:47.478 align:start position:0%
or that their agency um the barriers
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
that they have to truly providing the
 
05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
service that they want to provide in the
 
05:38:53.310 --> 05:38:53.320 align:start position:0%
community and this allows for us to get
 
05:38:55.910 --> 05:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
a a a different grasp on the issue than
 
05:38:58.030 --> 05:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
many of the other entities that are the
 
05:38:59.548 --> 05:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
ones that are directly providing the
 
05:39:03.150 --> 05:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
services or um have some some stake in
 
05:39:05.150 --> 05:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
the game um Beyond just providing a
 
05:39:06.750 --> 05:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
service and ensuring that those needs
 
05:39:09.868 --> 05:39:09.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:12.150 --> 05:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
community um and then also we do have
 
05:39:14.110 --> 05:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
access through our U memberships on
 
05:39:16.750 --> 05:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
multiple professional organizations to
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
um many others agencies like ours across
 
05:39:20.788 --> 05:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
the country and we tap into those
 
05:39:22.430 --> 05:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
professional organizations to look at
 
05:39:23.948 --> 05:39:23.958 align:start position:0%
advancements or what other states are
 
05:39:26.788 --> 05:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
doing um on these particular types of
 
05:39:28.948 --> 05:39:28.958 align:start position:0%
issues to see what we could bring into
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is Affordable and we
 
05:39:33.788 --> 05:39:33.798 align:start position:0%

05:41:34.230 --> 05:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
gained some knowledge of the number and

homelessness we better understand the
 
05:41:44.030 --> 05:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
true scope of the issue and some of the
 
05:41:46.990 --> 05:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
causes we also know that a number of
 
05:41:49.350 --> 05:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
young people aging out of child welfare
 
05:41:52.110 --> 05:41:52.120 align:start position:0%

experience homelessness in their young
 
05:41:59.510 --> 05:41:59.520 align:start position:0%

unstably housed throughout their early
 
05:42:08.548 --> 05:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
adulthood there has also been some work
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
done in New Hampshire to determine what
 
05:42:13.948 --> 05:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
a system of services to to prevent and

end Youth and Young Adult homelessness
 
05:42:18.990 --> 05:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
would look like and small pockets of
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
that system have begun to emerge but
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
even with this work we have not done
 
05:42:27.948 --> 05:42:27.958 align:start position:0%

would provide the 30,000 foot view that
 
05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire needs to make sure that we
 
05:43:56.910 --> 05:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
are examining the strengths and gaps of
 
05:43:59.948 --> 05:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
existing systems identify and bringing

together relevant stakeholders and
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
departments in ways that truly create

these vulnerable
 
05:44:12.750 --> 05:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
individuals this opportunity will also

with 75 staff but we cannot do this work
 
05:44:46.868 --> 05:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
alone the issue requires our state to
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
take a closer look and a greater level

our org for the last two years I have
 
05:46:06.750 --> 05:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
lived experience with homelessness as a
 
05:46:09.190 --> 05:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
22-year-old and I was a case manager at
 
05:46:10.990 --> 05:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
Waypoint with their runaway and homeless
 
05:46:13.750 --> 05:46:13.760 align:start position:0%

05:46:15.468 --> 05:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire youth success project
 
05:46:16.990 --> 05:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
is a board of young people who have
 
05:46:19.030 --> 05:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
experienced unaccompanied homelessness
 
05:46:20.868 --> 05:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire while under the age of
 
05:46:23.708 --> 05:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
25 and when I say unaccom that means we
 
05:46:25.590 --> 05:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
were without a parent or Guardian while
 
05:46:28.190 --> 05:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
we were experiencing homelessness um and
 
05:46:30.030 --> 05:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
the youed to success project Works to
 
05:46:31.868 --> 05:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
make sure that Youth and Young adults
 
05:46:35.110 --> 05:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
have a voice and a say in these issues
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
that impact us most directly and we
 
05:46:38.750 --> 05:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
believe that we both have a right to
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
have that say and that our systems are
 
05:46:43.548 --> 05:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
better and stronger when we are involved
 
05:46:46.830 --> 05:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
in decisionmaking that impacts us um we
 
05:46:48.628 --> 05:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
work closely with the Manchester and
 
05:46:50.708 --> 05:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
balance of state continuums of care
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
which work on ending homelessness across
 
05:46:55.350 --> 05:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
the state and have been involved in
 
05:46:57.270 --> 05:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
creating the coordinated Community plans
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
to end youth homelessness in New
 
05:47:01.868 --> 05:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and we were also very
 
05:47:04.230 --> 05:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
involved in the youth count survey
 
05:47:06.548 --> 05:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
creation um you are receiving info
 
05:47:08.230 --> 05:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
sheets right now with some of the main
 
05:47:11.190 --> 05:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
findings from that and it was also cited
 
05:47:15.430 --> 05:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself and while this survey
 
05:47:18.590 --> 05:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
was delivered to 18 to 24 year olds we
 
05:47:21.070 --> 05:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
asked the
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
1,476 respondents that we got responses
 
05:47:28.150 --> 05:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
from in October 2022 to reflect back on
 
05:47:30.830 --> 05:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
when they first experienced homelessness
 
05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
and that median age was 16 so we have a
 
05:47:36.150 --> 05:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
lot of young people who are experiencing
 
05:47:38.350 --> 05:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
unaccompanied homelessness without a
 
05:47:41.590 --> 05:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
parent or Guardian before they turn 18
 
05:47:43.310 --> 05:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
and often times they are not being
 
05:47:46.190 --> 05:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
connected to Services until they turn 18
 
05:47:47.990 --> 05:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of reasons why that might
 
05:47:51.070 --> 05:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
be but fear and lack of knowledge about
 
05:47:52.830 --> 05:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
what they're experiencing as
 
05:47:55.390 --> 05:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
homelessness is likely a big part of
 
05:47:58.430 --> 05:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
this um a little bit about Youth and
 
05:48:00.548 --> 05:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
Young adult homelessness we often
 
05:48:02.670 --> 05:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
describe it as invisible because young
 
05:48:04.910 --> 05:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
people again don't always know that what
 
05:48:07.750 --> 05:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing is homelessness and
 
05:48:09.548 --> 05:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
we're really good at flying under the
 
05:48:12.590 --> 05:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
radar we know how to shower and fit in
 
05:48:15.830 --> 05:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
with our peers and really fly under the
 
05:48:17.868 --> 05:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
radar if we're living in a car or
 
05:48:21.110 --> 05:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
staying with friends um which can make
 
05:48:23.110 --> 05:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
it really hard to see the effects of
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
Youth homelessness until it often
 
05:48:27.910 --> 05:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
evolves into adult homelessness or
 
05:48:30.468 --> 05:48:30.478 align:start position:0%
chronic homelessness is and this bill is
 
05:48:32.868 --> 05:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
really an opportunity to interrupt that
 
05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
early by providing with young people
 
05:48:38.390 --> 05:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
with supports um young people are also
 
05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
an especially vulnerable population of
 
05:48:43.430 --> 05:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
folks experiencing homelessness because
 
05:48:45.350 --> 05:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily have the survival
 
05:48:51.628 --> 05:48:51.638 align:start position:0%
skills to keep ourselves safe um we
 
05:48:55.070 --> 05:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
um we have a lck a lack of knowledge
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
about the systems or are just scared of
 
05:48:59.390 --> 05:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
involvement especially for young people
 
05:49:02.150 --> 05:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
under 18 and this can make us especially
 
05:49:03.788 --> 05:49:03.798 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to things like
 
05:49:07.150 --> 05:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
trafficking um it's also really hard to
 
05:49:09.350 --> 05:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
regain stability because we don't have
 
05:49:12.190 --> 05:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
rental history we often have poor or bad
 
05:49:16.150 --> 05:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
credit um and it can make it really
 
05:49:17.788 --> 05:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
challenging for us to compete in a
 
05:49:20.110 --> 05:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
rental market okay you're way over your
 
05:49:21.948 --> 05:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
three minutes requested so I'm going to
 
05:49:23.270 --> 05:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
ask give you a half a minute to
 
05:49:27.070 --> 05:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
summarize okay perfect um lastly this is
 
05:49:28.590 --> 05:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to prevent adult
 
05:49:30.270 --> 05:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
homelessness this is a critical age
 
05:49:33.548 --> 05:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
where we can turn things around and the
 
05:49:35.948 --> 05:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
you success project is excited to
 
05:49:37.510 --> 05:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
partner with the office of the child
 
05:49:39.230 --> 05:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
advocate we feel like this is a good
 
05:49:43.830 --> 05:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
place for this position to um live you
 
05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
have 11 more seconds I think that's all
 
05:49:49.070 --> 05:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
I have you're really kind are there any
 
05:49:51.628 --> 05:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Greg y
 
05:49:53.230 --> 05:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:49:55.150 --> 05:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
being here and taking the question and
 
05:49:57.548 --> 05:49:57.558 align:start position:0%
also for sharing your story so you did
 
05:50:00.070 --> 05:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
say that you were home correct M that's
 
05:50:02.150 --> 05:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
only half my question um what made the
 
05:50:05.468 --> 05:50:05.478 align:start position:0%
difference for you I was homeless for a
 
05:50:07.910 --> 05:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
brief period of time and what really
 
05:50:10.070 --> 05:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
made the difference for me was that my
 
05:50:12.708 --> 05:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
family's in Arizona and I had financial
 
05:50:14.310 --> 05:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
support which a lot of young people
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't I was able to get help getting a
 
05:50:19.590 --> 05:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
security deposit on an apartment and
 
05:50:21.548 --> 05:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
helping me get a car when I didn't have
 
05:50:24.350 --> 05:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
access to them if those two things have
 
05:50:25.670 --> 05:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
fell through I wouldn't have been able
 
05:50:28.468 --> 05:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
to keep my job and my homelessness would
 
05:50:32.510 --> 05:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
have lasted much longer but unlike many
 
05:50:35.788 --> 05:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
who have a genuine but theoretical
 
05:50:37.628 --> 05:50:37.638 align:start position:0%
compassion for the problem you've lived
 
05:50:42.830 --> 05:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
it correct yes yeah anyone
 
05:50:46.670 --> 05:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
else thank you so much thank you and the
 
05:50:52.030 --> 05:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.360 --> 05:51:01.868 align:start position:0%
 
hi

05:51:01.868 --> 05:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:04.230 --> 05:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you chairman and
 
05:51:05.548 --> 05:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for hearing my
 
05:51:07.628 --> 05:51:07.638 align:start position:0%
testimony today um my name is Emma
 
05:51:08.830 --> 05:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
savini I'm the children's Behavioral
 
05:51:10.430 --> 05:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
Health policy coordinator at new Futures
 
05:51:12.670 --> 05:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
new Futures is a nonprofit nonpartisan
 
05:51:14.468 --> 05:51:14.478 align:start position:0%
organization that Advocates educates and
 
05:51:15.788 --> 05:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
collaborates for the health and wellness
 
05:51:18.070 --> 05:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
of all Granite Staters um today we are
 
05:51:20.230 --> 05:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
here in strong support of House Bill
 
05:51:23.030 --> 05:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
1199 um for many of the reasons in fact
 
05:51:24.990 --> 05:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
all of the reasons you've already heard
 
05:51:28.948 --> 05:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to highlight uh the
 
05:51:31.190 --> 05:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
component that addresses youth mental
 
05:51:34.590 --> 05:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
health um when children experience
 
05:51:36.390 --> 05:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
homelessness or youth experience
 
05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
homelessness this is considered an ace
 
05:51:40.670 --> 05:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
or an adverse childhood experience um
 
05:51:42.510 --> 05:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences are
 
05:51:44.788 --> 05:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
traumatic events in childhood that can
 
05:51:46.510 --> 05:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
have really long and dangerous
 
05:51:49.310 --> 05:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
consequences long into adulthood um
 
05:51:51.590 --> 05:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
these can include mental illness chronic
 
05:51:54.868 --> 05:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
health problems um substance use among
 
05:51:56.708 --> 05:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
other really serious
 
05:51:58.830 --> 05:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
consequences um experience ing
 
05:52:00.910 --> 05:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
homelessness in youth is a risk factor
 
05:52:03.110 --> 05:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
to contribute that contributes to having
 
05:52:05.628 --> 05:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
higher Ace scores so when somebody
 
05:52:07.868 --> 05:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
experiences more than four aces in their
 
05:52:09.910 --> 05:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
life they're much more likely to have
 
05:52:12.270 --> 05:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
those severe consequences I just
 
05:52:16.350 --> 05:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
described um s uh concerningly youth
 
05:52:18.670 --> 05:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness um are more
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
likely to have caregivers who are
 
05:52:22.510 --> 05:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated have caregivers who are
 
05:52:25.070 --> 05:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing mental health issues or are
 
05:52:26.868 --> 05:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
experiencing substance use disorder all
 
05:52:28.990 --> 05:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
three of those are Aces
 
05:52:31.628 --> 05:52:31.638 align:start position:0%
um in addition when children are living
 
05:52:34.030 --> 05:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
in poverty including experiencing
 
05:52:37.350 --> 05:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
homelessness those um risk factors are
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
compounded and so they are more likely
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
than their peers who have um Financial
 
05:52:45.910 --> 05:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
Security to have Aces long term even
 
05:52:49.110 --> 05:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
with parents who are you know similarly
 
05:52:50.788 --> 05:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
experiencing mental health issues or
 
05:52:53.670 --> 05:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder or are
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
incarcerated um the good news though is
 
05:52:58.628 --> 05:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
that there are protective factors to
 
05:53:01.150 --> 05:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
that can reduce one's risk for those
 
05:53:04.190 --> 05:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
severe consequences down the line one of
 
05:53:06.990 --> 05:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
the most impactful ones is connecting uh
 
05:53:10.948 --> 05:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
youth with safe and sustainable housing
 
05:53:13.830 --> 05:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
um so House Bill 1199 is a great first
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
step in creating uh a system where our
 
05:53:19.990 --> 05:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
children can access safe and sustainable
 
05:53:24.310 --> 05:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
housing um through navigating systems um
 
05:53:27.230 --> 05:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
that they may be involved in um we also
 
05:53:29.468 --> 05:53:29.478 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that this position
 
05:53:31.390 --> 05:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
would be situated with the office of the
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
child advocate um I think it's important
 
05:53:36.510 --> 05:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
that the the position is able to nimbly
 
05:53:39.310 --> 05:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
navigate um both the criminal justice
 
05:53:41.110 --> 05:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
system the Health and Human Services
 
05:53:43.510 --> 05:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
System the education system um
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
homelessness touches so many aspects of
 
05:53:47.788 --> 05:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
life and I think this the office of
 
05:53:49.628 --> 05:53:49.638 align:start position:0%
child advocate is really well positioned
 
05:53:51.788 --> 05:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
to be able to access all of those and
 
05:53:53.548 --> 05:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
the other systems that a child may be
 
05:53:55.948 --> 05:53:55.958 align:start position:0%
experiencing as a result of their
 
05:53:59.310 --> 05:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
homelessness um so all of that is to say
 
05:54:01.230 --> 05:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
that new Futures would strongly urge the
 
05:54:02.708 --> 05:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
committee to vote a to pass and I'm
 
05:54:04.948 --> 05:54:04.958 align:start position:0%

05:54:08.990 --> 05:54:09.000 align:start position:0%

05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the person who is doing such a
 
05:57:24.070 --> 05:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous job as the clerk is slowly
 
05:57:28.628 --> 05:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
making her way to the witness
 
05:57:33.430 --> 05:57:33.440 align:start position:0%

05:57:36.468 --> 05:57:36.478 align:start position:0%

05:57:36.478 --> 05:57:37.990 align:start position:0%
um the chair now recognizes our very own
representative

05:57:37.990 --> 05:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:41.270 --> 05:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
all thank you
 
05:57:45.350 --> 05:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
your bill thank you chairman
 
05:57:48.510 --> 05:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
Pearson um this is a second go around we
 
05:57:52.750 --> 05:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
already um this is in a really bad
 
05:57:56.510 --> 05:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
spot we already um put this bill forward
 
05:57:59.468 --> 05:57:59.478 align:start position:0%
last year um unfortunately it did not
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
make it pass the Senate because of A
 
05:58:05.868 --> 05:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
Minor error and that was in one word
 
05:58:08.070 --> 05:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
actually it's two words I use the word
 
05:58:10.270 --> 05:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
benefit as opposed to the word child
 
05:58:14.030 --> 05:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
support on line seven if you recall the
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
reason this came before before us was
 
05:58:18.868 --> 05:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
because there was
 
05:58:23.948 --> 05:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
um some misunder understandings of when
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh child support ended it said that when
 
05:58:28.230 --> 05:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
the child completes High School
 
05:58:31.310 --> 05:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
or reaches the age of 18 whichever is
 
05:58:33.750 --> 05:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
later but in the scenario where a child
 
05:58:37.270 --> 05:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
turns 18 say in January but then drops
 
05:58:39.628 --> 05:58:39.638 align:start position:0%
out of school in April there is no end
 
05:58:43.510 --> 05:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
date because they've never graduated so
 
05:58:45.830 --> 05:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
that is what was brought to us by our
 
05:58:48.750 --> 05:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
constituents and so we um as a group
 
05:58:50.910 --> 05:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
came together we amended it so that we
 
05:58:53.510 --> 05:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
followed the Social Security wording as
 
05:58:56.990 --> 05:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
to when Social Security ended for um
 
05:58:59.150 --> 05:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
when children receive
 
05:59:01.510 --> 05:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
services and as I said because we took
 
05:59:03.948 --> 05:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
it right from Social Security we used I
 
05:59:05.190 --> 05:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
when we did this we used the words
 
05:59:07.350 --> 05:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
benefits and the Senate wants us to use
 
05:59:10.830 --> 05:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
the word child support on line seven I
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
did change in this presentation where we
 
05:59:17.070 --> 05:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
said last year on line 13 we would said
 
05:59:20.230 --> 05:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
we would go through age 22 to follow the
 
05:59:22.750 --> 05:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
um special education law I changed that
 
05:59:24.868 --> 05:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
wording because I sit on another
 
05:59:30.270 --> 05:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
Committee of um for children gosh it's
 
05:59:33.990 --> 05:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
been a long day and I'm totally brain
 
05:59:39.708 --> 05:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
dead um you you are among friends sorry
 
05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
05:59:42.240 --> 05:59:43.788 align:start position:0%
um it was
the

05:59:43.788 --> 05:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:59:47.590 --> 05:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
represented the child on children
 
05:59:51.030 --> 05:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah Child Care sorry the special
 
05:59:52.990 --> 05:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
committee on Child Care thank you very
 
05:59:55.510 --> 05:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
much yes and a representative I think it
 
05:59:57.788 --> 05:59:57.798 align:start position:0%
was representative MC Beth came up with
 
06:00:00.310 --> 06:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
this wording um she was concerned about
 
06:00:02.868 --> 06:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
putting a specific age of 21 because
 
06:00:04.910 --> 06:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the future that age would
 
06:00:07.310 --> 06:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
change and so rather than putting the
 
06:00:10.590 --> 06:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
specific word we would just link it to
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
um that RSA so that if that changed this
 
06:00:14.830 --> 06:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
would automatically change as well
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
should it say at some point go to age 23
 
06:00:19.910 --> 06:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
so that is the only um difference really
 
06:00:22.190 --> 06:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
are those two words child support and
 
06:00:25.350 --> 06:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
then changing how we determine um when
 
06:00:27.190 --> 06:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
it ends if a child in in special
 
06:00:27.200 --> 06:00:28.150 align:start position:0%
it ends if a child in in special
education

06:00:28.150 --> 06:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:00:30.510 --> 06:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
a those were the only two things I
 
06:00:31.990 --> 06:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
recall last year that this passed
 
06:00:33.628 --> 06:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
unanimously and I'm hoping that we can
 
06:00:35.910 --> 06:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
move it forward quickly uh once again
 
06:00:37.750 --> 06:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
this year since we were all in agreement
 
06:00:40.190 --> 06:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
last year thank you any questions for
 
06:00:40.200 --> 06:00:43.030 align:start position:0%
last year thank you any questions for
representative

06:00:43.030 --> 06:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:45.788 --> 06:00:45.798 align:start position:0%
ball well it was good last year and it's
 
06:00:48.310 --> 06:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
good this year too thank you so thank
 
06:00:50.948 --> 06:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
you so much well
 
06:00:54.468 --> 06:00:54.478 align:start position:0%
um we're going to go into a 4minute
 
06:00:57.510 --> 06:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
maximum here and if your speech is
 
06:00:59.548 --> 06:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
longer than that you get four minutes so
 
06:01:00.990 --> 06:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
you may want to cut out some things that
 
06:01:03.628 --> 06:01:03.638 align:start position:0%
are not helpful if you have a very long
 
06:01:06.030 --> 06:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
speech the chair recognizes Mr Robert
 
06:01:07.910 --> 06:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
tangu to come on up and you ask for
 
06:01:10.430 --> 06:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
three minutes and I'm giving you four
 
06:01:14.070 --> 06:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:18.270 --> 06:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um so uh I'll actually do
 
06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
less than that and hope that you'll grab
 
06:01:24.310 --> 06:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
me some cander in
 
06:01:24.320 --> 06:01:26.070 align:start position:0%
me some cander in
uh

06:01:26.070 --> 06:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:01:28.830 --> 06:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
1595 uh so so I I am in support of this
 
06:01:31.270 --> 06:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill uh it just clarifies the language
 
06:01:33.230 --> 06:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh I feel like the language in the
 
06:01:36.868 --> 06:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
original bill is or law is uh
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
restrictive saying that it ends when
 
06:01:44.030 --> 06:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
they turn 18 and it this way gives it uh
 
06:01:50.628 --> 06:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
more more more room um uh to do so and
 
06:01:52.030 --> 06:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't really seem like it will
 
06:01:54.310 --> 06:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
have much of effect but it it will it
 
06:01:55.708 --> 06:01:55.718 align:start position:0%
just it
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
just child support in my opinion um is
 
06:02:02.548 --> 06:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
something that's kind of used as a tool
 
06:02:04.310 --> 06:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
and it's uh brings a lot of funding to
 
06:02:08.350 --> 06:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
the state and that's good uh for
 
06:02:11.590 --> 06:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers but the the money that comes
 
06:02:14.390 --> 06:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the state from title for uh D is
 
06:02:16.510 --> 06:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
coming from federal tax funds so it's
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
still taxpayers and uh I think that
 
06:02:23.708 --> 06:02:23.718 align:start position:0%
child support causes contention whereas
 
06:02:26.030 --> 06:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
each individual parent should be able to
 
06:02:27.868 --> 06:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
choose how they spend their their money
 
06:02:32.110 --> 06:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
on their uh children and family and uh
 
06:02:35.150 --> 06:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
with that I I'll end it my coms thank
 
06:02:38.350 --> 06:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
you so much wow you got two minutes and
 
06:02:42.830 --> 06:02:42.840 align:start position:0%

06:02:58.548 --> 06:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
punchy thank you Mr
 
06:02:58.558 --> 06:03:00.110 align:start position:0%
punchy thank you Mr
chairman

06:03:00.110 --> 06:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:03:04.948 --> 06:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
um as a representative of DHHS bcss uh
 
06:03:06.430 --> 06:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
the only two things I would like to
 
06:03:10.390 --> 06:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
point out about this bill is that it um
 
06:03:12.990 --> 06:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
calls to go into effect in 60 days and
 
06:03:15.948 --> 06:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
as child support we would have to do
 
06:03:18.788 --> 06:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
some there will be some training there
 
06:03:20.110 --> 06:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
will be
 
06:03:23.990 --> 06:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
some um you know computer type stuff I'm
 
06:03:25.310 --> 06:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
just the lawyer of computer stuff I'm
 
06:03:27.990 --> 06:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
like I don't know you know but
 
06:03:30.468 --> 06:03:30.478 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm assuming the court will also
 
06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
have things that they'll need to do
 
06:03:34.270 --> 06:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
because suddenly it'll be it'll be
 
06:03:37.510 --> 06:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
different so I think 60 days seems like
 
06:03:39.590 --> 06:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
a short amount of time especially since
 
06:03:41.030 --> 06:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're coming up on what they call
 
06:03:41.040 --> 06:03:42.390 align:start position:0%
we're coming up on what they call
graduation

06:03:42.390 --> 06:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
06:03:46.150 --> 06:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
season where the issues of 1819 who's in
 
06:03:49.830 --> 06:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
high school become a thing to that point
 
06:03:53.150 --> 06:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be uh appropriate to say it
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
is not 60 days from now but 60 days from
 
06:03:59.910 --> 06:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
passage and if the house passes it and
 
06:04:03.270 --> 06:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
the Senate passes it send the Spy over
 
06:04:05.628 --> 06:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
to the governor's office and ask him if
 
06:04:07.830 --> 06:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
he's going to sign it and if the word is
 
06:04:09.948 --> 06:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
yes you can start the training and and
 
06:04:12.310 --> 06:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
tell him to go slow with the pen and I
 
06:04:14.910 --> 06:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
mean there's ways to do
 
06:04:17.830 --> 06:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
this I have no official position on that
 
06:04:21.390 --> 06:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking you for an official
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
position I would also point out that
 
06:04:25.868 --> 06:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
there's no there is not an appropriation
 
06:04:29.310 --> 06:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
for the changes made in this yeah well
 
06:04:31.628 --> 06:04:31.638 align:start position:0%
other than that well I want to give you

conquered New Hampshire uh with about 25
 
06:06:08.150 --> 06:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
experience 25 years experience
 
06:06:10.628 --> 06:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
practicing in high concentration in
 
06:06:13.070 --> 06:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
family law uh read the bill familiar
 
06:06:15.350 --> 06:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
with child support guidelines generally
 
06:06:17.910 --> 06:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
supportive only a couple of questions
 
06:06:19.868 --> 06:06:19.878 align:start position:0%
that the committee might want to think
 
06:06:24.070 --> 06:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
about um one is uh was the legislative
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
intent to include homeschooled children
 
06:06:28.590 --> 06:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
in this as well as well and the reason I
 
06:06:32.150 --> 06:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
ask is because um the languages is still
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
a full-time student at a secondary or
 
06:06:36.830 --> 06:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
Elementary School at the age of
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
18 um if you my I respectfully point out
 
06:06:44.430 --> 06:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
that there might be a question of law as
 
06:06:46.110 --> 06:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
to whether this applies to children who
 
06:06:47.948 --> 06:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
were homeschooled because they're not
 
06:06:50.350 --> 06:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
really enrolled in school uh what
 
06:06:52.510 --> 06:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
they're usually doing is they are part
 
06:06:55.070 --> 06:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
of a if they're homeschooled they're
 
06:06:57.468 --> 06:06:57.478 align:start position:0%
usually a part of a department of V tion
 
06:07:00.390 --> 06:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
approved homeschooling plan uh so you
 
06:07:02.670 --> 06:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
may just respectfully pointing out I
 
06:07:04.788 --> 06:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
hope it passes but I would not want to
 
06:07:06.948 --> 06:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
see any ambiguities in it and create
 
06:07:09.390 --> 06:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
additional legal problems so I'm just
 
06:07:11.030 --> 06:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
thinking you might want to have language
 
06:07:13.910 --> 06:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
in there that is enrolled as a full-time
 
06:07:16.390 --> 06:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
student um at a secondary or elementary
 
06:07:19.270 --> 06:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
school or in uh New Hampshire Department
 
06:07:21.230 --> 06:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
of Education approved homeschooling
 
06:07:23.110 --> 06:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
program which would provide the same
 
06:07:23.120 --> 06:07:24.190 align:start position:0%
program which would provide the same
congruent

06:07:24.190 --> 06:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
congruent
 
06:07:26.670 --> 06:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
protections um the those would be the
 
06:07:28.628 --> 06:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
only only things the only thing I would
 
06:07:30.548 --> 06:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
think of would be whether or not you
 
06:07:32.628 --> 06:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
intend to apply this
 
06:07:35.150 --> 06:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
prospectively uh or
 
06:07:38.230 --> 06:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
retroactively uh So to avoid problems
 
06:07:40.350 --> 06:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
with modifications I don't think there
 
06:07:42.150 --> 06:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
would be a flood of it because by the
 
06:07:44.750 --> 06:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
time if this comes comes to pass there
 
06:07:46.868 --> 06:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
may be a small Gap you may see you may
 
06:07:49.310 --> 06:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
see additional filings so you may want
 
06:07:51.430 --> 06:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
to think about that and debate it
 
06:07:53.788 --> 06:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
amongst yourselves otherwise I can see
 
06:07:55.868 --> 06:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
the need for brevity and I'm done if
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
anybody has any question questions be
 
06:08:03.468 --> 06:08:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:06.510 --> 06:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
them seeing none but thank you for that
 
06:08:08.070 --> 06:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
um they're trying to make me a lawyer
 
06:08:10.110 --> 06:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
you know they're buying me law books and
 
06:08:12.150 --> 06:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
putting me on legal committees and so on
 
06:08:15.628 --> 06:08:15.638 align:start position:0%
and I just love the legal ability to
 
06:08:18.708 --> 06:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
look at something and see we liberal
 
06:08:20.670 --> 06:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
arts people will just say wow that's so
 
06:08:23.110 --> 06:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
cool you know and a lawyer mind will
 
06:08:25.948 --> 06:08:25.958 align:start position:0%
look at potential problems in its
 
06:08:27.830 --> 06:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
specific so thank thank you so much for
 
06:08:29.070 --> 06:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
bringing these pleas thank you for the
 
06:08:32.270 --> 06:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address you I appreciate
 
06:08:34.788 --> 06:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
it I have no more cards so this
 
06:08:37.750 --> 06:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
concludes the hearing on 1282 FN and I'm
 
06:08:39.628 --> 06:08:39.638 align:start position:0%
going to ask what do you think do you
 
06:08:43.948 --> 06:08:43.958 align:start position:0%
think we want to uh ask a couple of our
 
06:08:47.150 --> 06:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
members to come up with and I heard oo
 
06:08:49.990 --> 06:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
and AZ from
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
this I'm looking at you but I mean from
 
06:08:55.708 --> 06:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
you you can be part of that if you were
 
06:08:57.310 --> 06:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
quiet okay that's fine
 
06:09:01.070 --> 06:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:05.990 --> 06:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
and you are um the prime sponsor if we
 
06:09:07.350 --> 06:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
all think this well even if we don't
 
06:09:08.830 --> 06:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea you have the
 
06:09:11.868 --> 06:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
right to get an amendment you may want
 
06:09:14.910 --> 06:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
to talk to O and
 
06:09:16.868 --> 06:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
ah and
 
06:09:20.070 --> 06:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
quiet and see what they think and bring
 
06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
it back and on uh you know if you bring
 
06:09:24.548 --> 06:09:24.558 align:start position:0%
it back in a week or two we can do it in
 
06:09:26.590 --> 06:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
a week or two it's not it's just let me
 
06:09:30.868 --> 06:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
know no so uh we can uh notice it okay
 
06:09:36.590 --> 06:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:39.070 --> 06:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
one yeah go ahead so that that amendment
 
06:09:41.510 --> 06:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
is just to the
 
06:09:41.520 --> 06:09:47.788 align:start position:0%
is just to the
uh

06:09:47.788 --> 06:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:50.590 --> 06:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh just to the effective date
 
06:09:52.110 --> 06:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
representative Paul no there's two
 
06:09:54.310 --> 06:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
things homeschools oh and home schools
 
06:09:55.990 --> 06:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay is that what you want to work on
 
06:09:57.948 --> 06:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
both of those things
 
06:09:59.430 --> 06:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
The Homeschool one's easier to
 
06:10:01.830 --> 06:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
understand the prospective retrospective
 
06:10:04.510 --> 06:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
we may want to ask Council to elaborate
 
06:10:06.510 --> 06:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
yes please yes chairman would you
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
elaborate please if you're calling me
 
06:10:12.270 --> 06:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
back I am okay uh the prospective versus
 
06:10:15.270 --> 06:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
retrospective um The Homeschool thing
 
06:10:16.468 --> 06:10:16.478 align:start position:0%
thank you we're going to work on that
 
06:10:18.150 --> 06:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
but the the second one we may need a
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
little unpacking of that oh okay okay so
 
06:10:23.110 --> 06:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
in other words generally speaking unless
 
06:10:25.548 --> 06:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
something is Curative okay it it applies
 
06:10:27.270 --> 06:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
prospectively rather than than
 
06:10:30.830 --> 06:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
retroactively so for example uh and you
 
06:10:33.548 --> 06:10:33.558 align:start position:0%
usually see that in in in in the terms
 
06:10:36.670 --> 06:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
of uh statutes which have to be amended
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
because of their constitutional
 
06:10:41.230 --> 06:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
deformities and so for example sometimes
 
06:10:43.948 --> 06:10:43.958 align:start position:0%
they apply things retroactively so it
 
06:10:46.868 --> 06:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
might be worthwhile to State whether
 
06:10:49.590 --> 06:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
this whether this statute itself
 
06:10:52.390 --> 06:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
constitutes a basis for a modification
 
06:10:56.110 --> 06:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
or not of a uh of present child support
 
06:10:58.270 --> 06:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
of present child support
 
06:11:01.030 --> 06:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
orders uh because I can see somebody
 
06:11:03.868 --> 06:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
seeing this passing and somebody saying
 
06:11:07.590 --> 06:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
well you know either uh he's 18 he's
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
going to be 19 it's going to be this or
 
06:11:11.510 --> 06:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
that or you're going to apply it and you
 
06:11:12.910 --> 06:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
know you can say well shall not
 
06:11:15.310 --> 06:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
constitute a basis for a modification
 
06:11:18.510 --> 06:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
and applies uh to new orders only words
 
06:11:20.708 --> 06:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
to that
 
06:11:24.070 --> 06:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
effect that it
 
06:11:34.150 --> 06:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:36.468 --> 06:11:36.478 align:start position:0%
pleasure I'm sorry yeah go ahead
 
06:11:37.788 --> 06:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
06:11:40.590 --> 06:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm sorry I was just that then
 
06:11:42.750 --> 06:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
leads me to the question uh if we if we
 
06:11:44.670 --> 06:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
were to have an amendment that said that
 
06:11:46.510 --> 06:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
this C you know shall not apply to
 
06:11:48.510 --> 06:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
modifications does that mean that anyone
 
06:11:51.548 --> 06:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
who has a current child support order
 
06:11:53.230 --> 06:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to then go back to
 
06:11:55.310 --> 06:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
court once it was enacted I'm sorry
 
06:11:58.230 --> 06:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
could you please repeat that so
 
06:12:00.590 --> 06:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
if if we were to say that it doesn't
 
06:12:01.548 --> 06:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
modifications does that mean that anyone
 
06:12:06.190 --> 06:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
who currently has a child support order
 
06:12:08.708 --> 06:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
would not be able to go back to court
 
06:12:11.390 --> 06:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
and have that modified no what it would
 
06:12:13.990 --> 06:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
mean it would be basically in other
 
06:12:15.468 --> 06:12:15.478 align:start position:0%
words if you're going to say in other
 
06:12:17.430 --> 06:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
words you really don't want to turn this
 
06:12:19.670 --> 06:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think it will happen but you
 
06:12:21.750 --> 06:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't really want to turn it into what
 
06:12:23.788 --> 06:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
amounts to I'll call
 
06:12:26.590 --> 06:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
Floodgate you just don't want a flood of
 
06:12:28.590 --> 06:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
people coming to court and saying I want
 
06:12:30.430 --> 06:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
to change and and because we have
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably 60 or 70% of the people who go
 
06:12:35.390 --> 06:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
to court are are self represented and
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
they may not have the same knowledge
 
06:12:39.548 --> 06:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
okay they'll look at a statute and go oh
 
06:12:41.548 --> 06:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
that applies whatever and you just don't
 
06:12:43.788 --> 06:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
want to flood courts with uh
 
06:12:46.350 --> 06:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
modifications that really aren't timely
 
06:12:48.230 --> 06:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh most of the judges are overworked as
 
06:12:49.990 --> 06:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:12:52.830 --> 06:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
right so in other words you know in and
 
06:12:54.868 --> 06:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
of itself shall not be a basis for a
 
06:12:57.070 --> 06:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
modification it should apply to new
 
06:13:00.548 --> 06:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
orders okay if somebody is going to come
 
06:13:02.910 --> 06:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
forward and you know they're in a
 
06:13:05.548 --> 06:13:05.558 align:start position:0%
position where they either have to renew
 
06:13:07.830 --> 06:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
an order for a very short period of time
 
06:13:10.390 --> 06:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's possible you know I Can See For
 
06:13:13.990 --> 06:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
example where somebody might say
 
06:13:17.230 --> 06:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
um oh
 
06:13:20.708 --> 06:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
they're in high school but uh they're
 
06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
not going to graduate for a while or
 
06:13:24.350 --> 06:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
something like that and I need to extend
 
06:13:27.070 --> 06:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
the order that's certainly one thing
 
06:13:29.030 --> 06:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing that I and I hope
 
06:13:30.750 --> 06:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
I've answered that question just to
 
06:13:33.070 --> 06:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
carry it one step further I have had
 
06:13:36.510 --> 06:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
cases where and where this statute does
 
06:13:39.628 --> 06:13:39.638 align:start position:0%
well to to cure the whole where I've had
 
06:13:43.190 --> 06:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
19yearold high school seniors okay so
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
that order still applies because they
 
06:13:47.190 --> 06:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
hadn't graduated high school so they
 
06:13:49.468 --> 06:13:49.478 align:start position:0%
were so on that basis the last
 
06:13:52.670 --> 06:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
occurrence of now you have 20 year olds
 
06:13:54.868 --> 06:13:54.878 align:start position:0%
and 21 year olds believe it or not in
 
06:13:57.030 --> 06:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
high school and the a child support
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
order in
 
06:14:01.070 --> 06:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
effect so this is what that cures and I
 
06:14:03.110 --> 06:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
think it's probably a good idea to do it
 
06:14:05.628 --> 06:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
that way also Maine has something
 
06:14:08.270 --> 06:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
similar to it uh where child support
 
06:14:10.628 --> 06:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
will end at 19 the idea being you you've
 
06:14:12.910 --> 06:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
had enough time to to finish school here
 
06:14:14.468 --> 06:14:14.478 align:start position:0%
and that's really kind of
 
06:14:16.910 --> 06:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
06:14:20.430 --> 06:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
you representative thank attorney marel
 
06:14:23.190 --> 06:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
could you return to the bench oh sure
 
06:14:26.830 --> 06:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
okay don't leave yes oh okay uh just uh
 
06:14:29.310 --> 06:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
two questions for your guidance sir um
 
06:14:31.750 --> 06:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
if you're and this this one of a
 
06:14:35.468 --> 06:14:35.478 align:start position:0%
speculation uh address if an individual
 
06:14:38.350 --> 06:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
is uh already graduated like up to 25
 
06:14:39.910 --> 06:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
years old right would there be a
 
06:14:43.230 --> 06:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
retroactive Bill to be paid um only in
 
06:14:45.948 --> 06:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
terms of existing orders so for example
 
06:14:49.230 --> 06:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't create a new obligation but
 
06:14:54.830 --> 06:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh if for example somebody's 25 25 would
 
06:14:56.868 --> 06:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
be kind of long out there
 
06:14:58.750 --> 06:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
but if there was an unpaid child support
 
06:15:01.110 --> 06:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
obligation it's still unpaid uh
 
06:15:02.948 --> 06:15:02.958 align:start position:0%
basically if you look at a uniform
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
support order as they are now you'll see
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
that each order for payment actually
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
becomes an independent judgment as it's
 
06:15:10.708 --> 06:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
due so you don't have to keep going back
 
06:15:14.190 --> 06:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
to court all the time and then just for
 
06:15:16.830 --> 06:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
point a CL followup thank Mr chairman uh
 
06:15:20.070 --> 06:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
attorney Marcel uh that individual never
 
06:15:22.070 --> 06:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
graduated well if he's that's the
 
06:15:23.750 --> 06:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
problem with the current statute I think
 
06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
that's what this is is meant to fix okay
 
06:15:30.670 --> 06:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
so uh and that's the whole in the law
 
06:15:34.270 --> 06:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
that this fixes this says that uh child
 
06:15:36.830 --> 06:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
support will absolutely terminate by the
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
age of 19 years and two months no matter
 
06:15:42.230 --> 06:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
what unless the parties agree to
 
06:15:45.230 --> 06:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
lengthen it which they are free to do
 
06:15:47.750 --> 06:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay and then one last one Mr chairman
 
06:15:49.590 --> 06:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
um attorney Marcel you referred to one
 
06:15:51.708 --> 06:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
other uh statement I was trying to check
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
my note real quick sure to be added uh
 
06:15:57.150 --> 06:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere in somewhere in here and I
 
06:15:59.548 --> 06:15:59.558 align:start position:0%
just if you would just restate that as
 
06:16:02.270 --> 06:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
as to where would that narrative change
 
06:16:04.750 --> 06:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay be placed and like the wording like
 
06:16:06.670 --> 06:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
in what line would that where would that
 
06:16:09.510 --> 06:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
go okay well I'm presuming you are
 
06:16:11.548 --> 06:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:16:15.590 --> 06:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
um let me get it out here okay so we're
 
06:16:18.788 --> 06:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
talking about the approved um about the
 
06:16:18.798 --> 06:16:19.750 align:start position:0%
talking about the approved um about the
approved

06:16:19.750 --> 06:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
approved
 
06:16:22.270 --> 06:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
schooling uh if you're talking about
 
06:16:26.670 --> 06:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
that I would say that um if you look at
 
06:16:29.468 --> 06:16:29.478 align:start position:0%
line okay starting from the Roman
 
06:16:29.478 --> 06:16:30.548 align:start position:0%
line okay starting from the Roman
numeral

06:16:30.548 --> 06:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
06:16:35.548 --> 06:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
4 okay 1 2 3 4 and then where where it
 
06:16:39.310 --> 06:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
starts on the left RSA 461b and then you
 
06:16:42.030 --> 06:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
have the Bold or reaches the age of 18
 
06:16:45.548 --> 06:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
years old unless the child is still a
 
06:16:48.310 --> 06:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
full-time student at a secondary or
 
06:16:50.910 --> 06:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
Elementary School at the age of 18
 
06:16:52.910 --> 06:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
parenthetically I'm not sure where
 
06:16:55.390 --> 06:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
Elementary School would be in there but
 
06:16:59.070 --> 06:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
assuming it apply somehow and it might
 
06:17:03.948 --> 06:17:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh or and then what I would write is um
 
06:17:07.990 --> 06:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
enrolled in an approve in a new in a let
 
06:17:09.430 --> 06:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
me just give you some
 
06:17:11.590 --> 06:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
languag An
 
06:17:11.600 --> 06:17:14.350 align:start position:0%
languag An
approved

06:17:14.350 --> 06:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
approved
 
06:17:18.750 --> 06:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh a homeschooling program approved by
 
06:17:21.708 --> 06:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
06:17:24.750 --> 06:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
Education and that would be my
 
06:17:28.190 --> 06:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment but that that incl okay we got
 
06:17:31.468 --> 06:17:31.478 align:start position:0%
I got that um would the charter schools
 
06:17:31.478 --> 06:17:32.230 align:start position:0%
I got that um would the charter schools
come

06:17:32.230 --> 06:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
come
 
06:17:34.230 --> 06:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
under if it's approved by the New
 
06:17:35.868 --> 06:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education if
 
06:17:37.868 --> 06:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
they're approved if they're approved but
 
06:17:40.628 --> 06:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
would that Comm under uh when I say
 
06:17:42.390 --> 06:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
command it's it's there's different
 
06:17:45.628 --> 06:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
designations now okay on location so so
 
06:17:46.708 --> 06:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be in terms you know
 
06:17:49.628 --> 06:17:49.638 align:start position:0%
Elementary you know High uh secondary
 
06:17:51.990 --> 06:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
right but charter schools are Standalone
 
06:17:53.948 --> 06:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
okay uh and want to see what your
 
06:17:56.030 --> 06:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
guidance would be in that regard okay if
 
06:17:57.868 --> 06:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
if a charter school is basically I'm
 
06:17:59.468 --> 06:17:59.478 align:start position:0%
going to give you a diplomatic answer
 
06:18:02.468 --> 06:18:02.478 align:start position:0%
here if a charter school is approved by
 
06:18:04.390 --> 06:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and its
 
06:18:08.150 --> 06:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum is uh congruent with uh a
 
06:18:10.948 --> 06:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
high school education program then it'll
 
06:18:12.468 --> 06:18:12.478 align:start position:0%
probably be deemed a high school
 
06:18:15.310 --> 06:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
education program uh high school
 
06:18:16.868 --> 06:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
education see what I'm trying to head
 
06:18:19.390 --> 06:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
off is this on appeal the New Hampshire
 
06:18:21.390 --> 06:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court as most appellant courts
 
06:18:25.708 --> 06:18:25.718 align:start position:0%
will hold okay is that the the new they
 
06:18:27.708 --> 06:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
will will not add language to
 
06:18:29.708 --> 06:18:29.718 align:start position:0%
legislation the legislature didn't see
 
06:18:33.310 --> 06:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
fit to include okay and they always say
 
06:18:35.948 --> 06:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
and it's could it's all the Appellate
 
06:18:37.910 --> 06:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
decisions I've read and the appeals I've
 
06:18:39.910 --> 06:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
participated in it's all pretty much the
 
06:18:42.910 --> 06:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
same uh if this legislature didn't see
 
06:18:44.628 --> 06:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
fit to put the include the language in
 
06:18:46.350 --> 06:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
the statute we're not going to infer
 
06:18:49.590 --> 06:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's there okay and they are the final
 
06:18:52.590 --> 06:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
AR Arbiter of what legislative intent
 
06:18:54.230 --> 06:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
was so that's the reason why I'm
 
06:18:55.548 --> 06:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
thinking you want to get it in there so
 
06:19:00.030 --> 06:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:02.310 --> 06:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
child did I help did I did I answer your
 
06:19:04.270 --> 06:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
question no thank you sir okay I think
 
06:19:05.590 --> 06:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're good on that and thank you
 
06:19:07.150 --> 06:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
councelor okay thank you very much
 
06:19:08.910 --> 06:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that with that I open the
 
06:19:11.070 --> 06:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
06:19:13.750 --> 06:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
1595 adjustment of Child Support based
 
06:19:16.590 --> 06:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
on parenting time medical support child
 
06:19:20.150 --> 06:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
care expenses and we uh called to the
 
06:19:24.510 --> 06:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
front the bills Prime sponsor who is
 
06:19:25.990 --> 06:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
actually I called him to the front I
 
06:19:27.548 --> 06:19:27.558 align:start position:0%
meant to call him to the witness table
 
06:19:54.750 --> 06:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:54.760 --> 06:20:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
bill

06:20:01.830 --> 06:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:04.788 --> 06:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my uh name is David
 
06:20:11.270 --> 06:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
Bickford I'm here to introduce uh HB
 
06:20:14.110 --> 06:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
1595 which is a about
 
06:20:17.788 --> 06:20:17.798 align:start position:0%
guideline um uh and putting in parenting
 
06:20:20.750 --> 06:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
time adjustments I'm not going to speak
 
06:20:23.750 --> 06:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
to the technical parts of the bill I
 
06:20:24.990 --> 06:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
will tell you that this is where
 
06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
everything pretty much came from from
 
06:20:29.510 --> 06:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
the New
 
06:20:33.390 --> 06:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire review of the child uh child
 
06:20:37.310 --> 06:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
support guidelines which cost
 
06:20:40.628 --> 06:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
$16,000 to get that review and the
 
06:20:42.270 --> 06:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
reason the federal government has us do
 
06:20:45.070 --> 06:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
the reviews because they want to know
 
06:20:47.990 --> 06:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
how much uh deviation there is and if
 
06:20:49.750 --> 06:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's much deviation we're supposed to
 
06:20:53.628 --> 06:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
make uh uh changes in the child support
 
06:20:56.868 --> 06:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
guidelines so uh
 
06:20:58.670 --> 06:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
I worked on this with uh some other
 
06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
people uh represent a majori is here uh
 
06:21:05.270 --> 06:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
and uh he and I have become good friends
 
06:21:06.990 --> 06:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
over this if you recall the first time
 
06:21:09.150 --> 06:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
we met was right
 
06:21:13.590 --> 06:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:17.708 --> 06:21:17.718 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so I guess without further Ado
 
06:21:19.670 --> 06:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
I will go back to my place and we'll
 
06:21:21.910 --> 06:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
hear what uh the others have to say that
 
06:21:24.430 --> 06:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
all right uh it a question from
 
06:21:26.390 --> 06:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative d
 
06:21:28.510 --> 06:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:21:32.430 --> 06:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what year was that
 
06:21:35.708 --> 06:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
report this is uh the this is the uh
 
06:21:35.718 --> 06:21:36.708 align:start position:0%
report this is uh the this is the uh
December

06:21:36.708 --> 06:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
December
 
06:21:36.718 --> 06:21:38.270 align:start position:0%
December
31

06:21:38.270 --> 06:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
31
 
06:21:41.830 --> 06:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
2022 report it's the latest report out I
 
06:21:43.548 --> 06:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
have have I have all the reports
 
06:21:45.708 --> 06:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
actually they happen every four years
 
06:21:48.070 --> 06:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
and follow yeah followup and what years
 
06:21:51.628 --> 06:21:51.638 align:start position:0%
does that include information
 
06:21:55.110 --> 06:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
from well predominantly the last four
 
06:21:56.070 --> 06:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
years but
 
06:21:59.350 --> 06:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
over the spectrum of time but it's about
 
06:22:01.788 --> 06:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
it takes a snapshot of what's going on
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and they do go
 
06:22:05.948 --> 06:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
back in time
 
06:22:09.788 --> 06:22:09.798 align:start position:0%
here um and I can't remember just how
 
06:22:14.110 --> 06:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
far um but they they make a number of
 
06:22:17.030 --> 06:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations in here and one of their
 
06:22:18.468 --> 06:22:18.478 align:start position:0%
major recommendations is to have a
 
06:22:21.430 --> 06:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
parenting time adjustment so is it fair
 
06:22:25.788 --> 06:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
to say that from 2018 forward oh they've
 
06:22:28.070 --> 06:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
been saying that since I think 2004 in
 
06:22:30.430 --> 06:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
that report every four years this report
 
06:22:33.868 --> 06:22:33.878 align:start position:0%
comes out the last one
 
06:22:37.548 --> 06:22:37.558 align:start position:0%
cost I think 50,000 something like that
 
06:22:37.558 --> 06:22:38.868 align:start position:0%
cost I think 50,000 something like that
thank

06:22:38.868 --> 06:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:22:38.878 --> 06:22:42.230 align:start position:0%
thank
you

06:22:42.230 --> 06:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:44.548 --> 06:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
welcome would you be prepared to give us
 
06:22:46.070 --> 06:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
the gist of the bill in about two
 
06:22:48.590 --> 06:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
minutes or would you like to defer to
 
06:22:48.600 --> 06:22:50.590 align:start position:0%
minutes or would you like to defer to
representative

06:22:50.590 --> 06:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:22:54.468 --> 06:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
me uh why don't we don't do
 
06:22:54.478 --> 06:22:56.590 align:start position:0%
me uh why don't we don't do
that

06:22:56.590 --> 06:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:22:58.548 --> 06:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
yeah in the sake of moving on the
 
06:23:00.788 --> 06:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
technical stuff will come from a fellow
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
name of George uh Peace Corp and he help
 
06:23:07.190 --> 06:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
devel okay I'm going to ask you to do
 
06:23:09.230 --> 06:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
two things please number one is on the
 
06:23:11.670 --> 06:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
way to taking your seat fill out a pink
 
06:23:14.030 --> 06:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
card it's a good idea you have to do
 
06:23:16.868 --> 06:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
that and then secondly pass me the pink
 
06:23:21.628 --> 06:23:21.638 align:start position:0%
card and uh since uh there is only one
 
06:23:23.430 --> 06:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
person on the pink card with the name of
 
06:23:26.628 --> 06:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
George Pisco I'm going to call on him to
 
06:23:28.548 --> 06:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
come down
 
06:23:32.110 --> 06:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:36.030 --> 06:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
cor peace core as in what the Kennedy's
 
06:23:38.150 --> 06:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
got going right the peace peace SC like
 
06:23:39.948 --> 06:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
the American peace SC that's what I
 
06:23:43.830 --> 06:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
meant yes really fine fine polish name
 
06:23:52.788 --> 06:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:56.750 --> 06:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay one second here uh yeah goad
 
06:23:58.948 --> 06:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
representative bigford he's filling out
 
06:24:01.670 --> 06:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
a pink C I know I or someone I'm trying
 
06:24:03.190 --> 06:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
to take the notes and I got sidetracked
 
06:24:04.390 --> 06:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
and someone please tell me what the name
 
06:24:08.548 --> 06:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
of the report was the actual
 
06:24:13.468 --> 06:24:13.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:17.070 --> 06:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you for coming uh Mr pcore
 
06:24:19.310 --> 06:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
would you please uh explain to us why
 
06:24:23.310 --> 06:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
this bill should pass okay thank you uh
 
06:24:25.990 --> 06:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the invitation uh Mr chairman and
 
06:24:27.990 --> 06:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
06:24:31.030 --> 06:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
George pcore I'm here on behalf of the
 
06:24:33.230 --> 06:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
National Parents organization New
 
06:24:35.708 --> 06:24:35.718 align:start position:0%
Hamshire chapter and as representative
 
06:24:38.430 --> 06:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
Bickford also uh to state it it's a
 
06:24:40.548 --> 06:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort together with
 
06:24:44.510 --> 06:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
individual parents to uh for this bill
 
06:24:47.070 --> 06:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh the bill has four components and if I
 
06:24:48.670 --> 06:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
may I'll just talk to it rather than
 
06:24:51.230 --> 06:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
reading the written testimony the first
 
06:24:53.750 --> 06:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
two items are direct
 
06:24:56.510 --> 06:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the last quadral
 
06:25:01.788 --> 06:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
review the last two are uh supporting
 
06:25:05.670 --> 06:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations to implement the two so
 
06:25:08.948 --> 06:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
number one parenting time adjustment New
 
06:25:10.948 --> 06:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of only nine states
 
06:25:14.030 --> 06:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
that does not have a formulaic approach
 
06:25:16.390 --> 06:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
to Parenting Time
 
06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
calculation in addition New Hampshire
 
06:25:21.270 --> 06:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
has a deviation rate of
 
06:25:24.270 --> 06:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
40% probably the highest among all
 
06:25:27.830 --> 06:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
states more than half of that is due to
 
06:25:32.110 --> 06:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
issues with parenting time so there is a
 
06:25:35.548 --> 06:25:35.558 align:start position:0%
challenge for us to have a
 
06:25:37.830 --> 06:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
consistent method of calculating
 
06:25:41.270 --> 06:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
parenting time uh that saves un legal
 
06:25:44.670 --> 06:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:47.788 --> 06:25:47.798 align:start position:0%
resources we are
 
06:25:50.390 --> 06:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
proposing what's known as and it's a
 
06:25:54.310 --> 06:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
mouthful 1.5 multiplier model cross
 
06:25:57.548 --> 06:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:01.430 --> 06:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
this mouthful is used by 22 other states
 
06:26:03.430 --> 06:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is not rocket
 
06:26:07.750 --> 06:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
science 18 of which use the 1.5
 
06:26:12.868 --> 06:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
multiplier variant the 05 refers to the
 
06:26:15.390 --> 06:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
assumption that fixed costs account of
 
06:26:21.350 --> 06:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:21.360 --> 06:26:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
cost

06:26:23.830 --> 06:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
cost
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
the the model has been
 
06:26:28.910 --> 06:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
recommended by all parties that were
 
06:26:31.670 --> 06:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
surveyed the last report parents lawyers
 
06:26:33.990 --> 06:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
judges I think it was a second choice
 
06:26:36.430 --> 06:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
approach by
 
06:26:40.430 --> 06:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
bcss we have added two minor refinements
 
06:26:43.270 --> 06:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
to the model to eliminate two known
 
06:26:45.708 --> 06:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
shortcomings of this approach namely the
 
06:26:49.468 --> 06:26:49.478 align:start position:0%
need for a threshold and Cliff effect
 
06:26:51.708 --> 06:26:51.718 align:start position:0%
now Cliff effect and child support
 
06:26:54.310 --> 06:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines is a large change in the
 
06:26:57.310 --> 06:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
child support or order for small
 
06:27:00.390 --> 06:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
parenting time uh
 
06:27:02.830 --> 06:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
shift we've done
 
06:27:05.070 --> 06:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
simulations and compared it to the
 
06:27:06.628 --> 06:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
what's known as the best of class or
 
06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
best of breed models and this approach
 
06:27:12.868 --> 06:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
Compares very favorably we have provided
 
06:27:15.310 --> 06:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
a graph in the written testimony which I
 
06:27:17.430 --> 06:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
believe is uh
 
06:27:19.910 --> 06:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
distributed the second approach or
 
06:27:21.708 --> 06:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
second item is the consistent treatment
 
06:27:25.150 --> 06:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
of medical support and child care costs
 
06:27:27.110 --> 06:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
once again this comes right out of the
 
06:27:29.670 --> 06:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the report which says
 
06:27:32.910 --> 06:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
move these items from income deductions
 
06:27:36.230 --> 06:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
to add-on child costs to be consistent
 
06:27:38.788 --> 06:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
not only with income shares methodology
 
06:27:41.190 --> 06:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
but also to reduce the disproportionate
 
06:27:43.548 --> 06:27:43.558 align:start position:0%
burden on the
 
06:27:46.030 --> 06:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
obligor the next item is the first of
 
06:27:47.990 --> 06:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
the consequential changes to support the
 
06:27:51.628 --> 06:27:51.638 align:start position:0%
first two and that is to
 
06:27:56.510 --> 06:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
include obligor parenting uh sorry child
 
06:27:58.990 --> 06:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
expenditures as part of the ability to
 
06:28:01.590 --> 06:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
pay calculation so this is a technical
 
06:28:03.270 --> 06:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
point right
 
06:28:06.270 --> 06:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
now the difference between adjusted
 
06:28:08.788 --> 06:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
gross income and self-support Reserve is
 
06:28:10.788 --> 06:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
compared is used to determine whether
 
06:28:12.708 --> 06:28:12.718 align:start position:0%
the original order should
 
06:28:15.868 --> 06:28:15.878 align:start position:0%
apply but the obligor also has to meet
 
06:28:18.070 --> 06:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
the obligation of direct expenditures
 
06:28:20.030 --> 06:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's why it's
 
06:28:25.350 --> 06:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
included the last point is the amendment
 
06:28:29.070 --> 06:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
of the income shares methodology from
 
06:28:31.430 --> 06:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
what I call a partial to a full income
 
06:28:31.440 --> 06:28:33.190 align:start position:0%
what I call a partial to a full income
shares

06:28:33.190 --> 06:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
shares
 
06:28:36.070 --> 06:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
methodology uh I think representative
 
06:28:39.110 --> 06:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
Bickford referred to a 2004 report I
 
06:28:42.310 --> 06:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
think this was the HB 310 commission if
 
06:28:44.390 --> 06:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
my mind uh serves me
 
06:28:46.830 --> 06:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
correctly which identified that the
 
06:28:48.708 --> 06:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
original intent to implement an income
 
06:28:50.990 --> 06:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
shares methodology was done incorrectly
 
06:28:54.590 --> 06:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
for whatever reasons so we are proposing
 
06:28:56.110 --> 06:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
that this be
 
06:29:00.868 --> 06:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
corrected so that all child costs are
 
06:29:04.350 --> 06:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
calculated on a prated
 
06:29:07.110 --> 06:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
manner based on the relative income of
 
06:29:09.070 --> 06:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
both parents this is what the income
 
06:29:11.390 --> 06:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
shares methodology is supposed to be
 
06:29:13.230 --> 06:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
it's known as the proportional
 
06:29:13.240 --> 06:29:15.310 align:start position:0%
it's known as the proportional
contributions

06:29:15.310 --> 06:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
06:29:21.190 --> 06:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
principle uh the this is also consistent
 
06:29:23.390 --> 06:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
in my recent readings of the Supreme
 
06:29:26.190 --> 06:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
Court literature with the Anderson
 
06:29:29.510 --> 06:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
decision which affirmed that New
 
06:29:32.750 --> 06:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uses the income shares
 
06:29:32.760 --> 06:29:34.708 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uses the income shares
methodology

06:29:34.708 --> 06:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
06:29:38.990 --> 06:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
prated for total child costs on relative
 
06:29:42.270 --> 06:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
incomes so those are the four items uh
 
06:29:43.670 --> 06:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to
 
06:29:46.070 --> 06:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
overview them uh these are all technical
 
06:29:49.030 --> 06:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
in nature uh and I'll be pleased to
 
06:29:53.830 --> 06:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:53.840 --> 06:29:57.628 align:start position:0%
 
questions

06:29:57.628 --> 06:29:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:59.390 --> 06:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
I give the committee a minute or two to
 
06:30:01.150 --> 06:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
look through that report and see if they
 
06:30:01.160 --> 06:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
look through that report and see if they
have

06:30:16.070 --> 06:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:19.910 --> 06:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
any Mr chair May yes representative
 
06:30:24.150 --> 06:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
Bickford um thank you Mr chairman thank
 
06:30:26.070 --> 06:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my my question you
 
06:30:27.628 --> 06:30:27.638 align:start position:0%
started to say something about other
 
06:30:30.070 --> 06:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
states and what other states have done
 
06:30:31.270 --> 06:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
and I thought you said something about
 
06:30:32.628 --> 06:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
Oregon and
 
06:30:37.230 --> 06:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
California uh use this um you introduced
 
06:30:40.350 --> 06:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
the bill you cannot ask
 
06:30:45.190 --> 06:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:48.670 --> 06:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
other you wrote us and told us what to
 
06:30:52.270 --> 06:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
do yeah you either you either speak from
 
06:30:55.868 --> 06:30:55.878 align:start position:0%
that table or you speak from that table
 
06:30:57.948 --> 06:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
all right I spoke to you about that but
 
06:31:00.948 --> 06:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
okay you don't recall I guess not now
 
06:31:03.070 --> 06:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
wait a minute though is it are you would
 
06:31:04.868 --> 06:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
you say that you really didn't do
 
06:31:06.548 --> 06:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
anything except Hi here's the bill you
 
06:31:08.868 --> 06:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
didn't argue for it over there right
 
06:31:10.948 --> 06:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to Turn You Loose oh go
 
06:31:13.548 --> 06:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
ahead sorry exception to the rule thank
 
06:31:16.310 --> 06:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
you you're chairman I am that's why I
 
06:31:18.190 --> 06:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
get the
 
06:31:20.948 --> 06:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
money well anyway could you give us how
 
06:31:23.350 --> 06:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
this fits in with the rest of the nation
 
06:31:27.150 --> 06:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
or world you know what's going on what's
 
06:31:31.708 --> 06:31:31.718 align:start position:0%
happening out there yeah uh well again
 
06:31:35.468 --> 06:31:35.478 align:start position:0%
uh 42 states have parenting time
 
06:31:38.590 --> 06:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment models half of them use the
 
06:31:40.830 --> 06:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
multiplier model methodology that we are
 
06:31:42.990 --> 06:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
proposing here with a
 
06:31:45.868 --> 06:31:45.878 align:start position:0%
refinement uh three of them use what's
 
06:31:47.948 --> 06:31:47.958 align:start position:0%
known as a sliding scale method this is
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
like varying percentage of Step
 
06:31:52.590 --> 06:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
depending on the income it's the crudest
 
06:31:56.310 --> 06:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
method uh but it has the advantage of
 
06:32:01.310 --> 06:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
Simplicity uh States like Oregon Oregon
 
06:32:03.750 --> 06:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
have developed a complicated
 
06:32:05.868 --> 06:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
mathematical model which if you graph it
 
06:32:08.830 --> 06:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
looks like an scurve and economists say
 
06:32:11.070 --> 06:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's the way it should look
 
06:32:14.310 --> 06:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
ideally uh in our simulations we
 
06:32:17.310 --> 06:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
actually approach that very closely even
 
06:32:19.190 --> 06:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
though the income shares model that's
 
06:32:21.628 --> 06:32:21.638 align:start position:0%
been recommended sorry the multiplier
 
06:32:24.070 --> 06:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
model that's been recommended in Prior
 
06:32:26.670 --> 06:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
reports and the most recent reports is
 
06:32:28.628 --> 06:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
what's known as a peace wise linear in
 
06:32:30.910 --> 06:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
other words it's not exactly a curve but
 
06:32:33.468 --> 06:32:33.478 align:start position:0%
it approximates a curve and I apologize
 
06:32:36.548 --> 06:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
for the techie Babble but we are talking
 
06:32:39.788 --> 06:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
about a technical issue here California
 
06:32:41.948 --> 06:32:41.958 align:start position:0%
also is known as having a best of breed
 
06:32:46.230 --> 06:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
model and in our hand out uh our written
 
06:32:49.628 --> 06:32:49.638 align:start position:0%
testimony we have done a simulation and
 
06:32:52.190 --> 06:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
they look very close so you're in good
 
06:32:55.628 --> 06:32:55.638 align:start position:0%
company best to breed
 
06:32:57.590 --> 06:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
good any other
 
06:33:01.670 --> 06:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:04.190 --> 06:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
Nelson representative
 
06:33:07.070 --> 06:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
Raymond sorry I I reached my hand way
 
06:33:09.270 --> 06:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
out hoping you'll notice it not thinking
 
06:33:10.430 --> 06:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
it would be mistaken for a
 
06:33:13.150 --> 06:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
representative dset so thank you Mr
 
06:33:13.160 --> 06:33:14.910 align:start position:0%
representative dset so thank you Mr
chairman

06:33:14.910 --> 06:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
so I know it's very late for math um but
 
06:33:23.910 --> 06:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
my question is about how passing this
 
06:33:27.230 --> 06:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
bill will impact um our families who
 
06:33:30.948 --> 06:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
already have child support orders and
 
06:33:35.070 --> 06:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
parenting time orders um so we recently
 
06:33:36.830 --> 06:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
the house passed and who knows what the
 
06:33:38.830 --> 06:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
Senate will do with it a an
 
06:33:41.750 --> 06:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting time Bill
 
06:33:43.990 --> 06:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
and then now we have this bill and I'm
 
06:33:47.910 --> 06:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
wondering how um this will impact our
 
06:33:50.230 --> 06:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds and thousands of families that
 
06:33:52.750 --> 06:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
are having current support orders will
 
06:33:54.548 --> 06:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
all of those people have to troop back
 
06:33:57.708 --> 06:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
to court and do the form over again do
 
06:34:00.310 --> 06:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
there does there have to be um like an
 
06:34:02.190 --> 06:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
instigating event you know what I mean
 
06:34:05.548 --> 06:34:05.558 align:start position:0%
in order to redo it will we I understand
 
06:34:07.670 --> 06:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
the question completely if I may
 
06:34:10.030 --> 06:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
interrupt understand it completely and
 
06:34:12.350 --> 06:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm internally chuckling because in our
 
06:34:14.750 --> 06:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
working group meetings this is exactly
 
06:34:16.590 --> 06:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
the issue that we discussed it's a very
 
06:34:18.990 --> 06:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
06:34:22.948 --> 06:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh section six of applicability in the
 
06:34:25.868 --> 06:34:25.878 align:start position:0%
bill answers that that essentially it
 
06:34:29.070 --> 06:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
would only apply to new bills or for
 
06:34:31.628 --> 06:34:31.638 align:start position:0%
existing bills when they come up for
 
06:34:35.350 --> 06:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
regular review which is three
 
06:34:38.190 --> 06:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
years and
 
06:34:41.510 --> 06:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh it says the ACT shall not constitute
 
06:34:44.070 --> 06:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
a substantial change in circumstances
 
06:34:46.590 --> 06:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
for purposes of the section in other
 
06:34:49.310 --> 06:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
words people can argue well this is a
 
06:34:52.190 --> 06:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
new bill and uh therefore I want another
 
06:34:55.270 --> 06:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
crack at it the answer is no wait your
 
06:34:58.628 --> 06:34:58.638 align:start position:0%
turn okay thank you I'm sorry I was
 
06:35:00.430 --> 06:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
looking for Roman numeral six and I did
 
06:35:03.230 --> 06:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
not find it thank you oh sorry as you
 
06:35:04.628 --> 06:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
said it's it's late the day and we're
 
06:35:07.230 --> 06:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
talking math so whether it's uh binary

the great town of
 
06:35:51.350 --> 06:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
Northampton um I come I come to this
 
06:35:53.548 --> 06:35:53.558 align:start position:0%
bill in this information uh without
 
06:35:56.350 --> 06:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
having any personal experience with
 
06:35:59.628 --> 06:35:59.638 align:start position:0%
divorce separation or child care support
 
06:36:01.548 --> 06:36:01.558 align:start position:0%
uh when I first learned about it it was
 
06:36:03.350 --> 06:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
when I was first campaigning six years
 
06:36:05.230 --> 06:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
ago so I started doing my
 
06:36:07.990 --> 06:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
research uh started looking into what
 
06:36:09.990 --> 06:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
has happened where have we been where
 
06:36:13.388 --> 06:36:13.398 align:start position:0%
have we gone oh my goodness if you do
 
06:36:15.910 --> 06:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
that research you'll go back to 1989 and
 
06:36:18.510 --> 06:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
you will see at least representative
 
06:36:20.628 --> 06:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
Bickford's name on
 
06:36:23.708 --> 06:36:23.718 align:start position:0%
98% of those bills and I think maybe
 
06:36:26.310 --> 06:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
even more than than that this is a this
 
06:36:29.510 --> 06:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
is a subject that I appreciate this body
 
06:36:31.750 --> 06:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
both bodies have spent an enormous
 
06:36:34.510 --> 06:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
amount of time researching and in the
 
06:36:37.430 --> 06:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
time that I have uh reviewed some of the
 
06:36:40.070 --> 06:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
studies from 2 excuse me from
 
06:36:44.788 --> 06:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
1995 2003 especially this one uh 2005 uh
 
06:36:46.310 --> 06:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
especially this one from
 
06:36:48.628 --> 06:36:48.638 align:start position:0%
2022 what I have noticed and what I want
 
06:36:51.388 --> 06:36:51.398 align:start position:0%
to stress is that these bodies hours and
 
06:36:53.070 --> 06:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
the one across the wall can I say that
 
06:36:54.948 --> 06:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
do I say that here or can I say only
 
06:36:57.430 --> 06:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
with a sneer only with a sneer the
 
06:37:01.750 --> 06:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
Senate oo okay we have always relied on
 
06:37:04.110 --> 06:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
the most valuable upto-date information
 
06:37:06.750 --> 06:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
that we have we have always relied on
 
06:37:08.750 --> 06:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
the technical expertise of the experts
 
06:37:10.548 --> 06:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
who have testified and submitted that
 
06:37:12.868 --> 06:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
information to us before we make those
 
06:37:14.548 --> 06:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
decisions on how we are going to mend
 
06:37:16.990 --> 06:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
our statutes and I feel and I have come
 
06:37:21.150 --> 06:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
to learn from representative Bickford Mr
 
06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
peace core and others on the working
 
06:37:25.150 --> 06:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
group that we have been part of for the
 
06:37:27.548 --> 06:37:27.558 align:start position:0%
better part of a year that this
 
06:37:29.590 --> 06:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
represents the latest information that
 
06:37:32.270 --> 06:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
we have to make the best choices for the
 
06:37:34.548 --> 06:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
children and the families in our state
 
06:37:37.868 --> 06:37:37.878 align:start position:0%
is it perfect clearly looking back again
 
06:37:39.830 --> 06:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
as far as I could go on our website to
 
06:37:42.990 --> 06:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
1989 there will always be an opportunity
 
06:37:46.150 --> 06:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
to find something that is better but I I
 
06:37:49.030 --> 06:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
beg of us that we do not discard what I
 
06:37:51.548 --> 06:37:51.558 align:start position:0%
consider to be the best option right now
 
06:37:53.750 --> 06:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
for what will we will never find which
 
06:37:56.708 --> 06:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
will be the perfect I have come to say
 
06:37:59.708 --> 06:37:59.718 align:start position:0%
that HB 1595 represents the best of the
 
06:38:01.750 --> 06:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
information we have and I urge the
 
06:38:03.388 --> 06:38:03.398 align:start position:0%
committee to pass this bill so that we
 
06:38:06.270 --> 06:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
can send it to the Senate and and and
 
06:38:08.388 --> 06:38:08.398 align:start position:0%
urge for their support also thank you Mr
 
06:38:09.628 --> 06:38:09.638 align:start position:0%
chair and I'm happy to take any
 
06:38:12.070 --> 06:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
non-technical questions or I will defer
 
06:38:20.150 --> 06:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:23.548 --> 06:38:23.558 align:start position:0%
numbers thank you thank you chair
 
06:38:30.350 --> 06:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:34.468 --> 06:38:34.478 align:start position:0%
gley good afternoon and uh thank you Mr
 
06:38:36.310 --> 06:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
06:38:38.628 --> 06:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
bear with me this is my first uh public
 
06:38:41.230 --> 06:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
testimony so have some nerves so bear
 
06:38:42.990 --> 06:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
with me um I have a written written
 
06:38:46.510 --> 06:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
statement in favor of uh house build
 
06:38:49.190 --> 06:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
1595 um so I'm just going to read
 
06:38:51.868 --> 06:38:51.878 align:start position:0%
it and uh welcome to questions at the
 
06:38:54.788 --> 06:38:54.798 align:start position:0%
end uh so I'm I'm here because I support
 
06:38:57.468 --> 06:38:57.478 align:start position:0%
this bill uh because the New Hampshire
 
06:38:59.548 --> 06:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
existing child support system is broken
 
06:39:02.510 --> 06:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
and is a significant root cause of high
 
06:39:04.468 --> 06:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
legal cost to nontraditional families in
 
06:39:06.670 --> 06:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
our state uh families that have been
 
06:39:08.388 --> 06:39:08.398 align:start position:0%
impacted by a divorce or just
 
06:39:08.398 --> 06:39:09.708 align:start position:0%
impacted by a divorce or just
non-traditional

06:39:09.708 --> 06:39:09.718 align:start position:0%
non-traditional
 
06:39:11.868 --> 06:39:11.878 align:start position:0%
families uh this bill will establish an
 
06:39:13.430 --> 06:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
improved framework that will more
 
06:39:14.990 --> 06:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
effectively and fairly ensure that both
 
06:39:16.590 --> 06:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
parents are able to financially support
 
06:39:18.230 --> 06:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
their children it will ensure that both
 
06:39:19.628 --> 06:39:19.638 align:start position:0%
parents have stake in the financial
 
06:39:21.230 --> 06:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
well-being of their non-traditional
 
06:39:23.310 --> 06:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
family unit resulting in a net benefit
 
06:39:25.190 --> 06:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire children Children and
 
06:39:28.388 --> 06:39:28.398 align:start position:0%
Families um I have personally navigated
 
06:39:29.830 --> 06:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire child support
 
06:39:34.270 --> 06:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
system since uh 2016 2017 is when I
 
06:39:36.070 --> 06:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
first was
 
06:39:39.350 --> 06:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh separated uh and I've spent
 
06:39:41.910 --> 06:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars on legal fees uh
 
06:39:44.030 --> 06:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
which I would have uh much rather gone
 
06:39:45.708 --> 06:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
to my children's College savings
 
06:39:49.150 --> 06:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
accounts um I've got two children uh 12
 
06:39:51.910 --> 06:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
and 10 um earlier in
 
06:39:54.510 --> 06:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
2023 uh most recently the cour issued an
 
06:39:56.750 --> 06:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
order that resulted in me paying uh my
 
06:39:59.430 --> 06:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
co-parent a full uniform support order
 
06:40:01.548 --> 06:40:01.558 align:start position:0%
uh meaning I pay the same percentage as
 
06:40:04.110 --> 06:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
a parent that has basically no custody
 
06:40:06.468 --> 06:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
no physical custody of their children um
 
06:40:08.468 --> 06:40:08.478 align:start position:0%
I however I have phys physical custody
 
06:40:11.150 --> 06:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
of my children uh 50% of their time I've
 
06:40:14.230 --> 06:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
had that since day one uh of being
 
06:40:18.030 --> 06:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
separated um I coach their sports teams
 
06:40:20.030 --> 06:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
I furnish a bedroom for each of them I
 
06:40:22.110 --> 06:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
buy them clothes I drive them places I
 
06:40:24.468 --> 06:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
feed them take them on vacations uh
 
06:40:26.868 --> 06:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
purchase toiletries medicine gifts gifts
 
06:40:29.388 --> 06:40:29.398 align:start position:0%
for their friends gifts for their
 
06:40:34.070 --> 06:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
teachers um I also pay um 75% of their
 
06:40:36.548 --> 06:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
outof pocket Health Care um I save for
 
06:40:39.110 --> 06:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
their college so on top of those
 
06:40:42.670 --> 06:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
day-to-day fixed and variable costs um I
 
06:40:46.468 --> 06:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
pay 20,000 over $20,000 a year in child
 
06:40:49.430 --> 06:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
support to my co-parent um after taxes
 
06:40:51.590 --> 06:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
and and payroll reductions I take home
 
06:40:54.388 --> 06:40:54.398 align:start position:0%
less than $65,000 per year which the
 
06:40:57.788 --> 06:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
$20,000 is pulled from um that means
 
06:41:00.868 --> 06:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
there's nearly four months of the year
 
06:41:02.868 --> 06:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
that I work before I start earning money
 
06:41:05.910 --> 06:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
for my household um I've never missed a
 
06:41:07.270 --> 06:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
child support payment I've never been
 
06:41:10.110 --> 06:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
late to make a payment um I would never
 
06:41:12.628 --> 06:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
you know allow my children to live in
 
06:41:15.670 --> 06:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
poverty as long as I can help it um I'd
 
06:41:17.230 --> 06:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
be happy for my kids to live with me
 
06:41:21.750 --> 06:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
100% of the time um my co-parent not to
 
06:41:23.910 --> 06:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
get into a lot of detail about this but
 
06:41:25.750 --> 06:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
they have a a bachelor's degree from the
 
06:41:27.948 --> 06:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
same University as I do they graduated
 
06:41:30.388 --> 06:41:30.398 align:start position:0%
in the same year as I did in fact we
 
06:41:32.830 --> 06:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
worked for the same company um the
 
06:41:35.070 --> 06:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
company that I still work for uh before
 
06:41:37.150 --> 06:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
they decided to stop working and change
 
06:41:39.788 --> 06:41:39.798 align:start position:0%
their career path uh my co-parent has
 
06:41:41.350 --> 06:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
had the same opportunities as me and the
 
06:41:43.548 --> 06:41:43.558 align:start position:0%
same degree of Education in much broader
 
06:41:45.990 --> 06:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
local Family Support Network but due to
 
06:41:48.990 --> 06:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
the to to career choices uh they learn
 
06:41:52.388 --> 06:41:52.398 align:start position:0%
less income than I do um So within the
 
06:41:54.990 --> 06:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
framework of our existing system they
 
06:41:57.030 --> 06:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
have limited incentive to earn more
 
06:41:58.830 --> 06:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
income due to the money they receive
 
06:42:02.150 --> 06:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
from me after taxes so this Dynamic puts
 
06:42:05.350 --> 06:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
an unfair burden on uh the higher income
 
06:42:07.310 --> 06:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
parent in co-parenting families like
 
06:42:10.670 --> 06:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
mine who ultimately support two homes in
 
06:42:13.590 --> 06:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
some cases uh despite having pretty even
 
06:42:15.670 --> 06:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
capabilities Mr gley you asked for two
 
06:42:18.430 --> 06:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
to three minutes what am I at you are on
 
06:42:21.948 --> 06:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
a roll um so and and it's all good stuff
 
06:42:24.990 --> 06:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
I just about done I got one paragraph
 
06:42:29.270 --> 06:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
I apologize for that I go ahead so I I
 
06:42:30.868 --> 06:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
just wrap by saying the existing system
 
06:42:32.110 --> 06:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that families are
 
06:42:34.468 --> 06:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh to anyone who
 
06:42:36.590 --> 06:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
understands Equity fairness the system
 
06:42:39.910 --> 06:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
is obviously not working it's flawed I
 
06:42:42.628 --> 06:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
hear from many friends who dealt with
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
this and people are talking about it uh
 
06:42:46.310 --> 06:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
so I think New Hampshire owes it to
 
06:42:48.350 --> 06:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
Children of divorced parents to to fix
 
06:42:51.388 --> 06:42:51.398 align:start position:0%
the system so thank you thank you and if
 
06:42:54.030 --> 06:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
you don't mind if you could submit your
 
06:42:56.510 --> 06:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
testimony to the clerk because we file
 
06:42:59.190 --> 06:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
these things I meant to print out enough
 
06:43:01.110 --> 06:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
copies I just didn't have time so I can
 
06:43:03.868 --> 06:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
happy to email the copy if you wish but
 
06:43:05.750 --> 06:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
if your hard copy could go to the clerk
 
06:43:07.548 --> 06:43:07.558 align:start position:0%
all printed out she can put it in the
 
06:43:10.708 --> 06:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
folder and and believe me uh I'm told
 
06:43:13.270 --> 06:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
that down the road sometimes judges when
 
06:43:14.868 --> 06:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
they're trying to decide something want
 
06:43:16.868 --> 06:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
to know what the legislature was talking
 
06:43:19.190 --> 06:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
about and it's not just us it's you
 
06:43:21.310 --> 06:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
folks and these documents sometimes come
 
06:43:24.430 --> 06:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
into play great so good thank you thank
 
06:43:27.948 --> 06:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes um also from
 
06:43:31.628 --> 06:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
Atkinson and also named Jay marel thank
 
06:43:34.628 --> 06:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr shair Esquire yes thank you sir
 
06:43:37.190 --> 06:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
um I've looked at this bill this isn't
 
06:43:40.548 --> 06:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
the first time I've seen it and um in
 
06:43:43.388 --> 06:43:43.398 align:start position:0%
its in different forms and just by way
 
06:43:45.388 --> 06:43:45.398 align:start position:0%
of background I've been involved in
 
06:43:47.910 --> 06:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
legislation uh one way or another since
 
06:43:47.920 --> 06:43:49.110 align:start position:0%
legislation uh one way or another since
about

06:43:49.110 --> 06:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:43:51.350 --> 06:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
2015 uh involved in drafting and
 
06:43:51.360 --> 06:43:52.468 align:start position:0%
2015 uh involved in drafting and
reviewing

06:43:52.468 --> 06:43:52.478 align:start position:0%
reviewing
 
06:43:55.830 --> 06:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
legislation uh one of the challenges
 
06:43:58.430 --> 06:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
here is the inherent and let me just be
 
06:44:01.310 --> 06:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief uh New Hampshire if you
 
06:44:03.468 --> 06:44:03.478 align:start position:0%
look at RSA
 
06:44:03.478 --> 06:44:05.788 align:start position:0%
look at RSA
4461

06:44:05.788 --> 06:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
4461
 
06:44:09.788 --> 06:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
A14 has never linked CH uh the
 
06:44:12.070 --> 06:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of time that a parent spends
 
06:44:14.510 --> 06:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
with a child to the to a child support
 
06:44:18.628 --> 06:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
order it never has um the parenting
 
06:44:20.708 --> 06:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities act has been
 
06:44:23.910 --> 06:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
around since about 2005 in various
 
06:44:25.948 --> 06:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
considerations basically the support if
 
06:44:28.230 --> 06:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
you look at section one is that after a
 
06:44:30.670 --> 06:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
filing uh Court shall make such further
 
06:44:32.548 --> 06:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
decree in relation to the support and
 
06:44:34.708 --> 06:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
education of children as shall be most
 
06:44:36.548 --> 06:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
conducive to their benefit in order a
 
06:44:39.070 --> 06:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable provision for their support
 
06:44:40.708 --> 06:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
but what you do is you now create a
 
06:44:42.590 --> 06:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
tension between the amount of parenting
 
06:44:44.548 --> 06:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
time and what's most beneficial for
 
06:44:46.948 --> 06:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
their support and one of the other
 
06:44:48.868 --> 06:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
problems that I've said and by the way
 
06:44:51.590 --> 06:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
in doing this I've re I've reviewed
 
06:44:53.990 --> 06:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
child support uh guidelines across the
 
06:44:57.350 --> 06:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
United States I would also recommend for
 
06:45:00.350 --> 06:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
reading is child support application and
 
06:45:02.350 --> 06:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines by Laura Morgan it's
 
06:45:05.230 --> 06:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
published by Walters Clues I have a copy
 
06:45:06.708 --> 06:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
of the second edition which is the
 
06:45:09.310 --> 06:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
latest it's about this thick and it is
 
06:45:11.070 --> 06:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
she's one of the leading Authorities on
 
06:45:13.110 --> 06:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
child support and how it's implemented
 
06:45:15.788 --> 06:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
across the United States um to address a
 
06:45:17.388 --> 06:45:17.398 align:start position:0%
couple of things first of all we do have
 
06:45:20.270 --> 06:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of deviations and which means from
 
06:45:22.388 --> 06:45:22.398 align:start position:0%
the guidelines and one of the problems
 
06:45:24.670 --> 06:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
that I've seen is is that there's almost
 
06:45:27.270 --> 06:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
nothing that really works for everybody
 
06:45:29.628 --> 06:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
100% of the time so I would agree with
 
06:45:32.510 --> 06:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
the proponents of that legislation the
 
06:45:34.750 --> 06:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
problem is is that child support
 
06:45:37.310 --> 06:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily becomes so individuated to
 
06:45:40.230 --> 06:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
to develop these supports and I realized
 
06:45:43.670 --> 06:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
what Washington DC did years ago in the
 
06:45:46.388 --> 06:45:46.398 align:start position:0%
early 80s to try to bring in guidelines
 
06:45:48.868 --> 06:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
and the precise problem is with a lot of
 
06:45:50.788 --> 06:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
the changes such as joint parenting and
 
06:45:52.750 --> 06:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth it just creates
 
06:45:54.628 --> 06:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
problems and the best way to solve them
 
06:45:56.350 --> 06:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
is to really create individuated
 
06:45:58.788 --> 06:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
Solutions what the good part about what
 
06:46:01.868 --> 06:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
this bill does is is that it tries to
 
06:46:04.468 --> 06:46:04.478 align:start position:0%
dis it tries to undo one of the problems
 
06:46:06.190 --> 06:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
with the Sila case I don't know if
 
06:46:08.910 --> 06:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with it okay that was
 
06:46:12.110 --> 06:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
the one that um the Sila case was the
 
06:46:13.990 --> 06:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
one that created I'm not going to say
 
06:46:15.310 --> 06:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
created problems because the New
 
06:46:17.030 --> 06:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court simply dealt
 
06:46:18.628 --> 06:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
with the legislation that it had and
 
06:46:20.788 --> 06:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
said this is what it means so what it's
 
06:46:23.388 --> 06:46:23.398 align:start position:0%
done here which is positive which is if
 
06:46:25.628 --> 06:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
tries to eliminate the impact uh the
 
06:46:28.190 --> 06:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
unfair impact of a full guidelines order
 
06:46:30.230 --> 06:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
on people who have joined custody so
 
06:46:32.230 --> 06:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
what this tries to do is say okay if we
 
06:46:34.310 --> 06:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
take a certain percentage and we go like
 
06:46:36.310 --> 06:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
this and we use parenting time we'll be
 
06:46:38.270 --> 06:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
able to come up with a fairer order I
 
06:46:40.868 --> 06:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
get that but the problem but what you're
 
06:46:42.388 --> 06:46:42.398 align:start position:0%
doing is you're creating an inherent
 
06:46:45.430 --> 06:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
tension here between the first part of
 
06:46:50.830 --> 06:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh 468 461 A14 and this remember this
 
06:46:53.388 --> 06:46:53.398 align:start position:0%
461a is the parenting rights and resp
 
06:46:56.590 --> 06:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility act that's the overall
 
06:46:58.830 --> 06:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
architecture for parenting rights and
 
06:47:00.990 --> 06:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
how we raise children remember that the
 
06:47:03.150 --> 06:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines are merely the
 
06:47:05.150 --> 06:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which child support is
 
06:47:08.030 --> 06:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
calculated so what we're doing is do we
 
06:47:10.910 --> 06:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
want the na so the parents are supposed
 
06:47:13.070 --> 06:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
to drive the car they're not supposed to
 
06:47:14.670 --> 06:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
have the car drive no matter what
 
06:47:16.750 --> 06:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
everybody says about Elon Musk they're
 
06:47:18.990 --> 06:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
not supposed to have the car driving
 
06:47:22.030 --> 06:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
itself it's not there yet um what I
 
06:47:23.910 --> 06:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully recommend is this can be
 
06:47:26.388 --> 06:47:26.398 align:start position:0%
improved I think I think it needs to be
 
06:47:28.430 --> 06:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
made a little less complicated I think
 
06:47:30.948 --> 06:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
it needs a little more study I can also
 
06:47:33.910 --> 06:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
agree that the uh child support
 
06:47:36.548 --> 06:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
guidelines are widely perceived as
 
06:47:39.150 --> 06:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
unfair uh to a lot of people and one of
 
06:47:41.388 --> 06:47:41.398 align:start position:0%
the reasons why is because they have no
 
06:47:43.310 --> 06:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
upper limit in the state of New
 
06:47:47.070 --> 06:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other states they do uh but
 
06:47:48.708 --> 06:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where it is I'll be happy
 
06:47:50.868 --> 06:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
to entertain any questions if anybody
 
06:47:50.878 --> 06:47:52.230 align:start position:0%
to entertain any questions if anybody
has

06:47:52.230 --> 06:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:47:52.240 --> 06:47:56.070 align:start position:0%
has
them

06:47:56.070 --> 06:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:59.150 --> 06:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
um representative bigford thank you uh
 
06:48:02.110 --> 06:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes sir thank you um the
 
06:48:03.430 --> 06:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
upper limit is not an issue with this
 
06:48:05.830 --> 06:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill is it this well it still is in
 
06:48:07.150 --> 06:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
other words you don't have an upper
 
06:48:09.230 --> 06:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
limit here okay what you do is you have
 
06:48:10.788 --> 06:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for calculating the
 
06:48:13.788 --> 06:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
guidelines but uh you don't have I'm
 
06:48:15.628 --> 06:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
going make sure I'm getting heard okay
 
06:48:17.230 --> 06:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
but you don't have an upper limit in the
 
06:48:19.590 --> 06:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill so for example if you have somebody
 
06:48:22.350 --> 06:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
making six or seven or eight or 900 or a
 
06:48:25.350 --> 06:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
thousand 100 or uh 3/4 of a million
 
06:48:27.628 --> 06:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
dollars a year uh you know you get the
 
06:48:30.510 --> 06:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
guideline and that's your number
 
06:48:33.110 --> 06:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh there you know there should be an
 
06:48:34.990 --> 06:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
upper limit to it there is currently in
 
06:48:37.788 --> 06:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
the child support statute uh they try to
 
06:48:41.150 --> 06:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
avoid unnecessary confiscatory and un
 
06:48:43.788 --> 06:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
unreasonably low orders right okay but
 
06:48:46.990 --> 06:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
there is no upper limit to it right okay
 
06:48:49.190 --> 06:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
we I'm sorry go ahead we we tried to
 
06:48:51.830 --> 06:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
follow the recommendations here and I
 
06:48:53.510 --> 06:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't recall that being one of the
 
06:48:55.468 --> 06:48:55.478 align:start position:0%
recommendations yeah and I'm I'm
 
06:48:57.590 --> 06:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with the reports that UNH did
 
06:48:59.468 --> 06:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
if those are the same reports yeah four
 
06:49:01.910 --> 06:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
years before right okay I'm familiar
 
06:49:03.548 --> 06:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
with those and I've read them and I I've
 
06:49:05.830 --> 06:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
read them when they first came out
 
06:49:09.910 --> 06:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
so Dr Smith yeah I think so and they
 
06:49:11.628 --> 06:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
have some good points in it and the
 
06:49:13.110 --> 06:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
things need to be changed but I think it
 
06:49:15.070 --> 06:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
needs a little more study uh I've been
 
06:49:16.430 --> 06:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with these things for quite a
 
06:49:20.548 --> 06:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
while and um nothing will satisfy
 
06:49:22.628 --> 06:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
everybody uh one of the things that we
 
06:49:24.670 --> 06:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
had that were works well most of the
 
06:49:26.788 --> 06:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
time which is called the child support
 
06:49:28.310 --> 06:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
offset which deals with shared
 
06:49:30.430 --> 06:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
residential responsibility which was
 
06:49:32.788 --> 06:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
working well for years and what you did
 
06:49:34.830 --> 06:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
which doesn't include this and it works
 
06:49:36.948 --> 06:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
well most of the time which is where you
 
06:49:40.628 --> 06:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
take parent A's income parent B's income
 
06:49:42.150 --> 06:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
take the difference and then if you have
 
06:49:44.310 --> 06:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
shared residential or approximately
 
06:49:47.070 --> 06:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
equal residential responsibility parent
 
06:49:49.270 --> 06:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
A's income parent calculate the
 
06:49:52.190 --> 06:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines as if parent a pays parent B
 
06:49:54.310 --> 06:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
calculate the guid line says if parent a
 
06:49:57.190 --> 06:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
pays par parent B pays parent a then
 
06:49:58.830 --> 06:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what the difference is and
 
06:50:00.468 --> 06:50:00.478 align:start position:0%
the and the difference goes to the lower
 
06:50:03.070 --> 06:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
earning parent okay that's one thing
 
06:50:05.948 --> 06:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
that works most of the time and usually
 
06:50:07.830 --> 06:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
with some adjustments you can get
 
06:50:10.510 --> 06:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
equality uh where the CH where the where
 
06:50:12.628 --> 06:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
the child which is one of the goals is
 
06:50:15.430 --> 06:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the child has an
 
06:50:17.670 --> 06:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
approximately equal standard of living
 
06:50:19.708 --> 06:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
in both households which is what the
 
06:50:22.310 --> 06:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
point of the guidelines are okay and
 
06:50:23.948 --> 06:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
that's what the point of the um that's
 
06:50:26.030 --> 06:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
what the point of the statute was so I'm
 
06:50:27.548 --> 06:50:27.558 align:start position:0%
not trying to be convoluted it's a
 
06:50:29.948 --> 06:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
compli it's a complicated problem I only
 
06:50:31.590 --> 06:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
have a few minutes I get it I'm only
 
06:50:33.388 --> 06:50:33.398 align:start position:0%
thinking that you may want to study it a
 
06:50:34.990 --> 06:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more and you may want to make
 
06:50:36.430 --> 06:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
some fine tunings to make sure that it
 
06:50:39.628 --> 06:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
can work thank you so much for your
 
06:50:42.750 --> 06:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it uh for the
 
06:50:46.388 --> 06:50:46.398 align:start position:0%
committee remember um we do not have the
 
06:50:48.310 --> 06:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
option of retaining the bill to work on
 
06:50:51.788 --> 06:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
it over the summer all we have is the
 
06:50:55.070 --> 06:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
ability to say this bill has Merit for
 
06:50:58.190 --> 06:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
future legislation or this bill does not
 
06:51:01.270 --> 06:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
so since this is an early bill this has
 
06:51:04.230 --> 06:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
to be out the door by Thursday February
 
06:51:07.468 --> 06:51:07.478 align:start position:0%
15th which means for us it's Tuesday
 
06:51:12.750 --> 06:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
February 13th so uh I will listen we we
 
06:51:14.670 --> 06:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
will take testimony happily take
 
06:51:17.590 --> 06:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
testimony from the two remaining people
 
06:51:20.670 --> 06:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
who signed up but uh I'm not going to
 
06:51:24.948 --> 06:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
suggest that we um execute today I am
 
06:51:29.708 --> 06:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
going to suggest that if uh you wish to
 
06:51:32.670 --> 06:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
work further with the prime sponsor and
 
06:51:36.270 --> 06:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
the other sponsors feel free to do it if
 
06:51:38.190 --> 06:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
you want to do it very informally you
 
06:51:40.628 --> 06:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
may do that as you wish if you wish to
 
06:51:43.230 --> 06:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
gather some people together that becomes
 
06:51:45.948 --> 06:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
a work group and it has to be noticed in
 
06:51:48.548 --> 06:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
the calendar uh it has to be gotten to
 
06:51:51.110 --> 06:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
me to get into the calendar to have a
 
06:51:53.190 --> 06:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
room set aside for that you may do that
 
06:51:55.788 --> 06:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
if you wish but uh those are the
 
06:51:58.948 --> 06:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
parameters of what we have with this but
 
06:52:01.948 --> 06:52:01.958 align:start position:0%
under the last day this will ever be
 
06:52:04.310 --> 06:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
looked at by US unless you want to do
 
06:52:06.948 --> 06:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
interm study is February 13th
 
06:52:09.190 --> 06:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford uh thank you Mr
 
06:52:12.590 --> 06:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um we have another similar Bill
 
06:52:14.990 --> 06:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
coming up at the same time next week
 
06:52:17.670 --> 06:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
right and it would be best if we didn't
 
06:52:20.310 --> 06:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
send two bills with the same thing right
 
06:52:23.510 --> 06:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
forward so I am certainly open to trying
 
06:52:27.430 --> 06:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
to marry them together into one bill
 
06:52:29.030 --> 06:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter to me who the sponsor is
 
06:52:31.190 --> 06:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
as long as it moves
 
06:52:33.590 --> 06:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
forward Okay let's listen to the next
 
06:52:36.110 --> 06:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
one next week and see what we want to do
 
06:52:38.990 --> 06:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
after that and along the way to that we
 
06:52:40.070 --> 06:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
have two more people because there are
 
06:52:41.868 --> 06:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
some good things in it I think that we
 
06:52:45.830 --> 06:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
could use yeah I mean chair recognizes
 
06:52:47.510 --> 06:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Robert
 
06:52:50.070 --> 06:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
tangue who asked for three minutes and
 
06:52:51.788 --> 06:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you five minutes and
 
06:52:57.750 --> 06:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:00.548 --> 06:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
sir that means I got to find my
 
06:53:04.510 --> 06:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
watch okay you remember you
 
06:53:08.990 --> 06:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:12.510 --> 06:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
side when you when you turn these in you
 
06:53:14.788 --> 06:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
should have the bill number on it so it
 
06:53:17.430 --> 06:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't get lost in the it'll be okay
 
06:53:19.430 --> 06:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
it'll be
 
06:53:19.440 --> 06:53:21.750 align:start position:0%
it'll be
okay

06:53:21.750 --> 06:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:53:21.760 --> 06:53:32.468 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

06:53:32.468 --> 06:53:32.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:51.670 --> 06:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:51.680 --> 06:53:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:53:55.830 --> 06:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:57.708 --> 06:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
well he's getting ready to do that so it
 
06:53:59.670 --> 06:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't count against his time I think
 
06:54:03.070 --> 06:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
the clerk might like to have somebody
 
06:54:07.150 --> 06:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
help her with this pile of stuff here so
 
06:54:09.468 --> 06:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
we can make packets for the
 
06:54:12.350 --> 06:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
representatives who weren't here patrino
 
06:54:14.990 --> 06:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
and LC um if somebody would be willing
 
06:54:16.190 --> 06:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
to do it it'll probably take you about
 
06:54:19.670 --> 06:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
10 minutes sprawl it all out also I want
 
06:54:24.670 --> 06:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
to uh uh make sure that I get a blur but
 
06:54:27.670 --> 06:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
committee report on 1588 from
 
06:54:27.680 --> 06:54:30.468 align:start position:0%
committee report on 1588 from
representative

06:54:30.468 --> 06:54:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:33.990 --> 06:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:36.548 --> 06:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
whom on me my
 
06:54:38.868 --> 06:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
desk oh it needs to come to me for
 
06:54:42.350 --> 06:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
approval first okay and also eventually
 
06:54:45.910 --> 06:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative ball in 1598 so if we can
 
06:54:45.920 --> 06:54:48.948 align:start position:0%
representative ball in 1598 so if we can
find

06:54:48.948 --> 06:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:51.590 --> 06:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm asking for her
 
06:54:55.708 --> 06:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
blurb on 1588 it has to go to me first
 
06:54:59.110 --> 06:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
for approval I'm just
 
06:55:02.388 --> 06:55:02.398 align:start position:0%
okay I know we're remembering the ways
 
06:55:04.590 --> 06:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
to do it that's
 
06:55:08.190 --> 06:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
okay okay are you ready I am rock and
 
06:55:10.590 --> 06:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
roll okay um so what I just passed
 
06:55:12.948 --> 06:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
around was this uh document right here
 
06:55:15.190 --> 06:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
here's a picture of me from my LinkedIn
 
06:55:18.670 --> 06:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
profile um with a note and uh it's
 
06:55:21.708 --> 06:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
basically just to show the contention um
 
06:55:24.590 --> 06:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
that comes into play with family court
 
06:55:27.070 --> 06:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
matters and a lot of it's over money and
 
06:55:30.548 --> 06:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
financial resources and basically child
 
06:55:33.310 --> 06:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
support is a big candy bucket that gets
 
06:55:36.948 --> 06:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
awarded to one party and it's typically
 
06:55:40.230 --> 06:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
the party that
 
06:55:42.708 --> 06:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
um has the
 
06:55:44.948 --> 06:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
kids and when
 
06:55:49.110 --> 06:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's assumed to be uh typically a
 
06:55:53.388 --> 06:55:53.398 align:start position:0%
mother um that is part of what goes
 
06:55:53.398 --> 06:55:55.388 align:start position:0%
mother um that is part of what goes
into

06:55:55.388 --> 06:55:55.398 align:start position:0%
into
 
06:55:55.398 --> 06:55:57.430 align:start position:0%
into
basically

06:55:57.430 --> 06:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
basically
 
06:56:00.788 --> 06:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
um causing families to break up breaking
 
06:56:03.388 --> 06:56:03.398 align:start position:0%
up a family is a big deal it's it's such
 
06:56:07.150 --> 06:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
a big deal that it's it's been shown in
 
06:56:10.708 --> 06:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
um the child's uh the uh title 4D grant
 
06:56:13.750 --> 06:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
money uh and it's taken very lightly now
 
06:56:18.868 --> 06:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:21.468 --> 06:56:21.478 align:start position:0%

06:56:48.788 --> 06:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
think that that's necessary to get it
 
06:56:51.388 --> 06:56:51.398 align:start position:0%
from you so
 
06:56:51.398 --> 06:56:52.910 align:start position:0%
from you so
much

06:56:52.910 --> 06:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:56:55.230 --> 06:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
M we suspend for a minute point of order
 
06:56:57.230 --> 06:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I don't feel like this
 
06:56:58.948 --> 06:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
has anything to do with the
 
06:57:02.628 --> 06:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
bill we need to speak directly to the
 
06:57:06.590 --> 06:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill not to the global issue uh of child
 
06:57:10.030 --> 06:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
support this is based on adjusting the
 
06:57:10.040 --> 06:57:12.030 align:start position:0%
support this is based on adjusting the
support

06:57:12.030 --> 06:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:57:14.670 --> 06:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines so so what happened you can
 
06:57:16.388 --> 06:57:16.398 align:start position:0%
hit your mic back on again please thank
 
06:57:20.388 --> 06:57:20.398 align:start position:0%
you I apologize um so what happens so
 
06:57:23.388 --> 06:57:23.398 align:start position:0%
that's on October 31st first what
 
06:57:27.708 --> 06:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
happens is when someone decides to end a
 
06:57:31.150 --> 06:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
relationship it's always one person one
 
06:57:32.990 --> 06:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
person decides to end a relationship and
 
06:57:36.310 --> 06:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
break up a family and they do that
 
06:57:38.548 --> 06:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
assuming that they will get the
 
06:57:42.388 --> 06:57:42.398 align:start position:0%
kids and get the child support money and
 
06:57:45.070 --> 06:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
um if you listen to that audio that
 
06:57:48.350 --> 06:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
audio before the point of order was um
 
06:57:50.270 --> 06:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
it was describing that the domestic
 
06:57:52.788 --> 06:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
violence Coalition had a picture and
 
06:57:55.670 --> 06:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
they actually sent a picture to the what
 
06:57:57.708 --> 06:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
you're looking at is a picture of me
 
06:57:59.670 --> 06:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
with some criminal defamation and a
 
06:58:02.270 --> 06:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
letter uh for me to describe that how I
 
06:58:04.070 --> 06:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
got that at the governor's office all
 
06:58:06.910 --> 06:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
those videos are on there so I do
 
06:58:12.030 --> 06:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
support this bill um as as giving a
 
06:58:16.868 --> 06:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
reason uh to
 
06:58:19.468 --> 06:58:19.478 align:start position:0%
guide as amount the amount of time that
 
06:58:23.628 --> 06:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
you have with someone instead of just
 
06:58:23.638 --> 06:58:25.910 align:start position:0%
you have with someone instead of just
uh

06:58:25.910 --> 06:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:58:28.150 --> 06:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
having a
 
06:58:28.160 --> 06:58:29.788 align:start position:0%
having a
financial

06:58:29.788 --> 06:58:29.798 align:start position:0%
financial
 
06:58:33.548 --> 06:58:33.558 align:start position:0%
incentive uh to not work as you heard
 
06:58:37.270 --> 06:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
previous gentleman stated he he works
 
06:58:39.628 --> 06:58:39.638 align:start position:0%
full-time he makes he makes money and
 
06:58:41.868 --> 06:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
then the partner will choose not to work
 
06:58:44.468 --> 06:58:44.478 align:start position:0%
so their income goes down they get money
 
06:58:46.150 --> 06:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that should be adjusted by the
 
06:58:48.270 --> 06:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
actual costs of time and and money
 
06:58:50.590 --> 06:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
raring uh this bill doesn't solve
 
06:58:53.990 --> 06:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
everything um but elves a lot and so and
 
06:58:56.270 --> 06:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to speak um a little bit
 
06:58:58.708 --> 06:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
more about as I brought up in a previous
 
06:59:02.468 --> 06:59:02.478 align:start position:0%
bill um 1955 the uniform support act
 
06:59:06.190 --> 06:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
came out we codified it in laws RSA
 
06:59:09.110 --> 06:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
546 um I do recommend that we do put
 
06:59:10.310 --> 06:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
that if you guys are going to talk about
 
06:59:12.190 --> 06:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
this more put that on the financial
 
06:59:16.670 --> 06:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines worksheet RSA 546 A5 when
 
06:59:18.230 --> 06:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
determining the amount due for child
 
06:59:20.750 --> 06:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
support the court shall consider all
 
06:59:23.190 --> 06:59:23.200 align:start position:0%

06:59:36.628 --> 06:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
the party is responsibility of the
 
06:59:38.868 --> 06:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
obligor for the support of others if
 
06:59:41.110 --> 06:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
they have other children we've made
 
06:59:43.830 --> 06:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
these laws if you read the laws they go
 
06:59:46.910 --> 06:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
back in time they make sense lots of
 
06:59:49.310 --> 06:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
people had to work on them vote on them
 
06:59:51.590 --> 06:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
and discuss them before they came out
 
06:59:53.270 --> 06:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
all the way back back to the Inception
 
06:59:56.708 --> 06:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
of RSA 461 parental rights and
 
06:59:59.310 --> 06:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh there's a lot of
 
07:00:01.590 --> 07:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
contention when you hear lawyers speak
 
07:00:04.070 --> 07:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
and testify they make a lot of money the
 
07:00:07.190 --> 07:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
more contention the more money they make
 
07:00:10.230 --> 07:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
and they use that and you can see it in
 
07:00:12.708 --> 07:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
my case specific I can show all those
 
07:00:14.708 --> 07:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
details and I've brought them all to the
 
07:00:16.910 --> 07:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
people's attention yeah got one minute
 
07:00:20.910 --> 07:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
and 20 seconds to go sounds good so it
 
07:00:26.150 --> 07:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's important RSA 546 1945 uh 56 sorry
 
07:00:30.468 --> 07:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
55 uniform support act there are special
 
07:00:32.670 --> 07:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances where they can deviate
 
07:00:35.430 --> 07:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
from that however they're hidden and
 
07:00:37.750 --> 07:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
they should be put on the form with the
 
07:00:41.230 --> 07:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
child guidelines worksheet also uh RSA
 
07:00:41.240 --> 07:00:42.750 align:start position:0%
child guidelines worksheet also uh RSA
458

07:00:42.750 --> 07:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
458
 
07:00:46.548 --> 07:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
C which is currently in law requires
 
07:00:48.628 --> 07:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
that the person seeking child support
 
07:00:51.270 --> 07:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
shall file a child guidelines worksheet
 
07:00:53.310 --> 07:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
they did not do that in my case yet the
 
07:00:56.110 --> 07:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
judge ordered child support to generate
 
07:01:00.910 --> 07:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
a rear ages and um you know the point is
 
07:01:00.920 --> 07:01:02.190 align:start position:0%
a rear ages and um you know the point is
is

07:01:02.190 --> 07:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:01:05.708 --> 07:01:05.718 align:start position:0%
judges lie in New Hampshire lawyers lie
 
07:01:07.868 --> 07:01:07.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and nobody does
 
07:01:10.468 --> 07:01:10.478 align:start position:0%
anything about it and if we are able to
 
07:01:13.230 --> 07:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
pass a bill which I do support this bill
 
07:01:17.388 --> 07:01:17.398 align:start position:0%
uh to remove the candy bowl from uh the
 
07:01:19.468 --> 07:01:19.478 align:start position:0%
person who is ending a relationship and
 
07:01:21.350 --> 07:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
breaking up a family I think that is a
 
07:01:24.030 --> 07:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
good thing thank you so much on time
 
07:01:28.030 --> 07:01:28.040 align:start position:0%

afraid it was going to be all about
 
07:01:39.510 --> 07:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
numbers and columns and things but that
 
07:01:42.230 --> 07:01:42.240 align:start position:0%

07:02:03.510 --> 07:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:06.788 --> 07:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
it so hello my name is Greg Lombardo I'm
 
07:02:10.230 --> 07:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
in favor of this house bill um 1595 I
 
07:02:11.948 --> 07:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
have a similar scenario to the guy send
 
07:02:13.350 --> 07:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
him up to my left I forget his name
 
07:02:15.990 --> 07:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but um again I'm a
 
07:02:17.468 --> 07:02:17.478 align:start position:0%
divorced father with two little kids
 
07:02:20.468 --> 07:02:20.478 align:start position:0%
ages four and six I've had 50/50 equal
 
07:02:21.708 --> 07:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
shared parenting since the beginning of
 
07:02:24.430 --> 07:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
my divorce parenting plan established
 
07:02:27.190 --> 07:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
with the 223 equal shared parenting
 
07:02:29.070 --> 07:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
however I'm forced to pay full guideline
 
07:02:31.910 --> 07:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
child support I have the exact same
 
07:02:34.708 --> 07:02:34.718 align:start position:0%
burden of child rearing as the mother
 
07:02:36.830 --> 07:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
does she supplies nothing for the
 
07:02:38.868 --> 07:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
children when they were with me 50% of
 
07:02:41.750 --> 07:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
the time all while she has 100% of the
 
07:02:44.510 --> 07:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
child rearing funds meant for both of us
 
07:02:49.868 --> 07:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:52.270 --> 07:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
have we need some sort of syst system
 
07:02:55.110 --> 07:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
that provides and allows both parents to
 
07:02:56.910 --> 07:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
have equal or approximate equal
 
07:02:58.948 --> 07:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
parenting time to have proportional
 
07:03:01.830 --> 07:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
income to do so having the lower earning
 
07:03:03.868 --> 07:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
parent end up with 100% of the funds for
 
07:03:06.150 --> 07:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
child rearing does not make sense with
 
07:03:10.150 --> 07:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
the kids um when the kids are provided
 
07:03:11.708 --> 07:03:11.718 align:start position:0%
for and taken care of equally or
 
07:03:14.548 --> 07:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
approximately equal by both parents
 
07:03:16.990 --> 07:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's it all good thank you so much any
 
07:03:17.000 --> 07:03:18.750 align:start position:0%
that's it all good thank you so much any
questions

07:03:18.750 --> 07:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:03:21.110 --> 07:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
anybody representative long has a
 
07:03:23.830 --> 07:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
07:03:26.670 --> 07:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Lombardo uh could you could
 
07:03:28.468 --> 07:03:28.478 align:start position:0%
you give me a brief look at what your
 
07:03:31.548 --> 07:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
5050 parenting time is is is it
 
07:03:35.590 --> 07:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
overnight 5050 is it actual time it's
 
07:03:38.670 --> 07:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
actual time 5050 um so it's called what
 
07:03:41.510 --> 07:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
I people call it is a 223 so it rotates
 
07:03:43.430 --> 07:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
every other week so basically every two
 
07:03:45.150 --> 07:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
days we swap and we have every other
 
07:03:48.510 --> 07:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
weekend we swap so I have them the exact
 
07:03:52.070 --> 07:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
same time that the mother does okay and
 
07:03:54.468 --> 07:03:54.478 align:start position:0%
uh follow up if I make yes the higher
 
07:03:56.670 --> 07:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
earner is I'm the higher earner you're
 
07:04:00.430 --> 07:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:02.990 --> 07:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
you sing none thank you so much for your

whether we want to exact this bill or
 
07:05:06.350 --> 07:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
not do we want to do that or do we want
 
07:05:08.750 --> 07:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
to ponder it and have some amendments
 
07:05:14.150 --> 07:05:14.160 align:start position:0%

07:05:37.510 --> 07:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
to decide whether we want to move to
 
07:05:40.750 --> 07:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
execu or not if we don't do it today it
 
07:05:43.070 --> 07:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
