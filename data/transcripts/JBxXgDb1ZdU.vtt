[Music]

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
address happens se one is making
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the definition that changed
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%

00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
25 that has become problem
 
00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:01.079 align:start position:0%

what this amendment proposes to do is
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
leave that number up to 30 for dos this
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
hear you very
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
well that's much better thank you I'm
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
sorry about that so the uh the 30 dogs
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
we move the number up to 30 dogs and we
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
move the Caps up to
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
35 and then
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh the next part that is changed in that
 
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
the uh that the amendment would change
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
is moving the reporting date from
 
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
January 1 to December 31st excuse me
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
yeah the transfer date from January 1 to
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
December 31st and it would keep the
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
registration date at the current uh July
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
1 to June 30th this was done on the
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
request of the commissioner because he's
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
having uh issues with those two dates
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
happening at the same time so he is
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
going to come on and testify after me
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
and I'll let him discuss uh the
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
reasoning for
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
that the second part of the bill deals
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
with an exemption that would allow
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
a breeder who has not qualified to be a
 
00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
pet vendor for the last four 12 months
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
periods or four years to apply for an
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
exemption if they found themselves in a
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
situation where they had a two letters
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
that say they had eight animals or nine
 
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
animals and then all of a sudden the
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
third litter they were breeding they
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
thought they'd be safely under the
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
number and all of a sudden they have a a
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
a litter of 15 you know types of things
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
do happen and so this would give them an
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to apply for an exemption
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
because theoretically what would happen
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
is if they exceed that threshold they
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
would then have to qualify as a pet
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
vendor and they're looking to transfer
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
these animals you know these dogs per
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
say let's use that for an example in
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
roughly 8 to 10 weeks and it would be
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
near impossible for them to get through
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
all the Hoops to become a pet V this
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
would allow them an opportunity to go to
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and ask for this
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
exemption and say uh you know we we have
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
this situ situation that occurred and we
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
realize we're going to be over and and
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
we meet the criteria there's two
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
specific criteria and I'll read uh
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
number one person has transferred fewer
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
than 30 dogs or 35 cats annually in the
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
previous 412 months period beginning
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
January 1 through December
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
31st the second is the person has not
 
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
been required to register as a pet
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
vendor in the previous 4 12 months
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
period beginning January 1 through the
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.150 align:start position:0%
period beginning January 1 through the
following

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh December
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
31st so those are important those are
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
two important points because this is a
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
pretty narrow exemption and and they
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
have to be make sure that they have not
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
exceeded you know and been qualified to
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
be a pet fendor or they would not be
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
able to seek this
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
exemption the uh next thing that happens
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
is the commissioner should make a
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
determination on such exemption within
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
15 days of its submission such such
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
exemption shall expire on December 3rd
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
first fing its issuance again another
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
point this isn't allowed to be a is
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
meant to be a management tool for a
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
breeder it's meant to if they get into a
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
situation that they have found
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
themselves in where they had this
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
exceptionally High litter that they
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
could apply for this once every four
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
years and by expiring it does not allow
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
them to continue on into the next year
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
they go back to the original
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
WS Point uh C is a person exempt from
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
lure as a pet vendor under this
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
paragraph May transfer no more than 15
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
dogs or 15 cats in addition to the 30
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
dog or 35 cat women in sub paragraph a
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
within the period and his or her
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
exemption is valid so we've not only
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
given very narrow reasons of you know
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
we've narrowed the exceptions as to why
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
they can get I mean the criteria why
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
they can get the exception there was
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
also a threshold limit on the top that
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
exceed the last portion action three of
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
the bill is dealing with a zoning issue
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
that has occurred during the uh language
 
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:37.290 align:start position:0%
that was put in in the
 
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
that was put in in the
[Music]

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.189 align:start position:0%
[Music]
20

00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
18 but so one of the things that's
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
occurring is there was a zoning
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
requirement that was placed in
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
previously to that zoning requirement
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
any animals uh any pet vendor that was
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh transferring 50 or more animals had
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
had to apply comply with some zoning
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
this moved it down to 25 what this did
 
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
is it really scooped into that net a a
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
bunch of very small breeders that now
 
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden are faced with having to
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
go to their zoning boards and make sure
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
that they are in compliance with zoning
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
to have that you know breeding three
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
letters that many of them do right in
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
their own home and so that became
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
problematic so what action three of this
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
bill would do was it would just simply
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
move that number back to the 50 trans of
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
dogs or cats or ferrets or birds in
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
order to comply with the zoning
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
requirements this would put it back to
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
where they were prior to 2018 as far as
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
just as far as the zoning portion
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
home if they uh you know they still
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
would have to try to be a pet vendor at
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
30 dogs or 35 cats but they wouldn't
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
trigger the zoning thing until they get
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
up to 50 so that so what that does is it
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
allows these home breeders who are very
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
small in nature and again often doing
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
this in their home would allow them not
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
to have have to get into that whole
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
zoning nightmare that some of them have
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
been really
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
struggling I think that're pretty well
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
describes what's going on uh what the
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
bill does uh guess I will open up to
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions Madam P if there are any from
 
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:23.910 align:start position:0%
questions Madam P if there are any from
the

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
committee I have a question from
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
yep hi thank you um sh um
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
chairwoman um thank you for taking my
 
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
question representative Pearl I did have
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
a question on page two line two of the
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
amendment um it reads that such an
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
exemption shall expire on the December
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
31st following its issuance just a small
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
grammatical thing is that how it is
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
read I'm sorry can you speak louder yeah
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes I was saying on page two line two of
 
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:05.959 align:start position:0%
the amendment it reads such an exemption
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
Sal it shall expire on the December 31st
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
following the issuance and I was just
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
curious if that's how it intended to
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
something I guess it it uh could be
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
changed I mean it it may be technically
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
grammatic wrong but that is the way that
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
OSS recommended agree but I will
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:43.450 align:start position:0%
you let see who

you let see who

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
else oh I'm sorry um representative Bal
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do you know
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
whether anyone has gone over the2 or
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
25 yes I would ask you to direct that
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
question to the commission when he
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
testifies I believe so but he'll have
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
would if that is the case would this not
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
help them for another four years then or
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
language

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
so if this passes as written if they've
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
had to qualify or they have been
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
registered as a pet vendor then they
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
will have four years before they seek
 
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:45.470 align:start position:0%
will have four years before they seek
the

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
exemption oh I'm sorry representative H
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:07.870 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
the new amendment is here that was the
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
one change it's the original Amendment
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
error

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
Dy uh yes I just want to make the
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
comment that when the speakers in the
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee room move even slightly away
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
microphone uh we can't hear you you
 
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
become very garbled so although I could
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
understand representative Pearl's
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
answers I couldn't understand the
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
question so um I don't know if that if
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's a way to rectify it but from my
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
perspective it appears that when you
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
move your face away from the
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
microphone uh it becomes
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
garbled thank you representative we've
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
got uh multi- Correctional mics for the
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
remainder of the folks here and we'll
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
have to have them move closer to them
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
when they're asking questions thank you
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
that representative comp thank
 
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
you is it possible for repres
 
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.710 align:start position:0%
you is it possible for repres
to

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
question sure representative Balden '
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
been requested to ask your question
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
call um so my questions were um do you
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
know whether anyone has gone over the 25
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
dogs since these numbers went from 50 to
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
25 and the follow question was would
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
this bill therefore enough help them for
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
another four years then would there be a
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
grand was everybody able to hear that
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
did answer that again representative
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
Pearl sure if you'd like me
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
to so I on the first part of the
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
question I'd asked that he defer that to
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner as he's going to
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
testify next and he'll have better info
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
on that than I do and the second part of
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
the question is uh as written if the uh
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
person seeking exception had
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
um qualified to be a pet vendor or
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
registered to be a pet limited then it
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
would be four years before they could
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:08.919 align:start position:0%
exception thank you very much um now I
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
believe that um commissioner Jasper has
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:23.390 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
so waiting to be unmuted all right can
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
you hear me now yes good morning thank
 
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
you sorry for that delay this is a
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
strange new world to me as I'm sure it
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
is to all of you as
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
well um so the couple questions here um
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
that I've heard in the first is I don't
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually know how many new pet vendors
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:22:50.919 --> 00:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
we have
registered

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
registered
 
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.149 align:start position:0%
registered
uh

00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
yes wait a minute I've got an email back
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
veterinarian um and if you give me a
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
moment to get to my email I can give you
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:21.950 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
yeah oh sorry about
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
that when the threshold was 50
 
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
um we had five about five license
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
breeders currently we have 15 licensed
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
breeders this is obviously just uh for
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
dogs we don't have total number of pet
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
vendors but obviously the number has
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
gone up for breeders
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
substantially uh relative to the the
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
date difference here we we actually
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
realized IED in the process uh last year
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
that having both dates be um running
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
from January or rather from uh July 1st
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
through June 30th created a problem for
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
us in that if somebody was to be
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
licensed we might not have the complete
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
uh data Available To Us by the licensing
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
date and um because we do have a small
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
staff it also created some problems
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
without the database particularly of
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
trying to bring all those numbers
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
together and and see where we were so
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
this gives us that six-month window
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
which makes a lot of sense um to us to
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
to be able to um look forward as we move
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
into the licensing
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
year uh not sure if I recall any other
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
questions in there but I'll be glad to
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.470 align:start position:0%
 
have

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
see any questions from the
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
comme representative
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
viby yes um I was wondering if uh the
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
fact that the submission of the um uh
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
Health certificates is currently listed
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
as optional as creating an impediment to
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
knowing who you should actually be
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
licensing well obviously that's not the
 
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
best um way to do we currently request
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
them if we think there may be um
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
somebody who's transferring more
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
than uh than the limit however the
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
problem as you learned last week um is
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we don't have the ability to take
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
those 880,000 documents and and properly
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
um deal with them anyhow and so you know
 
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
until we have the database up and
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
running um you know there's just no way
 
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to catch them all I when the
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
number of uh animals increased a couple
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
of years ago we informed the house and
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate that uh you know we would not
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
be able to to comply with this at 100%
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing the best that we can we only
 
00:26:24.909 --> 00:26:24.919 align:start position:0%
received one new employee and um we're
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
we're putting well more than one
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
full-time position into this effort
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
right now as it is so as Dr Crawford
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
told you last week you know it's sort of
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
what what is the priority of of the day
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
so um you know we the
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
legislature and put the cart before the
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
horse if you will we're going to
 
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
continue to try to get that horse back
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
in front of the cart but it is going to
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
be a number of years before the the
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
horse is in front of the cart um so
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing the best we can but we are
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
not going to catch
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
everybody uh it's going to be somewhat
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
by happens sometimes it's people
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
reporting that um people are trans
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
transferring animals we didn't know
 
00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
about we look into it sometimes it's
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
local law
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement um and sometimes we happen
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
to to catch them because a veterinarian
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
may send in a number of um certificates
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
but you know it's it's sort of just a a
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
crapshoot right now and it will continue
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
to be in all frankness I mean we just do
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
not have the
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
Personnel um to be able to to deal with
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
this and so you know the going from 25
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
um back up to 30 probably won't make
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
much difference for us will certainly
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
make a difference for some people but um
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it'll take any of those
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
readers out of the U out of the
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
definition right now or not but um
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
you know we're constantly dealing with
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
issues this morning I
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
just um reviewed two letters of fines
 
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
going out to two different uh pet
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
vendors one because hasn't bothered to
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh renew his license and the other um
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
for you know essentially health issues
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
within the store and sanitary issues and
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
so those are things we're we're
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
constantly trying to deal with but not
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
going to uh not going to get there
 
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.830 align:start position:0%
going to uh not going to get there
anytime

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
sure my question is for commissioner
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
Jasper with the six months with that six
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
Monon window um with a person that
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
qualifies by December
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
31st but would they not get licensed
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
1st you know I don't know if Dr Crawford
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
is on or not um I think that anybody can
 
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
get licensed at any time during the
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
licensing period their license would
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
then get get renewed I believe on July
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
31st on July 1st so um I don't I don't
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
think that creates any any type of a a
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
problem I think we license people as as
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
they ask to be licensed we don't make
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
somebody came in in August we wouldn't
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
say too bad you've missed the window I
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
think it would just be a matter of their
 
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:43.519 align:start position:0%
license would run for you know 10 or 11
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
months instead of a full year on that
 
00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:47.630 align:start position:0%
months instead of a full year on that
first

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
year thank you commissioner Jasper
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
um Mr Crawford is on would you like him
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
to answer that at this time I would like
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
him to just to make sure that I didn't
 
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
give you some bad information okay go
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
ahead Mr C Dr C I'm sorry no worry can
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
me can I got a couple thumbs up um
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner's correct I get sort of a
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
yes the commissioner is correct
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
uh you can get license at any point
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
during the year you don't have to wait
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
to an for a new
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
license I'm sorry would you repeat that
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear that well sure I'm trying
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
to get closer to my my computer here um
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
so the commissioner was correct you can
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
get Li anyone can get licensed at any
 
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
point during the licensing year uh
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's not an obligation and we don't
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
make people wait until a new licensing
 
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
year to get licensed so someone who
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
applied in December could get licensed
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
in December and then that license would
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
be good through the June 30th expiration
 
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
of that licensing
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
year thank you very much for
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.710 align:start position:0%
year thank you very much for
that

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
next I guess we have Angela Ferrari from
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
testify good
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
morning good morning can you hear me I
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
can hear you fine wonderful um hello
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
everybody and thank you for the time to
 
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
speak today my name is Angela Ferrari
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
and I am with the dog owners of the
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
Granite State and I just wanted to touch
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
on a few points um over this bill and I
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative Pearl for
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
doing a really great job explaining all
 
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
of the different aspects of the bill so
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully I can keep this nice and short
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned this bill is due to
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2019 that was passed
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
without getting to go through both the
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate um and it was put
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
into the budget so there was not a lot
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
of opportunity for public comment on
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill and my group dog owners of the
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
granite state has always been very
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
opposed to the original version of the
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
bill um we feel hb250 takes steps in the
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
right direction to address many of the
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
issues um that we had with the original
 
00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
Bill primarily it was the reduction in
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
the threshold by 50% from what was
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
originally in law prior to that 2019
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
bill um which which is a really a big
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
jump from being licensed for breeders of
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
dogs and cats um a little bit of history
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
on litter sizes for some of you who
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
maybe haven't um been on the committee
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
in Prior years um a dog can have
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere from one puppy to upwards of 12
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
being more consistent on the large end
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
but there have been cases of 15 to 20
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
puppies in the single Le litter so this
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
speaks a little bit to the exemption
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned where a breeder may
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
have a couple standard size litters
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
think that they have the ability to have
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
one more litter without going over that
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
have

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.070 align:start position:0%
have
hang

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
on I got cut off Midstream and getting
 
00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:37.549 align:start position:0%
on I got cut off Midstream and getting
that

00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
fixed oh sorry I think I got muted again
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
sorry um not sure what the last piece
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
you heard was but essentially I was just
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
saying that final litter could really
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
put them over the threshold and require
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
them to become licensed as a pet vendor
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
um there isn't necessarily anything
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
wrong wrong with becoming licensed as a
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
pet vendor but a lot of small hobby
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
breeders do try and avoid additional
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
fees such as licensing that would be
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
required um they are protective of their
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
homes and disease that can be brought in
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
by anyone from the outside coming in
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
such as during an
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
inspection um they also you know don't
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
like to be added to public lists where
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
animal rights activists could
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:27.389 align:start position:0%
animal rights activists could
potentially

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
um Target them for any reason and so
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
there's just some reasons that they like
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
to not become pet vendors commercial
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
breeders whatever it may be called it
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
isn't a business for the majority of
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
these people it's it's a hobby and a
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
passion um example for myself I do breed
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
doberman's but I have a full-time job
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
that's really just what I do on the
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
weekends and I show my dogs and things
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
like that so just a little bit of
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
background there um the exemption would
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
give the opportunity for that kind of
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
one fluke incident where a breeder does
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
go over the limit to get evaluated by
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture so that
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
they can look to see no they haven't
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
gone over in the last four years they
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
really don't seem to be somebody that we
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
should force to become a pet vendor at
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
this time we'll grant them this
 
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
exemption for this one
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
year um there is a little bit of
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
confusion and I don't know maybe at the
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
end commissioner Jasper can comment on
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
this um regarding the timing I know we
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
talked about at any time you can submit
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
to become a pet vendor um if you are a
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
pet vendor and you're waiting to get a
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
renewal and they're counting through
 
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
December 31st there is a six-month
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
period where I guess you would still be
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
considered a pet vendor but you haven't
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
got your renewal yet and so just want to
 
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
clarify that there isn't any concern
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
with anyone not being able to continue
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
to transfer animals during that time um
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
so maybe at the end he can comment on
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
that going back to the points of the
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh with the increase in dogs and
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
cats to 30 and 35 as in the latest
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment um it's still a 35 to 40% drop
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
from the pre 2019 numbers but we feel is
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit more reasonable and gives a
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more flexibility for those
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
small hobby breeders to just have a
 
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
little bit of room before they do end up
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
becoming pet vendors which essentially
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
commercial um
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
license the biggest part of this bill
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
that I really really like is the
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the municipal Zone in
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
Conformity requirements because that is
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
a really huge aspect to becoming a pet
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
vendor in current law even at um the 25
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
puppies for example you cannot become a
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
pet vendor without Municipal zoning
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
Conformity which requires you to
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
complete a form bring it to your town
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
likely you're going to have to go to a
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
town board meeting and essentially
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
you're asking to become a commercial
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
entity within your town and that may not
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
be approved in many towns not only that
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
the people your ab Butters around you
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
have to often provide approval as well
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
and when it sounds like you want to
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
become a pet vendor or a commercial
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
kennel type entity um that is very
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
concerning to a lot of people because it
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're going to have
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dogs barking and become
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
something that you're not when they
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
don't even realize that for many years
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
you've been practicing this hobby from
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
your home um your
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
residence so we have actually had a
 
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
number of people in our community who
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
have been unable to attain that zoning
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
Conformity from their town and that
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
makes them unable to obtain the pet
 
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
vendor license which means they're not
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
able to continue to have puppies to
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
transfer um and continue their hobby so
 
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.030 align:start position:0%
transfer um and continue their hobby so
essentially

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
it really the license application really
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
is uh resulting in some violations of
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
due process for those who you know have
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
been doing this out of their residence
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
um All This Time by increasing the
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
threshold for the Zone in Conformity
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
back to our pre 20109 numbers of the 50
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
transfers it really just gives a little
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
bit of flexibility to those who want to
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
continue to operate out of their homes
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I want everyone to to keep in mind
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
that these puppies that are being raised
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
in homes and kittens as well those are
 
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
animals that are growing up in such a
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful environment who our New
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents can buy to bring
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
into their homes and I don't think it's
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
something that we want to lose those are
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
really special breeders and
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
preservationists of breeds um who are
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
rais in puppies in that type of
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
environment versus those who are coming
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
from you know kennels and they're not
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
having that home experience so I think
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
it's really important that
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
we help those type of breeders continue
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
to do what they're doing so that we can
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
continue to have those Health tested
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
genetic tested uh working trait tested
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
animals available to our residents um
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
and not push them out of existence by
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
really tight laws so hb250 helps us go
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
in the right direction to fix some of
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
the problems that came up in
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
2019 um and last year this committee did
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
favorably vote ought to pass on a
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
similar version of this bill that just
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to make its way further due
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
to the covid pandemic so I hope you will
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
all consider doing that again this year
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to take any
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you you is Ferrari uh
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
and we have a question from
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby sure yes thank you
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh Miss Farrari um I
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could explain why
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
transferring animals is important for a
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
breeder thank you for the question I
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
would be happy to um I'll use myself as
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
an example the reason that I even breed
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
any of my my dogs is because I'm trying
 
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
to always produce an animal Better Than
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
Better Health better temperament better
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
working ability for whatever it is that
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
I may be doing with my dogs um so that I
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
can continue to produce the Doberman for
 
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
the people who love that breed as much
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
as I do the other reason I do it is
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
because I do like to compete
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
um in confirmation shows with my dogs um
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
I have people who do agility scent work
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
different activities with their dogs um
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
and for me to be able
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
to use the creation from my breeding
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
program um in those shows is really
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
important to me and unfortunately I
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
can't keep every single puppy from every
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
litter because then we would have a
 
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
hoarding situation at my house house and
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
as much as I love every one of them I do
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they end up in
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
fabulous homes and it is actually
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
another a really happy time um when I
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
get to see my puppies go off to their
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
new homes and the new families are just
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
ecstatic and the puppies are going to
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
deserve thank you thank you um and now I
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
I see uh commissioner Jasper you have
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
yes and and I'm going to start off by
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
apologizing to uh chairman Pearl I had
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
not seen his his Amendment although I
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
was aware of the issue relative to the
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
zoning and I understand the concern
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
there what I'm I'm going to suggest is
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
that I understand the issue for people
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
who are currently breeding but the way
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
the language is this would sort of
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
continue to to create a conflict perhaps
 
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:01.559 align:start position:0%
with local Zoning for people who are
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
coming into the
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
industry so I would like to suggest that
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps this should be a grandfathering
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
situation and for anybody who had
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
um been transferring animals and that's
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
evident through uh Health certificates
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
prior to the adoption of this to give
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
them the exemption but for people who
 
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to come online and start breeding
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
then I don't think they should have that
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
zoning um exemption it's going to create
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit more work for us
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
here but I but I think that that
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
conflict with local
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
zoning on a continuing basis need not
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
continue I also wanted to correct um Dr
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
Crawford had initially sent me email
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
saying 15 readers he corrected that
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
afterwards but before I
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh I didn't see it before I testified
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
and eight they're currently 18 breeders
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
licensed thank you
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner do we have any other
 
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.150 align:start position:0%
commissioner do we have any other
questions

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
from the uh committee or from any
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
attendees I'd like to ask
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
question I a question
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
Mr on on line number four it says
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh a vendor would be somebody that
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
transfers 30 or more dogs so the magic
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
number would be 29 if they hit 30 vendor
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
question so the your question is at 30
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
and above they become a p vendor yes yes
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
askor my question um it kind of relates
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
to the questions I was asking previously
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking so that the Breeders
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
who got caught up in this whole 25
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
transfer issue can take advantage of the
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
exemption four years I'm wondering if
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
there's something we could do to take a
 
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
steep approach and implement it like U
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
maybe make it one 12 month period
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
affected immediately and then two 12
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
month periods affected in January 2022
 
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
2024 thank you for the question I'll
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
certainly consider that let me uh let me
 
00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
think about that and and I discussed
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
with Dr Crawford and the commissioner
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
how much of a headache this would be for
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
them that that would be my my big
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
concern the more of this St approach
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
that you do I fully understand where
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
you're coming from with it I'm just not
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
positive that it would be able to be
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
implemented without a lot of headaches
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
so so let me have that conversation with
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
them this this bill won't be coming up
 
00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
for EXA for a couple of weeks so we've
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
got a little bit of time we can make
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
tweaks to it as necessary thank you for
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
idea thank you representative Pearl and
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Balden uh do I
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
see any other comments or questions of
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:23.079 align:start position:0%
holes okay is that better there you are
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay sorry got to hit the button F
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
fast enough before it
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
disappears um well my name's Nancy
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
Holmes I'm here today from New Boston
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I've um already
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
written in and said I was in um support
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
of the the bill as amended but I find
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm really confused on one issue um
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
because they've changed the exemption
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
year to run from January to December and
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
the license year runs from July to June
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
what year are you Exempted
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
commission sorry about that yes um you'd
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
be Exempted from the licensing year for
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
the licensing Year we're we're going
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
back um and in counting the previous
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
year but you would be Exempted for that
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
period of July 1st through June June
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
30th of the previous year or the current
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
year I mean the C previous year or the
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
next year I I I have a really I'm sorry
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me I I have a really hard time
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
with the the fact that you can't figure
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
out if you need to be licensed until
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
you've produced the puppies and so it's
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
really hard for me to understand which
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
year you're getting licensed for never
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
mind which year you'd get an exemption
 
00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:56.309 align:start position:0%
mind which year you'd get an exemption
for

00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
let me let me try again if I may thank
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
you so in this let's pretend it's law
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
right now just so I get my ear
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
straight so we would now we're now in
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
January of
 
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
2021 we would know everyone in the state
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
theoretically who had health
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
certificates issued in calendar year 20
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that would tell us that all of those
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
licensed um
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
from July 1st 2021 through June 30th
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
2022 so that would give them and us
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to deal with the
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
exemption because at at that time some
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
point in January we would be able to
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
inform everyone that they would need to
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
be licensed in the coming July and if
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
they had a reason they wanted to be
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
exempt they would have time to make
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
their case submit the application for an
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
exemption we would be able to look at
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
that and make our
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
determination and exempt them at that
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
point or not exempt them for July 1st of
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
21 to June 30th of 22 so it actually
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
gives everybody a lot more time U makes
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more sense to do it that way than
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
minute okay I'm I'm sorry I I I just
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
must be really dense because I don't
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
follow this puppies are normally born
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
spring and fall so you're saying that
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
the number of puppies born between July
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
and December would require you to be
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
licensed um for that year but if you
 
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
didn't meet the criteria but you did
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
come spring now I'm I'm still I'm still
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
totally lost well I
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
I the number of puppies will be counted
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
from January
 
00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
1st through December
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
31st okay and that will allow you to
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
look forward to see if you will need to
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
be licensed as of July 1st of the
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
following year okay so it gives you
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to get your ducks in a
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
row to be able to be licensed and we
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
will be particularly once we have the
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
database we'll be in a situation to let
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
everyone know hey in the coming months
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
you need to either apply for an
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
exemption or become a licensed pet
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
vendor um you know I think that makes
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
more sense than having everybody behind
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
the eightball including
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:55.870 align:start position:0%
the eightball including
us

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much for the for the
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
explanation um it it sounds to me like
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
the licensing is based on past history
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
as opposed to current current year
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
breeding so you might end up being
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
licensed for a year in which you produce
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
no puppies at
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
all that is would be the purpose of
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
having the
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
exemption saying hey we went over but we
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
don't plan on having any in the coming
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
year and we wouldn't require somebody to
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
to be like Ed if they said we're not
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
going to be producing any puppies in
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
22 that's a perfectly reasonable ask at
 
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.069 align:start position:0%
22 that's a perfectly reasonable ask at
that

00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
point okay super thank you so much for
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
being patient with me I figure if I
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
didn't okay thank you Miss Holmes um I
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
have a question from representative
 
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you madam chair um this is
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a question for the commissioner
 
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
or really it's about the commissioner's
 
00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.670 align:start position:0%
or really it's about the commissioner's
comment

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
sure thank you I'm looking at page two
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
line two where it states such extion
 
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
shall expire on the December 31st
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
following its issue from what I heard
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
you just say it sounds like this should
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
probably say um June 30th because that's
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
the licensing 12 month cycle July to
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
toct uh that's very Tech
 
00:53:32.829 --> 00:53:32.839 align:start position:0%
technical so you you may well be
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
correct but I think I'd have to have
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
some more more discussions relative to
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
how that that would actually work
 
00:53:40.559 --> 00:53:42.190 align:start position:0%
how that that would actually work
because

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're I think that may be referring to
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
the exemption being the number of
 
00:53:47.319 --> 00:53:49.510 align:start position:0%
the exemption being the number of
puppies

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
puppies
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
produced and if that's the case then or
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
number of animals if that that's case
 
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
then that that is correct because we're
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
exemption for producing a number of
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
animals over the
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
limit for that 12month period so I think
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
exemption would expire
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
then um but you know it is complicated
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
and have to have probably a little bit
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
deeper con ation about how that would
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
work we'll have to look at that and and
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
represent has a follow it's a follow
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
question for the chair um we're getting
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
into work session territory I'm
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
wondering we have a work session on this
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
bill I feel like there's a lot of
 
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
experts yes sure
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative we're
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
not able to have any work sessions this
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
spring because of that but I I think the
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
point you're making is very easily
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
correctable so we I think we could
 
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
probably deal with that any any
 
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
sidec thank you for bringing it up I I
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
point thank you for that
 
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
representative and representative P you
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
had okay thank you um so we're we're
 
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
over our time here
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
and believe we have everybody's
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions answered
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
and supp
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:40.069 align:start position:0%
 
testify

00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
are oh yes um according to the blue
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
sheet we had five persons who supported
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.870 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we have um House Bill 249 an act
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
relative to animal shelter facilities
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to open this hearing and have
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.109 --> 00:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
you morning thank you madam chair for
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative marac 26 representing DET
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
towns of Lowden Boston Canary Northfield
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
and Ward 3 of Franklin I'm also the
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
chair of the house CNA
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee so 249 is an act relative to
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
animal shelter
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
facilities this is a bill that we had
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
last year and uh the primary driver on
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
the bill we received it was to address
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
an issue that the shelter facilities
 
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
were having in the definition and that
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
is what the First Act of the bill does
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
is it adds the language or
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
to the bill to the current language
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
because the some of the shelters were
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
running into situations where they
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
didn't own their building and they
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
technically didn't comply with the
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
definition of animal shelter facility so
 
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the bill last term the
 
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:43.870 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the bill last term the
uh

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee looked to tighten up some
 
00:57:50.029 --> 00:57:50.039 align:start position:0%
other areas of the uh the animal shelter
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
facility language which is in part two
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
relating to health certificates
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
so uh this language has been been
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the the shelters of New
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they've been in agreement
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
there is one Amendment which is
 
00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.470 align:start position:0%
there is one Amendment which is
amendment

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
available I need one okay all
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
right so that will come into play on the
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
second page of this bill so when
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
reviewing this language with the
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
shelters uh I'll go through the uh the
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
parts of it basically this takes some
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
language that was in rules and codifies
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
it which is uh on the back page but on
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
the on the section five A and B a
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
language that the committee the H Ena
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee reviewed last year and we just
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to add these in to tighten up uh
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
identifying characteristics that
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
shelters had to look for when they were
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
brought an animal in the whole goal was
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if the animal is lost
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
or stolen it ends up in a shelter that
 
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
we can get it back to the right of loner
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
as quickly and as easily as possible so
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's basically what this de is Bill is
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
doing and it works in different areas of
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
437 and
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
436 and talks about identifying tattoos
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
and also about making sure that proof of
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccinations are are done if if
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
they're not able to know whether they've
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
had one
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.470 align:start position:0%
had one
before

00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
section c and d are just renaming A and
 
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
B section e is the new language and if
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
you refer to the amendment that I
 
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.670 align:start position:0%
you refer to the amendment that I
discussed

00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
0058 it was a small issue that the uh
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
shelters had with the language that I
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
proposed and so they asked if we could
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
change it to the language that is in the
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
amendment this makes it able for them to
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
comply with looking at the microchip
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
industry regist I mean for a
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
second the final uh section f it was
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
requested by the shelter industry to put
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
in this language was currently in rules
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to make sure that it was
 
01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.039 align:start position:0%
in statute so that it was clear for the
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
shelters to fall so that was added at
 
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.109 align:start position:0%
shelters to fall so that was added at
their

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
request that is pretty much a summary of
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm going to turn it over I
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:26.029 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:00:28.589 --> 01:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
representative Bix BS you have your hand
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
raised thank you madam chair uh thank
 
01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
you member for taking my question um the
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
um on page um on page one uh the all
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
dogs cats and ferrets shall be
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
vaccinated against rabies um the um one
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
issu one issue I see there and I don't
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
know if that would be covered under RSA
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
436 um or if this would as written
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
create a contradiction but
 
01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
um dogs and cat dogs and ferrets can't
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
be uh vaccinated for rabies before three
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
months of age and cats can't be
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated before two months of age uh
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
and so it's conceivable that there would
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
be some small um number of puppies that
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh were baby ferrets
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
that would uh be available for transfer
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
but we're not of an age where they could
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
be um you know medically given uh
 
01:01:34.829 --> 01:01:34.839 align:start position:0%
medically appropriately given the uh the
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine and I was wondering if uh you
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely thought we had done that but
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
if if there needs to be a change for
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
that then certainly that that wants to
 
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you reprentative
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
Pearl is that provision already
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
indicated in RSA
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
436 I want to check to be sure but I
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
thought it was thank you for the
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
question representative Murray you had a
 
01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
question I do Madam chair thank you for
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh I so with respect
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
to um page two down at
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
the pardon me I'm just trying
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
to um where the amendment talks about um
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 437 colon 8 and
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
quarantining requirements I was just I
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
had gone back to take a look at that RSA
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
and I just wasn't sure if that was
 
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.150 align:start position:0%
and I just wasn't sure if that was
referring

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
referring
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
to being held for 48 hours is that I'm
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
looking specifically at section 4 as
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
referenced and I just want I wasn't
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
clear if that was the quarantine that
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
was being referenced or maybe that's a
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
veterinarian thank you for the
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
question don't have 4378 in front of me
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
but I believe it refers to the 48 hours
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
if my
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.279 --> 01:03:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
any we did
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
have Angela Ferrari who wanted to
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
SP so Angela Ferrari go right ahead all
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
right can you hear me now hear you yep
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
perfect uh thank you again for giving me
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
a few minutes to speak um I just I want
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
to provide support for two points on
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't think I've seen the
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
latest Amendment so I would like to take
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
a look at that um but overall I think
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill dog owners of the
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
Granite State supports it we don't see
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
any issue with animal shelter facilities
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
being a able to operate their business
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
in a leased property um so we think that
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
that is a fine addition and then as far
 
01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.910 align:start position:0%
that is a fine addition and then as far
as

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:04:42.029 --> 01:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
um the animal shelter facilities having
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
to obtain Health certificates for dogs
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
cats and ferrets who are imported into
 
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for resale um that is
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
definitely a hole in the current law
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful to have written
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
in um it is my understanding that they
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
are generally doing that anyway but this
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
just makes sure that nobody out there
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
can get away without those Health
 
01:05:10.589 --> 01:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
certificates um and as you all know from
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
the health certificate database bill
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty important thing to be able
 
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
to track healthy animals coming into the
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
state or other diseases that may come up
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
so we definitely support the addition of
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
that link language and lastly the piece
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
about checking microchips um for
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
registered owners or agents whether
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
primary or secondary to ensure that all
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
potential owners are contacted if an
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
animal is found before it is allowed to
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
be um sold by the shelter or rescue we
 
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:49.640 align:start position:0%
think that that's very important um so
 
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
overall just want to provide support on
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and take a look at that
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment when I get a chance and let
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
you all know if there is any concerns
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
there and I would take any
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you do I see any uh
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
M see n thank you so much for your
 
01:06:13.559 --> 01:06:15.870 align:start position:0%
M see n thank you so much for your
testimony

testimony
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
today and is there anybody else who has
 
01:06:18.839 --> 01:06:20.230 align:start position:0%
today and is there anybody else who has
a

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
seeing that um I just report here for
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet that we have 43
 
01:06:38.589 --> 01:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill with no oppose um
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
no opposition so um be there for call
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair I'm gonna take
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
a about a 10-minute
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
recess so that the members can stretch
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
their legs and we're going to come back
 
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
and we're going to do few bills for exec
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll uh this 10:12 let's reconvene
 
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
at 10:25 and we'll do some
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%

yes yes Dy yes M
yes

01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.709 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
yes yes chair yes pass 18 so I will ask
 
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
the committee we can put this on consent
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
what is the will of the committee do we
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
want this to be on consent or do we want
 
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
to put it on the house floor so to speak
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
and whatever it presents itself to be
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
and and have a little discussion on it
 
01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
what what is the will of the committee
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
I see representative bix's hand up yeah
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
um so I think that in uh there actually
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be opposition in order to have
 
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
a discussion on the house floor and uh
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
since we voted it uh unanimously I don't
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
think that the clerk will let us discuss
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
it on the house
 
01:42:44.669 --> 01:42:44.679 align:start position:0%
floor thank you representative
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
viby any further input yes
 
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
represent yes well I think that since um
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
we are unanimous in
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
this probably do not need to have a
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
debate on the floor um especially in
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
this time where uh we have we will have
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
some work ahead of us and we want get
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
our our sessions done in an expedient
 
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
H thank you representative any further
 
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
conversation uh statement yes I believe
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
that uh consent uh is appropriate and
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
mention could be made in a pi
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
briefly if if it goes on the consent
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
calendar there'll be no Pi it's all done
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
in one
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
vote okay thank you uh representative B
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
question for the chair would it be
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
possible to put it on the regular
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
calendar no debate so there's a vot or I
 
01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
Duty uh no I didn't quite hear what that
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
said I think I'm repeating it so it
 
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
would be possible to bring them back at
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
some point when we can meet in rep's
 
01:44:07.390 --> 01:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
Hall and maybe do a an award or
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
accomodation or
 
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
something uh I don't think we could
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
bring them back but we could certainly
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
calendar and it uh you know if the
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
speaker chose to he could do a mention
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
as he called the bill okay
 
01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.189 align:start position:0%
as he called the bill okay
representative

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
sakas thank you Mr chair I just um just
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
want to put it out there that we know
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
that there's certain Representatives
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
that are always against this kind of
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
Bill and not to overlook the the chance
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
that it might be taken off consent by
 
01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
people thank you representative Bixby
 
01:44:47.229 --> 01:44:47.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so um another approach if we wanted
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
to do some recognition would be to uh do
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
an unanimous consent address and just
 
01:44:57.070 --> 01:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
you know spend a c two or three minutes
 
01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
mentioning how well these uh kids did in
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
our in in their presentation and uh that
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
would get it out to the Full House
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
without having to um have a an an
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
argument or a mock argument or anything
 
01:45:12.159 --> 01:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
argument or a mock argument or anything
like

01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
that any further comments representative
 
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
Aon I would offer that we put it on the
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and perhaps um draft a
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
letter from our committee to the school
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh to the teacher and students uh
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
letting them know um the you know how
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
the bill was
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
handled and I think that might be
 
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
something too and surely when the
 
01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
governor signs uh the bill into law
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they would be able to have some
 
01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
sort of reception or something for the
 
01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:49.470 align:start position:0%
sort of reception or something for the
kids

01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:54.070 align:start position:0%
kids
then

01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
I like the sound of all of what we're
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
giv so I guess it sounds like we should
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
put the the bill on the consent calendar
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Bixby if You' like
 
01:46:04.830 --> 01:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
to do unanimous consent perhaps that's
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
something uh yourself and in another
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
Committee Member or or whatever could we
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%

01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
agreement with
 
01:46:13.159 --> 01:46:14.910 align:start position:0%
agreement with
that

01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah all right then I will place it on
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
the consent
 
01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:41.430 align:start position:0%
the consent
now

01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
we got time to do one more simple one
 
01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.830 align:start position:0%
we got time to do one more simple one
before

01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:47.189 align:start position:0%
before
we

01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
hearing next will EXA house fill 627 7
 
01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:55.719 align:start position:0%
FNA I will call on representative Bixby
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
for a motion okay I would like to uh
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
move retain on uh uh HB 627 and um speak
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
to my motion do we have a
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
second yes second all right
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative Aon second representative
 
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
Bixby you are are recognized to speak
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
your motion yes I think that um from the
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard and from uh
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
communication I've gotten from from
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
other people as well uh there is support
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
for doing something like this but uh the
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that uh were in the bill as
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
presented were not sufficient to do it
 
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
right and I think that if we have a
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
chance to study it uh over the summer
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
and fall then we can put in uh uh we we
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
can amend the legislation in order to
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
bring it back right in the second year
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the bium uh so uh that's uh I hope
 
01:47:52.750 --> 01:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
that everyone will vote to retain on
 
01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:54.750 align:start position:0%
that everyone will vote to retain on
this

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:54.760 align:start position:0%

agree with representative Bixby that
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%

funding and uh some issues that
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%

acte I'm here today to introduce House
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 366 finding
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
in this is a bill that I introduced last
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
year it's kind of an important issue
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
because we
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
have excuse me many high-profile cases
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
that are dealing with the animal fol as
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
they relate to
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
foring and foring has certainly been a
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
part of many of these
 
01:57:59.229 --> 01:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
cases all too often people with mental
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
illnesses and related conditions end up
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
in snowed in the criminal justice system
 
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
although improvements have been made and
 
01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
despite the best efforts of mental
 
01:58:10.669 --> 01:58:10.679 align:start position:0%
health Advocates our criminal justice
 
01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
system is not adequate adequately
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
equipped to handle these
 
01:58:17.229 --> 01:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
cases at present a mentally ill
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
defendant's best hope is that his
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
criminal defend attorney the judge or a
 
01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
probation officer has enough knowledge
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
and understanding to detect the need for
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
a mental health evaluation as part of
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal
 
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
proceeds animal hoing disorder is a
 
01:58:32.669 --> 01:58:32.679 align:start position:0%
particularly complex mental health
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
illness requiring a multidisciplinary

cases teeder of animals and criminal
 
01:58:49.069 --> 01:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
prosecution alone is an insufficient
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
resp response in these
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
situations in the interest of the

Hampshire judicial system could

the animal cruelty statute a provision
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
triggering the question of whether the
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
defendant being charged might be
 
01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
suffering from a m mental illness and
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
desperate need of treatment and not
 
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution all I think this is a very
 
01:59:19.709 --> 01:59:19.719 align:start position:0%
important issue for our committee to uh
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
look into and
 
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
consider the bill as it's written I
 
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
recognize is is good but I think there's
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
still a couple of areas that we'll want
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
to take a look at and so as we go
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
forward and listen to the additional
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I think it will highlight
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
some of the areas where the bill is
 
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
strong and perhaps some areas where we
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
still need to look at it as a
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
committee with that I'm going to uh end
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
my testimony and I'll be happy to accept
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
any questions with the caveat that we
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
have two people and testify behind me
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
that have a lot more knowledge in this
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
area than myself so if you have real
 
01:59:55.950 --> 01:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
technical questions I would encourage
 
02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes thank you for taking my
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
question um I was wondering if uh there
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
are if you're aware of other areas of
 
02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
law where statute requires the
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
evaluation the psychological evaluation
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
of defendants and if you use that as a
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
model for uh the language that you have
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
here I am not and this was some language
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
that I worked with OSS and just
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
explained to him what I was trying to do
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
and this is the way that they put it
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
together and recommended that we proceed
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
again I think there's some areas within
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
the the criminal justice code that we
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps need to look a little further at
 
02:00:40.830 --> 02:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
this because I there's a stipulation
 
02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:42.679 align:start position:0%
where we may be putting officers in the
 
02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
position to make a mental health
 
02:00:46.709 --> 02:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
judgment that they may not be qualified
 
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:48.679 align:start position:0%
to make so again I recognize there areas
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
that we still need to work on this thank
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh representative
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
Duty H yes thank you for taking my
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
question when I read the bill I seem to
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to be equating hoarding with a
 
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
mental illness um first of all is that
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
what you wanted and secondly are there
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't there be instances where
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
hoarding is due to another issue and not
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily a mental
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
illness there certainly could be I mean
 
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
reporting disorder in in itself again
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's some folks that are
 
02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
going to speak behind me that speak very
 
02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
knowledgeably to that more than I will
 
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
but there definitely is a correlation
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
between hoarding disorder in other areas
 
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
of their life and hoarding animals in
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
many cases maybe not in every case in I
 
02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
mean the biggest thing that we're
 
02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
concerned with here is that animals are
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
cared for properly I certainly don't
 
02:01:51.629 --> 02:01:51.639 align:start position:0%
want the legislature to be deciding how
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
many animals any one person can have
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
that is not my intent as long as the
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
animals are cared for and done so
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
appropriately then you know it's not the
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
state's concern as to how many animals
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
anyone has but when the the uh situation
 
02:02:07.229 --> 02:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
becomes that the animals are not being
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
cared for properly and and there's
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
identified that there's a problem
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
certainly hoarding disorder does come
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
into play in some of these cases and and
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
it would it would better serve the
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
defendant in some cases if the language
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
is correct that they would be able to
 
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
move through the process quicker and it
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
certainly would serve the animals and
 
02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:32.069 --> 02:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
concern thank
 
02:02:34.589 --> 02:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
you representative muray you think your
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
hand out I did thank you madam chair for
 
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you to the
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor for taking my question uh on a
 
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
similar vein I guess I was just curious
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
I know that we are seeing in criminal
 
02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
justice avenues that there are drug
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
Courts are there or or are you aware of
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
any scenario where there are like a
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
mental health advocacy court or anything
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
of that nature um to be able to in in I
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
guess dovetail onto representative
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
Duty's Point um we without the careful
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
consideration of folks who are trained
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
to make that assertation wouldn't want
 
02:03:14.239 --> 02:03:15.990 align:start position:0%
to make that assertation wouldn't want
to

02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
um make a judgment prior to that
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
being done
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
carefully thank you for the question and
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
certainly that's a great consideration
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
and and again there there's an area here
 
02:03:29.229 --> 02:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
where we're asking law enforcement I
 
02:03:31.390 --> 02:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
feel to make a a decision that I'm not
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
positive there ready to make yet as as
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
far as the first part of your question I
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
think um one of the next people that are
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
coming will be able to speak to what's
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
currently available in law a lot better
 
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
than I will so I I'll defer that portion
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
of the question to one of the the other
 
02:03:48.549 --> 02:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
speakers that's coming thank you for the
 
02:03:48.559 --> 02:03:53.790 align:start position:0%
speakers that's coming thank you for the
question

02:03:53.790 --> 02:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:55.629 --> 02:03:55.639 align:start position:0%
any other members of the
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
no I would like to call Stacy ogre to
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
testify and please state your name your
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:24.350 align:start position:0%
 
state

02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
morning sorry it looks like my zoom just
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
had me log out and log back in I'm just
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
um there I can join you by video as well
 
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
good morning thanks for the opportunity
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
to speak with all of you and I'm
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
grateful that uh chairman Pearl has
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
refiled this bill for your consideration
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
my name is Stacy obber I am the
 
02:04:56.830 --> 02:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
government relations contact for the
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
American Kennel Club and this bill was
 
02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
filed last year um released by the
 
02:05:05.069 --> 02:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
committee and approved by the house last
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
March I just want to acknowledge that uh
 
02:05:11.149 --> 02:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
the American Kennel Club Works to ensure
 
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
that the rights of responsible owners
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
and breeders are protected but also that
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
anyone regardless of the number of dogs
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
they own
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
who treats a dog negligently or cruy is
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
held responsible for those
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
actions this bill is about those
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
occasions where an individual's neglect
 
02:05:33.790 --> 02:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
or cruel treatment of animals is not the
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
result of Criminal Intent or activity
 
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
but instead is a symptom of uh a mental
 
02:05:43.069 --> 02:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
illness known as Animal Hoarding
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
disorder and when these cases come to
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
light people may draw simplified but
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
inaccurate conclusions that anyone who
 
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
owns a certain number of dogs for
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
instance cannot adequately care for them
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
and this can result in proposals that
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
either limit or restrict dog ownership
 
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
but in the end does nothing to address
 
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
the underlying mental illness that cause
 
02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
the serious health and safety problems
 
02:06:14.350 --> 02:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
for uh both people and pets in the WR
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I submitted to
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I provide specific New
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cases uh where
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's I guess suspected that in fact
 
02:06:29.229 --> 02:06:29.239 align:start position:0%
these were Animal Hoarding disorder
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
situations and individuals who suffer
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
from the disorder often deny their
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
failure to provide adequate Animal Care
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
and they also deny the deplorable
 
02:06:42.189 --> 02:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
conditions under which they're living
 
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
and it's unfortunate but uh few
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
recognize that Animal Hoarding disorder
 
02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:49.430 align:start position:0%
recognize that Animal Hoarding disorder
is

02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh a mental health illness and that it
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
is a significant Community concern um
 
02:06:57.149 --> 02:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
because not only are the animals harmed
 
02:06:59.950 --> 02:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
but excuse me humans are too including
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
everyone that's living under these
 
02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
unsanitary conditions and also anyone in
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
the surrounding Community who might be
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
impacted as well um in addition to my
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
written testimony I just wanted to
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledge with you all that a Dr Gary
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
patronek was a veterinarian at tus
 
02:07:18.549 --> 02:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
veterinary school which is the only vet
 
02:07:20.830 --> 02:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
School here in New England and he was on
 
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
the faculty and spent a lot of time
 
02:07:26.589 --> 02:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
studying this particular subject and had
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
done multiple studies and I just wanted
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
to share a couple of Statistics with you
 
02:07:33.870 --> 02:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
all um he concluded that Animal Hoarding
 
02:07:36.669 --> 02:07:36.679 align:start position:0%
disorder causes more animal suffering
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
than all acts of intentional cruelty
 
02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
combined and one of his studies of
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
Cruelty charges in Animal Hoarding cases
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
across the United States He determined
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
that uh dogs and cats were the most
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
popular animals that were hoarded and
 
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
that only
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
26% of the animal cruelty cases in which
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
charges were filed and information was
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
available indicated
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
that courts ordered a defendant to
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
undergo a pre-trial psychological
 
02:08:11.069 --> 02:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
assessment or any mental health
 
02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
evaluation and this is despite Court's
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
having both the discretion and the
 
02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
budget to require a psychological
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation of defendant um the reason is
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
some courts may not understand that a
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
diagnosable mental health issue is the
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
real cause of the animal cruelty in the
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
first place and also the data in the
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
literature show that without treating
 
02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:34.790 align:start position:0%
literature show that without treating
the

02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:39.310 --> 02:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
psychological um disorder itself 100% of
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
animal hoarders will repeat their
 
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
behavior so uh what some states have
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
begun to do is to pass laws that
 
02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
specifically require courts to order a
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
psychological evaluation and treatment
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
if necessary when charges of animal
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
cruelty are filed and so to answer
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
rep's uh question about you know whether
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
or not there's anything in New Hampshire
 
02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
Statute in the written testimony that I
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
submitted to you all I do have reference
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
to a section of the animal cruelty
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
Statute in New Hampshire uh that refers
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
to beastiality and there is language
 
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
there that um highlights a court
 
02:09:21.709 --> 02:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
ordering psychological evaluation and
 
02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
treatment in an animal cruelty of case
 
02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
of that nature and I've also shared with
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
you the exact language from other New
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
England states that have in fact
 
02:09:34.549 --> 02:09:34.559 align:start position:0%
included language more as a raising
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
awareness um in the animal cruelty
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
statute that in fact uh a defendant
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's before the court may be suffering
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
from Animal Hoarding disorder um my
 
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
colleague Eileen casy who is an expert
 
02:09:53.069 --> 02:09:53.079 align:start position:0%
clinician in this area and has the
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
mental health background um I believe is
 
02:09:58.270 --> 02:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
registered to testify this morning and
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
can answer any detailed questions you
 
02:10:04.189 --> 02:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
might have um about the disorder uh but
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bill in and of itself it's our hope
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
would more or less raise the flag for
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system that a
 
02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
defendant who's brought before the court
 
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
May in fact be in need of a
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
psychological evaluation and perhaps
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
treatment so we can avoid this repeat
 
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
repeat pattern of collecting animals um
 
02:10:31.229 --> 02:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
by someone who's left untreated in the
 
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
community so that's that's basically why
 
02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
the bill was
 
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
filed thank
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you for that uh do we have any
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
over I don't see any questions so thank
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
you very much for your
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
would excuse me um I would like to Now
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
call eileene
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%

02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
state yes hello everyone my name is
 
02:11:14.589 --> 02:11:14.599 align:start position:0%

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
independent clinical social worker in
 
02:11:19.069 --> 02:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts
 
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
joining you all from
 
02:11:23.069 --> 02:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
Melrose um I wanted to share some
 
02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
remarks in support of this particular
 
02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
bill on Animal
 
02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
Hoarding so I prepared some some written
 
02:11:34.109 --> 02:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
testimony here Animal Hoarding is a
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
complex often misunderstood and
 
02:11:39.870 --> 02:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
underrecognized public health problem
 
02:11:43.709 --> 02:11:43.719 align:start position:0%
affecting both animal and human welfare
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
typical responses to Animal Hoarding
 
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
cases include involuntary seizure of the
 
02:11:51.950 --> 02:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
animals and prosecution of the
 
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
individual who hoarded the animals this
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
approach can yield up to 100% of reivisa
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
hoarding cases due to professionals only
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
focusing on the symptom of the issue
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
which is the accumulated animals this
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
approach fails to recognize that the
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
collection of animals is congruent with
 
02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
a diagnosable mental health disorder
 
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
without meical and carefully
 
02:12:22.830 --> 02:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
orchestrated psychotherapeutic approach
 
02:12:24.669 --> 02:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
the individual will continue their
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
Animal Hoarding Behavior at a much more
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
rapid rate so meaning accumulating more
 
02:12:32.669 --> 02:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
animals including
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
Strays therefore prohibiting the person
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
from adopting or buying new pets is also
 
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
an ineffective approach Animal Hoarding
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
is classified as an additional specifier
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
under the clinical mental health
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of hoarding disorder in the
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
diagnostic and statistical Manual of
 
02:12:56.109 --> 02:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
mental disorders also known as the
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
dsm5 of which I'd like to share that
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
diagnostic criteria with you all and it
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
is as follows a failure to provide
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
minimal standards of Sanitation space
 
02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
nutrition and veterinary care for the
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
animals followed by that there's a
 
02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
presence of the inability to recognize
 
02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
the adverse effects on the welfare of
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
the animals the residents residing in
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
the home and the home environment as a
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
whole and lastly this is coupled with
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
the presence of obsessive attempts to
 
02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
accumulate or maintain a collection of
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
animals despite the two deteriorating
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
conditions of the animals and the
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
environment lastly the person presents
 
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
with denial or even minimization of
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
evident problems regarding the living
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
conditions for the person and animals
 
02:13:49.229 --> 02:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
three dis distinct types of
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
characteristics are also identified when
 
02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
we're considering Animal Hoarding cases
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
the typology is as follows number one
 
02:13:59.790 --> 02:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
there's um one that we think of we
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
classify as an overwhelmed
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
caregiver secondly um someone might be
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
considered a rescuer so feeling this
 
02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
compulsive need to continue to
 
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
accumulate animals and then lastly there
 
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
might be one which is a little bit more
 
02:14:18.549 --> 02:14:18.559 align:start position:0%
rare which is considered an exploit are
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
type this is important um to recognize
 
02:14:24.270 --> 02:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
typology because it can inform the type
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
of intervention a mental health provider
 
02:14:29.950 --> 02:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
can take as well as anyone else who
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
might be a part of that team likee
 
02:14:35.149 --> 02:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
approach so harm reduction is a
 
02:14:37.870 --> 02:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
suggested pragmatic technique when
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
addressing Animal Hoarding cases so
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
meaning that working with the person to
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
minimize risks through concrete and
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
objective goals so some harm reduction
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
strategies include developing rapport
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
with the individual question offering
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
psycho education on ways to
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately care for the animals which
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
can include spay and neutering the
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
animals outlined check-ins or visits by
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
such stakeholders that are involved in
 
02:15:07.709 --> 02:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
the case and potentially referrals to
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
ongoing longer term
 
02:15:12.430 --> 02:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
treatment we must also consider that the
 
02:15:14.669 --> 02:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
animals when they are removed and
 
02:15:16.270 --> 02:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
considering their behavior and their
 
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes as well so when considering
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
what that might look like medical and
 
02:15:23.069 --> 02:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues of the animals can
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
lead to difficulties in adoption and
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
even longer term placements overcrowding
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
in local shelters can also lead to
 
02:15:34.669 --> 02:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
unnecessary euthanasia referred to as
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
the caring killing Paradox within the
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
field therefore it's critical to explore
 
02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
the ways of minimizing and resolving
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
risk with the resident first before
 
02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
exploring some of those further options
 
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
lastly the psychiatric provider assigned
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
to the case as mandated by the court
 
02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
should determine the appropriate length
 
02:15:56.669 --> 02:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
of time for the recommended amount of
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
sessions as outlined within the
 
02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic treatment plan the
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutic approach should be directive
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
with co-created goals by both the
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
therapist and the client um and this can
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
include ways that reunification may be
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
possible as well if animals are placed
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
within temporary
 
02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
custody um just to to provide some some
 
02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
preface here or some background I am a
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker in the state of
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I specialize in the
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
treatment of hoarding disorder and I
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
have worked with a number of cases that
 
02:16:34.589 --> 02:16:34.599 align:start position:0%
do also entail both Animal Hoarding as
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
well as possession hoarding so thank you
 
02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
for your
 
02:16:41.629 --> 02:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
time thank you so much for that
 
02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
testimony do we have any questions from
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
yes you please email me your testimony
 
02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:56.669 align:start position:0%
yes you please email me your testimony
yes

02:16:56.669 --> 02:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:59.549 --> 02:16:59.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative
 
02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:02.599 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes um I was wondering if there is
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
a a a track track record for the
 
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic approach you've laid out and
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
and what that track record is okay
 
02:17:14.589 --> 02:17:14.599 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um so the
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic approach that I've laid out
 
02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
um in case
 
02:17:21.309 --> 02:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
of entailing hoarding disorder if an
 
02:17:24.110 --> 02:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
individual is actually involved in
 
02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing therapy um and is committed to
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
the required number of sessions so
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
typical number of sessions might be
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 24 to 26 sessions in total
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
um generally on a weekly basis that's
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's what's recommended we can see
 
02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:42.830 align:start position:0%
that's what's recommended we can see
about

02:17:42.830 --> 02:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
46% Effectiveness
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:54.910 --> 02:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
literature thank you um representative
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
question uh yes thank you for taking my
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
question uh what is uh can you go
 
02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
through the process of how you get a
 
02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
referral so at the time of somebody
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
makes a complaint about an animal and at
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
that point can you walk us through that
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
process about how it gets to
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
you I think that's a great question
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I've you know I have to
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
be quite Frank is that a lot of my work
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
here in New England and in Massachusetts
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
is Raising awareness that these types of
 
02:18:36.509 --> 02:18:36.519 align:start position:0%
cases should entail collaboration with
 
02:18:39.070 --> 02:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
mental health support so unfortunately a
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of Animal Hoarding cases may only
 
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
involve um Animal Welfare for instance
 
02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
um so through ongoing Outreach and
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the MSPCA as well as
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
the Animal Rescue League for instance as
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
well as Animal Control Officers here
 
02:19:01.469 --> 02:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
within our state um I then am informed
 
02:19:04.589 --> 02:19:04.599 align:start position:0%
of a case through any of those Avenues
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just self-referral
 
02:19:09.629 --> 02:19:09.639 align:start position:0%
only so one of those types of
 
02:19:12.629 --> 02:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
professionals will contact me directly
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
and inform me that they've come across a
 
02:19:16.509 --> 02:19:16.519 align:start position:0%
case and that they would like my
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
involvement with that particular case
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
and then from there I will take steps to
 
02:19:25.309 --> 02:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
meet with those parties and then plan
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
what should that next step look like I
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
will share that at this point I'm also
 
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
working um and I I sit on the Statewide
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
steering committee for hoarding here in
 
02:19:37.389 --> 02:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so at this point what that
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
means is that this is sort of um a
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
collaboration of all of the hoarding
 
02:19:45.070 --> 02:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
task forces within our Commonwealth and
 
02:19:47.469 --> 02:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
we're trying to inform each of those
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
task force is that should they come
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
across an Animal Hoarding case what
 
02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
should they do what should that look
 
02:19:56.230 --> 02:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
like so again trying to increase
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
awareness and increase Outreach and
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
collaboration with animal control um
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the state overall and knowing
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
and letting them know that there is uh
 
02:20:08.710 --> 02:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
mental health support that's
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
available Madam chair may I have a
 
02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:13.429 align:start position:0%
available Madam chair may I have a
followup

02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
followup
 
02:20:16.230 --> 02:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
certainly uh thank
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
you uh uh where does the court um come
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
into this process or does it not at at
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
at this
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
point okay um so at this point the cases
 
02:20:33.389 --> 02:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
that I've worked on have been U managed
 
02:20:36.510 --> 02:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
within the community prior to getting to
 
02:20:37.710 --> 02:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
court for instance however if if charges
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
are filed um we would then be mindful of
 
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
um then you know should it proceed
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
before the court what what can we do um
 
02:20:55.469 --> 02:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
I have to say that I do not have
 
02:20:59.469 --> 02:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
experience once it's gotten to that
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
level thank you you're
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much uh
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative ston you have your
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:21:14.910 --> 02:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I missed the
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
boarding typologies you mentioned three
 
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
of them could you go over those briefly
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
again please yes absolutely so the three
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
typologies um we have um the first
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
typology which is considered an
 
02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:32.790 align:start position:0%
typology which is considered an
overwhelmed

02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
caregiver so that means that perhaps
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'll give an example that as someone has
 
02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
aged for instance um their circumstances
 
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's physical cognitive or even
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
Financial have changed the way in which
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
they can continue to care for the animal
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
so perhaps the number of animals they
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
had at one point was within re reason
 
02:21:57.790 --> 02:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
and over time it it it then became out
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
of their control um whenever Mental
 
02:22:02.670 --> 02:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
Health Providers or other professionals
 
02:22:05.950 --> 02:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
are involved in such cases um things
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
tend to be a little bit more seamless
 
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
and we're able to get much more
 
02:22:13.630 --> 02:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
cooperation from the resident the second
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
typology is considered um what we would
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
deem a rescuer so someone who we have we
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
can see a little bit more of that
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
compulsive like act that is really
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
prevalent um within this particular
 
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
Disorder so an impulsive need or urge to
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
continue to accumulate animals even if
 
02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
there are really adverse effects within
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
the environment so deteriorating
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
conditions of the environment
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
deteriorating conditions of the animals
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
within the space or even potentially
 
02:22:49.950 --> 02:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
deceased animals the last typology um
 
02:22:51.550 --> 02:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
and again I mentioned that this is a
 
02:22:53.950 --> 02:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more rare when thinking about
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
this particular disorder is something
 
02:22:59.230 --> 02:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
called or classified as an exploiter
 
02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
type I have not had experience with this
 
02:23:04.870 --> 02:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
particular type I've communicated with
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
other professionals even across the
 
02:23:09.469 --> 02:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
country and they indicate that their
 
02:23:12.670 --> 02:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
encounters with this type is also rather
 
02:23:16.030 --> 02:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
rare so that means we can break that
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
that typology down a little bit further
 
02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
is that someone will continue to
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
accumulate animals um based off of other
 
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
um monetary Gaines or other needs so
 
02:23:29.870 --> 02:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of attachment to the
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
animal in and of itself um so you might
 
02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
see this when you're thinking about say
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
um overbreeding of animals for instance
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
or or puppy mill like
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
situations thank you very much you're
 
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.750 align:start position:0%
situations thank you very much you're
welcome

02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:23:50.309 --> 02:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Murray you had a
 
02:23:52.830 --> 02:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
question I did uh thank you madam chair
 
02:23:56.429 --> 02:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um and thank you
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
um Miss Daisy for taking my question as
 
02:24:02.110 --> 02:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
you are aware there are many other um
 
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
mental health conditions Beyond uh the
 
02:24:07.150 --> 02:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
disorder class of obsessive disorders um
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
in hoarding with regard to the dsm5 and
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
what is your assessment of the ability
 
02:24:18.110 --> 02:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
for fure first responding whether it's
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
as you said in the community whether
 
02:24:21.389 --> 02:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
it's a law enforcement officer or an
 
02:24:23.230 --> 02:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
animal rights officer coming out to take
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
a look to be able to know what to do
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
once they might suspect that there is a
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
mental health issue
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
there okay um great question um and
 
02:24:37.950 --> 02:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
you're Keen to to pick up on that as
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
well so um to provide background
 
02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
boarding disorder does fall under the
 
02:24:46.030 --> 02:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
obsessive compulsive disorder or OCD and
 
02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
related disorder
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
Spectrum um so there's a lot of
 
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
similarity a lot of overlap and even
 
02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:52.510 align:start position:0%
similarity a lot of overlap and even
some

02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
differences um and of those with hording
 
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
disorder about 92% of those will also
 
02:25:02.349 --> 02:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
present with another existing
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
comorbidity meaning another mental
 
02:25:07.389 --> 02:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
health diagnosis whether it's diagnosed
 
02:25:07.399 --> 02:25:08.870 align:start position:0%
health diagnosis whether it's diagnosed
or

02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
undiagnosed when providers are first
 
02:25:15.269 --> 02:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
encountering a case um so a lot of my
 
02:25:17.469 --> 02:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
professional experience has in training
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement across Massachusetts as
 
02:25:23.469 --> 02:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
part of their preliminary mental health
 
02:25:26.269 --> 02:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
engagement and training with individuals
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
within the community um is being able to
 
02:25:31.630 --> 02:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
take an opportunity to assess the
 
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
situation and also find an opportunity
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
to develop any type of rapport with the
 
02:25:40.429 --> 02:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
resident um and so what I mean by assess
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
the situation is first taking a look at
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
what risks might be um evident within
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
the space
 
02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
as well as risk for the individual and
 
02:25:53.510 --> 02:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
risk for the animals as well and them
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
reacting based off of those imminent
 
02:25:57.630 --> 02:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
risks if there are imminent risks that
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
are there um so whether that means okay
 
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
there are concerns but we can step away
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
from the situation and then plan for
 
02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
followup but over the course of that
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
time before followup occurs does that
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
also mean filing a report or um a file
 
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
to say Adult Protective Services or
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
child protective services so if we're
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about dependent individuals
 
02:26:26.429 --> 02:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
within the home or even if the resident
 
02:26:28.830 --> 02:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
is elderly themselves and there are
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:35.429 --> 02:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
space I hope that answers your question
 
02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
no it does thank you for taking you're
 
02:26:39.389 --> 02:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
welcome you for that and uh
 
02:26:42.030 --> 02:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
representative Highland you had a
 
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair for
 
02:26:45.070 --> 02:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
02:26:47.790 --> 02:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
my so my question has to do with I guess
 
02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily a question but more
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
of would you
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
recommend what would okay what would you
 
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
recommend as a follow-up
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
procedure this person or these cases go
 
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
through kind of what we've been talking
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
about maybe they do go go through a
 
02:27:11.269 --> 02:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
court system and as per how it reads
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
there is an evaluation you know an
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation might be
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
recommended and there's a mental health
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
professional that goes through what that
 
02:27:22.349 --> 02:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
treatment process would look like as
 
02:27:23.429 --> 02:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
you've already we've already been
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
through some of that as far as the court
 
02:27:29.309 --> 02:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
system or the municipality
 
02:27:31.469 --> 02:27:31.479 align:start position:0%
or I guess what would you recommend is a
 
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up procedure because I feel like
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
maybe that might need in in my opinion
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
might need some discussion thank
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
you okay all right thank you
 
02:27:44.070 --> 02:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative Highland um you know my
 
02:27:46.830 --> 02:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation my strong recommendation
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
is engagement with therapeutic support
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
so whether that's through the court
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
system or within the community okay um
 
02:27:57.630 --> 02:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
so if it's within the court system then
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
a referral to um an actual psychological
 
02:28:03.469 --> 02:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
evaluation to determine first and
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
foremost is this actually Animal
 
02:28:08.309 --> 02:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hoarding right is that what the the
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
person is presenting with um so
 
02:28:13.950 --> 02:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
identifying what that presenting problem
 
02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
is then informs the course of treatment
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
um and then if it is Animal Hoarding
 
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
right is is actually then thinking about
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
a referral to ongoing treatment and
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
going through that entire process the
 
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
same process would occur within the
 
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
community as well um but within the
 
02:28:34.990 --> 02:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
community there then needs to be a
 
02:28:37.710 --> 02:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
little bit more of a discussion of what
 
02:28:39.870 --> 02:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
that means for the person to actually
 
02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
engage so if it's just law enforcement
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
for instance having that conversation
 
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
with a resident hey I think I need you
 
02:28:50.590 --> 02:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
to connect with a counselor the person
 
02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
might State no I'm not interested but if
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement came out to the
 
02:28:58.910 --> 02:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
residents um in collaboration with a
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
mental health supporter such as such as
 
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
myself a mental health provider can then
 
02:29:07.469 --> 02:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
have that conversation around what this
 
02:29:09.550 --> 02:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
would actually mean what would that look
 
02:29:12.670 --> 02:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
like to actually get connected with
 
02:29:15.389 --> 02:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
therapy and to think about the ways in
 
02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
which perhaps
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining care for the animals has
 
02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
been problematic in their own lives how
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
can we enhance that together so then
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
becomes a little bit more of a dactic
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
and collaborative conversation and
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
therefore that that yields a higher
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
chance that the person's actually going
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
to want to participate in
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
therapy thank you you're
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
welcome okay uh actually I have a
 
02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
question interested to know if you are
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
aware of a network of therapists in New
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that specifically deal with
 
02:29:54.910 --> 02:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
animal boarding
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
issues okay great question thank you I
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
am not aware of any particular
 
02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
Specialist or therapist that has great
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
specialty in treating hoarding disorder
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
or Animal Hoarding Behavior within New
 
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however what I will add to
 
02:30:17.790 --> 02:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
that is that considering hoing disorder
 
02:30:19.469 --> 02:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
is within the
 
02:30:22.510 --> 02:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
dsm5 that means that a mental health
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
provider should be able to take on the
 
02:30:28.469 --> 02:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
case um considering that we've all gone
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
through this process as clinicians that
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
we are well-versed within the DSM and if
 
02:30:37.389 --> 02:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
a case is referred to a therapist it's
 
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
our ethical obligation that if we feel
 
02:30:41.550 --> 02:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
we really can't take it on that we
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
should make those proactive steps of
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
connecting them with the appropriate
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
provider who's more equipped in taking
 
02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
on that particular
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
case thank you because um the only
 
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
reason why I would ask that is say an
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
animal control officer sees you know
 
02:31:02.590 --> 02:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
comes upon
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
situation where somebody
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
has you know a hoarding well looks like
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
a hoarding situation so I wonder is
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
there like a list of special therapists
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
that then they would contact once the
 
02:31:26.349 --> 02:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
animals are confiscated or you know how
 
02:31:28.910 --> 02:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure how the whole
 
02:31:31.630 --> 02:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
process would play
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
out I think that that would require
 
02:31:38.349 --> 02:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
further conversation exploration and the
 
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
development probably of some sort of a
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
compiled list or resource directory so
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
something of that nature exists here in
 
02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:46.990 align:start position:0%
something of that nature exists here in
Mass

02:31:46.990 --> 02:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
Mass
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um and it would be
 
02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
beneficial if that were a mirrored also
 
02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
within New
 
02:31:56.830 --> 02:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you so much um I see
 
02:31:58.590 --> 02:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby your hand is still
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
up did you still have a
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
question yes I I actually have a
 
02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
separate question um so I was wondering
 
02:32:10.389 --> 02:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh if there is an issue well how is the
 
02:32:14.309 --> 02:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
monetary end of uh access to mental
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
health dealt with because um I don't
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
know that there's I that that there is
 
02:32:24.269 --> 02:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
any sort of mechanism readily available
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
for paying for uh these sorts of
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
surfaces particularly when the um the
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
the person involved might not be aware
 
02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:40.710 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:32:40.720 --> 02:32:42.950 align:start position:0%
it
okay

02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
um that's a complicated question um
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
considering that again hoarding disorder
 
02:32:53.790 --> 02:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
is within the dsm5 that means that um a
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
a mental health provider can actually
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
bill for the services under their health
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
insurance plan um Medicare Medicaid even
 
02:33:05.950 --> 02:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
commercial private insurance plans as
 
02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
well um if an individual is not quite um
 
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
interested in engaging in Services I
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
think that that yields a different
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
convers ation right so that means that
 
02:33:20.429 --> 02:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
the case will likely not then get opened
 
02:33:22.269 --> 02:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
for ongoing
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
treatment um a lot of Outreach
 
02:33:28.110 --> 02:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
mechanisms do exist throughout our
 
02:33:30.670 --> 02:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
country so such as whether those are
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
senior centers or Council on Aging often
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
will have an Outreach social worker
 
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's embedded within that type of of
 
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
an agency who may get involved in
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
hoarding cases um and then their
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
services or their time is then covered
 
02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
under their agency so I use that as an
 
02:33:53.550 --> 02:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
example because of the agency that I
 
02:33:57.150 --> 02:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
worked for my time was covered under my
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
agency and therefore I was able to
 
02:34:02.429 --> 02:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
engage and participate with law
 
02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement with no cost to the
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
individual some agencies such as and
 
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
I'll use MSPCA or Animal Rescue League
 
02:34:14.550 --> 02:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
again as an example had access to Grant
 
02:34:18.670 --> 02:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
funds as another alternative right um so
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
that if an individual was uninsured for
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
instance that perhaps they could
 
02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
contract my services so that I could
 
02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:29.479 align:start position:0%
then get engaged and um and help the
 
02:34:31.630 --> 02:34:31.640 align:start position:0%
individual whether it was short-term or
 
02:34:34.590 --> 02:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
even some sort of a longer term process
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to provide you with
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
some options to consider because there
 
02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
could be some possibilities for the
 
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
explore okay thank you for that and um I
 
02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
see still representative dsy have your
 
02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
see still representative dsy have your
hand

02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
up

02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:01.750 --> 02:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
oops you're muted H okay no I hit the
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
wrong button sorry thank you for thank
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I want to
 
02:35:07.389 --> 02:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
make a comment first and then I want to
 
02:35:09.870 --> 02:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
ask you a question uh the first comment
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
is in my first life I was a psychiatric
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
social worker and I worked at the
 
02:35:17.309 --> 02:35:17.319 align:start position:0%
greater Manchester Mental Health Center
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
so throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
02:35:22.389 --> 02:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
we do have mental health centers um you
 
02:35:26.510 --> 02:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
know and I agree with you a a uh social
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
worker uh could be would be trained or
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
their background would easily uh allow
 
02:35:34.670 --> 02:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
them uh to work in this field because
 
02:35:37.389 --> 02:35:37.399 align:start position:0%
they normally would work with people um
 
02:35:40.670 --> 02:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
who have issues with denial or obsessive
 
02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
compulsive disorders so it's just
 
02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
basically a subset of that so I think
 
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
from what we have in place in our Mental
 
02:35:54.349 --> 02:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
Health Community we would be able to um
 
02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
be able to assess and and treat these
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
people so that's number one number two
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
is how many cases do you uh actively
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
have opened and how many cases of
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
hoarding do you typically see in a
 
02:36:08.479 --> 02:36:10.670 align:start position:0%
hoarding do you typically see in a
year

02:36:10.670 --> 02:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you my entire specialty as a
 
02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:16.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you my entire specialty as a
clinician

02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
clinician
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
is working with cases that entail
 
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
hoarding Disorder so each of my cases
 
02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
that I have open currently are actually
 
02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
cases where the individual is presenting
 
02:36:29.469 --> 02:36:29.479 align:start position:0%
with hoarding
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
Behavior I have at this time trying to
 
02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
think about my case load is about maybe
 
02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:37.030 align:start position:0%
think about my case load is about maybe
35

02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
35
 
02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
individuals okay I may see um perhaps up
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
to 100 within any given
 
02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:49.630 align:start position:0%
to 100 within any given
year

02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
I didn't provide prevalence I think that
 
02:36:54.030 --> 02:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's important as well so if we think
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
about hoarding disorder within the
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
country in it of itself um Research
 
02:37:01.389 --> 02:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
indicates that there is a prevalence of
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere from two to up to six% of the
 
02:37:07.630 --> 02:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
US population that makes hoarding
 
02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
disorder actually the most common mental
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:18.269 align:start position:0%
 
country

02:37:18.269 --> 02:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:22.990 --> 02:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that um I see head up
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
from representative
 
02:37:28.429 --> 02:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you madam
 
02:37:33.429 --> 02:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
chair about wording inside document line
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
12 where it says immediate danger to be
 
02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
animals or life and there's not
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to obtain order could
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
you also possibly add somewhere
 
02:37:48.830 --> 02:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
that the caregivers help could be
 
02:37:50.590 --> 02:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous since we are talking about a
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
mental disorder um and
 
02:37:58.030 --> 02:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
where fac not
 
02:37:58.040 --> 02:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
where fac not
enough

02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:38:04.349 --> 02:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
it's but it possibly be added in there I
 
02:38:10.510 --> 02:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
wor I think that that's a discussion
 
02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
um all
 
02:38:26.469 --> 02:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
right and representative Highland you
 
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
had your hand
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
up thank you um most of my questions
 
02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
have been answered since you all have
 
02:38:35.550 --> 02:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
asked awesome questions but I do have a
 
02:38:37.950 --> 02:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
question about um you said that
 
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has a system for
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
contacting therapists specifically for
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
hoarding or um you know maybe within the
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
mental health uh system there do you I
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
would like to know more about that but
 
02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
also I have a question about
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
municipality involvement that we talked
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
about with followup um could there be in
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
would you recommend shelter involvement
 
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
as far as providing information like an
 
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
information resource or or some sort of
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
M Municipal resources for putting
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
information out to the public somehow I
 
02:39:17.309 --> 02:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
mean I just see the breakdown of finding
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
help I guess is is where my question is
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
coming from thank you and thank you
 
02:39:24.429 --> 02:39:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you representative
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
Highland um so the the resource
 
02:39:33.630 --> 02:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
directory that currently exists in the
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
state of
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um again was developed and
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
continues to be maintained by the
 
02:39:42.750 --> 02:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide steering committee on hoarding
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
um and so there is an actual site that
 
02:39:49.389 --> 02:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
any one can access and locate resources
 
02:39:51.309 --> 02:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
whether that means it's just mental
 
02:39:53.670 --> 02:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
health support for hoarding or even if
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
an individual is looking for biohazard
 
02:39:59.750 --> 02:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
cleanup or hoarding remediation and so
 
02:40:02.590 --> 02:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
the whole gamut is sort of there um but
 
02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
if we take it a step further um there
 
02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
are of course other National sites that
 
02:40:10.349 --> 02:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
individuals can access when they're
 
02:40:14.110 --> 02:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
looking for a therapist in particular um
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
who specializes in the treat of hoarding
 
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
Disorder so for some examples might be
 
02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
looking at Psychology today for instance
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
right and then there are filters right
 
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
where you say this is the city that the
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
individual lives in this is the
 
02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
presenting problem which would be hoing
 
02:40:34.269 --> 02:40:34.279 align:start position:0%
and then this is the insurance that the
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
person has and the no filter to show a
 
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
listing of the therapists within that
 
02:40:43.950 --> 02:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
area that can respond um then the iocdf
 
02:40:46.429 --> 02:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
website is also a national website that
 
02:40:48.910 --> 02:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
individuals can access so again that
 
02:40:50.590 --> 02:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
goes back to my point of hoarding
 
02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
disorder following falling under the OCD
 
02:40:56.429 --> 02:40:56.439 align:start position:0%
and related disorder spectrum and so
 
02:40:59.830 --> 02:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
that also has an up-to-date list as well
 
02:41:03.429 --> 02:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
um in terms of your question um around
 
02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
municipality involvement or other
 
02:41:09.550 --> 02:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
resources even potentially shelters
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
within the area I think that again there
 
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
probably should be some detailed
 
02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:16.550 align:start position:0%
probably should be some detailed
conversation

02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
around and even some Outreach if at all
 
02:41:23.349 --> 02:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
necessary so talking within um say any
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
of the animal welfare or rescue um
 
02:41:29.469 --> 02:41:29.479 align:start position:0%
organizations across the state who can
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
they reach out to should they come
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
across a particular instance and then
 
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
that the same goes for shelters as well
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that that then we just there
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
should be conversation around what does
 
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
that compiled list really consist of who
 
02:41:47.269 --> 02:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
are the therapists that people can reach
 
02:41:49.469 --> 02:41:49.479 align:start position:0%
out to and where and what should that
 
02:41:49.479 --> 02:41:50.389 align:start position:0%
out to and where and what should that
look

02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
look
 
02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
like so I know that that's a little
 
02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
vague but thank you I just may I ask a
 
02:42:00.750 --> 02:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up question sure mam thank you um
 
02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
you said that Mass sorry you said that
 
02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
the US had about a two to six% hoarding
 
02:42:11.110 --> 02:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
um so what do you do you know the I
 
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
guess you don't know the New Hampshire
 
02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
number do you do you know the
 
02:42:14.590 --> 02:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts number I'm trying to get a
 
02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
feel for what our state might have but
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
obviously we need I need to do my
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
research on that but if you have the
 
02:42:22.429 --> 02:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
mass number that would be great thank
 
02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
you you're W you're welcome
 
02:42:28.389 --> 02:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
representative Highland um I do not have
 
02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
the actual Massachusetts number and
 
02:42:32.269 --> 02:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
therefore I do not have the actual New
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire number um and because those
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
numbers you know they would need to be
 
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
tested they would need to be published
 
02:42:42.510 --> 02:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
within literature um we can't just break
 
02:42:45.389 --> 02:42:45.399 align:start position:0%
down that percentage into Geographic
 
02:42:47.710 --> 02:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
locations or that would just be false
 
02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
information that would be a
 
02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
fallacy thank you for your time you're
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
welcome okay I see um uh representative
 
02:42:58.110 --> 02:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
Murray your hand is still
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
up thank you uh thank you madam chair
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you m speak closer to the uh
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
microphone yes and thank you for is that
 
02:43:10.030 --> 02:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
better yeah okay thank you for taking my
 
02:43:12.590 --> 02:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
question so you had mentioned that there
 
02:43:14.550 --> 02:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
is a possibility that in addition to the
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
Animal Hoarding disorder that might be
 
02:43:17.469 --> 02:43:17.479 align:start position:0%
identified that there are other
 
02:43:19.309 --> 02:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
situations that might be comorbidities
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
that go along with uh something that is
 
02:43:25.309 --> 02:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
being presented um with a patient or an
 
02:43:28.349 --> 02:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
individual and so what happens if you
 
02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
had mentioned um generally 24 to
 
02:43:35.550 --> 02:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
26 treatments or insurance for insurance
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
purposes what what if it exceeds that
 
02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
what if the care needs to go beyond that
 
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
um what do the coverages look like for a
 
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
patient or an individual that you're
 
02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
typically seeing with respect to
 
02:43:52.030 --> 02:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance okay so in in that situation
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray if um these
 
02:43:59.429 --> 02:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
sessions exce or need to exceed the
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
recommended um treatment plan for
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
instance further Insurance authorization
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
would need to be um pursued and a
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
that followup if I
 
02:44:17.389 --> 02:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
may sure go right ahead um and and
 
02:44:20.910 --> 02:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
generally how long does it take to at
 
02:44:23.510 --> 02:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
least in your circumstance to get a
 
02:44:26.670 --> 02:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
patient um to treatment or care for
 
02:44:28.990 --> 02:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
provider care how long is it to find an
 
02:44:34.590 --> 02:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
nature okay um great question again
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray um in in
 
02:44:45.389 --> 02:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
my circumstances or in my experience um
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
it I haven't seen a lot of lag time so
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
if I'm able to be there physically
 
02:44:53.389 --> 02:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
myself and have that conversation with
 
02:44:56.910 --> 02:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
the person um or even if I know that the
 
02:44:58.910 --> 02:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
case might need to be referred out just
 
02:45:00.910 --> 02:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
because for Geographic reasons it just
 
02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
makes more sense to connect them with a
 
02:45:05.550 --> 02:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
therapist that's closer to where they
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
reside um in my experience it's been
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
anywhere from up to a month um in total
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
maximum of getting them connected Ed
 
02:45:17.070 --> 02:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
with a therapist and getting them
 
02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:28.110 --> 02:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
therapy okay thank you and uh
 
02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:29.429 align:start position:0%
therapy okay thank you and uh
representative

02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:45:31.950 --> 02:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes thank you madam Sher for
 
02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you uh Miss
 
02:45:40.830 --> 02:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
Daisy for uh uh taking it um so one of
 
02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
the things that we see in these hoarding
 
02:45:47.309 --> 02:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
cases is um uh when when when it gets
 
02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
Beyond a certain point is um real sort
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
of public horror and outrage at the
 
02:45:54.309 --> 02:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
conditions that the animals are are
 
02:45:59.910 --> 02:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
facing and uh often a rather than a
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
um uh a will on the part of the public
 
02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
to to look for a cure but a desire to
 
02:46:09.309 --> 02:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
look for punishment and I was wondering
 
02:46:14.190 --> 02:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
how that plays into the um the Practical
 
02:46:16.389 --> 02:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
aspects of trying to get uh treatment
 
02:46:20.710 --> 02:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
people yes representative Bixby
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think that we've all
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
heard of those those sort of horror
 
02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
stories if you will and of course not
 
02:46:36.750 --> 02:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
every case entails um that type of
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
severity um you know I of course want to
 
02:46:43.429 --> 02:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
recommend um that within the community
 
02:46:46.990 --> 02:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
providers are as proactive as possible
 
02:46:49.469 --> 02:46:49.479 align:start position:0%
um to ensure that a case doesn't reach
 
02:46:52.830 --> 02:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
that level of magnitude if if if that is
 
02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
possible in any way shape or form um I
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
can understand that the public would
 
02:47:02.830 --> 02:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
then want to pursue more punitive
 
02:47:05.710 --> 02:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
measures want to look for punishment
 
02:47:07.870 --> 02:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
within those circumstances because we
 
02:47:09.790 --> 02:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
are thinking about animals and we're
 
02:47:13.790 --> 02:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
thinking about their welfare right um
 
02:47:16.389 --> 02:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
but we also need to be mindful of course
 
02:47:19.830 --> 02:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
that this is a mental health concern as
 
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
well and thinking just within punitive
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
reivisa again they're going to
 
02:47:38.269 --> 02:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
accumulate more animals we're going to
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
see the same cycle occur over and over
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
and over again so thinking about full
 
02:47:47.389 --> 02:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
treatment and not just focusing on
 
02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
prohibition or just the symptoms of the
 
02:47:52.630 --> 02:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
problem which might be for seizures of
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
all of the animals for instance but
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
thinking about getting the person help
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
and whatever help is actually defined
 
02:48:02.790 --> 02:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
for that case think we're going to see a
 
02:48:04.950 --> 02:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
different outcome at least in my
 
02:48:06.910 --> 02:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
experience I've seen different outcomes
 
02:48:09.389 --> 02:48:09.399 align:start position:0%
as well as the experiences of some of my
 
02:48:09.399 --> 02:48:12.510 align:start position:0%
as well as the experiences of some of my
colleagues

02:48:12.510 --> 02:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
Nationwide okay um thank you very much
 
02:48:18.510 --> 02:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Daisy and I just wanted to in
 
02:48:20.670 --> 02:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
show that uh we are coming up in a heart
 
02:48:22.349 --> 02:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
break at 12
 
02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
o' um and I do know that uh Miss obber
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
still has her hand up so I would like to
 
02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
give her an opportunity just for a brief
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
moment to say what she would like to say
 
02:48:38.510 --> 02:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
and then uh if we have any further
 
02:48:40.429 --> 02:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
discussion we're going to have to take
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
that to another time so go ahead and it
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
is over thank thank you I appreciate all
 
02:48:49.269 --> 02:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
of you taking the time to hear the
 
02:48:53.349 --> 02:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
details about this uh problem and some
 
02:48:56.269 --> 02:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
proposed solutions to address it I I did
 
02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
want to share that I had a
 
02:49:02.190 --> 02:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
conversation uh probably two months ago
 
02:49:06.389 --> 02:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
with a judge down in Baltimore Baltimore
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
Maryland who sits on a mental health
 
02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
court and she had a serious Animal
 
02:49:15.190 --> 02:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
Hoarding uh case that came before her
 
02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
and it prompted her uh she is in the
 
02:49:20.830 --> 02:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
middle of drafting a manual for judges
 
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
that would be a reference around best
 
02:49:25.389 --> 02:49:25.399 align:start position:0%
practices for any judge that might
 
02:49:28.269 --> 02:49:28.279 align:start position:0%
encounter an Animal Hoarding disorder
 
02:49:32.510 --> 02:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
case uh because in her um experience
 
02:49:34.349 --> 02:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
it's this is not the kind of case that
 
02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
you going to routinely see it may be in
 
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
the um over your career as a judge you
 
02:49:43.590 --> 02:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
may only end up having you know one case
 
02:49:46.070 --> 02:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
come before you so she's publishing this
 
02:49:48.990 --> 02:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
manual uh soon and I just wanted to
 
02:49:51.550 --> 02:49:51.560 align:start position:0%
acknowledge in New Hampshire I do
 
02:49:54.030 --> 02:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
understand that you have uh mental
 
02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
health drug Courts for those suffering
 
02:49:59.590 --> 02:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
from substance use disorder and I know
 
02:50:02.910 --> 02:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
that um last year there had been a
 
02:50:04.429 --> 02:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
commission in New Hampshire to look at
 
02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
expanding mental health courts in your
 
02:50:09.070 --> 02:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
state which are really designed to be
 
02:50:11.229 --> 02:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
problemsolving courts that would allow
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
the kind of oversight and followup that
 
02:50:16.030 --> 02:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
I think everyone is acknow in would be a
 
02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
crucial element to any uh approach in
 
02:50:21.870 --> 02:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
treating somebody with this disorder but
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps it is developmental in first uh
 
02:50:28.469 --> 02:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
enacting some language like House Bill
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
366 to again raise awareness and help
 
02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
educate the judges in New Hampshire um
 
02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
and the the criminal justice system that
 
02:50:40.150 --> 02:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
in fact this may be um a result of of
 
02:50:41.870 --> 02:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
Animal Hoarding disorder you know that
 
02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
has created these charges coming forward
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
and to best respond thank you well thank
 
02:50:50.429 --> 02:50:50.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you so very much for those
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%

03:56:22.189 --> 03:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
little town of 300 of
 
03:56:25.469 --> 03:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
Randolph so Whitefield is my largest
 
03:56:28.830 --> 03:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
town that I represent and I paid close
 
03:56:31.269 --> 03:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
attention last year when their town
 
03:56:33.630 --> 03:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
meeting in
 
03:56:36.870 --> 03:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
20120 uh on a petitioned ward article
 
03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:37.670 align:start position:0%
20120 uh on a petitioned ward article
number

03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:56:44.070 --> 03:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
40 voted uh handily to be opposed to
 
03:56:48.269 --> 03:56:48.279 align:start position:0%
having a landfill in their town near
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake State
 
03:56:55.429 --> 03:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
Park and when I was asked later to by
 
03:56:59.149 --> 03:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
people enthusiastic about uh prohibiting
 
03:57:02.110 --> 03:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
a landfill within two miles of state
 
03:57:04.189 --> 03:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
parks in New Hampshire to be the prime
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor I was more than happy to agree
 
03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
and I think what's important to
 
03:57:15.469 --> 03:57:15.479 align:start position:0%
recognize about my district and much of
 
03:57:19.269 --> 03:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
Coos County is that we are increasingly
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
a tourist based economy I in my district
 
03:57:29.070 --> 03:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
have two grand hotels the Omni Mount
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
Washington in Breton woods and the
 
03:57:36.349 --> 03:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
mountain view grand in
 
03:57:38.670 --> 03:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
Whitefield then in addition to those
 
03:57:42.030 --> 03:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
those great big hotels that ordinarily
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
when we don't have a pandemic truly hire
 
03:57:48.309 --> 03:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people through the year we
 
03:57:53.309 --> 03:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
have Mom and Pop restaurants cabins
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
motels and although people are trying
 
03:58:00.389 --> 03:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
to uh develop and continue with
 
03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturing it's a hard push in Coos
 
03:58:07.349 --> 03:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
where we're so far away from uh
 
03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
metropolitan areas
 
03:58:09.120 --> 03:58:10.030 align:start position:0%
metropolitan areas
so

03:58:10.030 --> 03:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:13.429 --> 03:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
tourism has become more and more
 
03:58:17.510 --> 03:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
important so the idea of having a state
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
park become the site right next to it of
 
03:58:26.229 --> 03:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
a landfill is just
 
03:58:29.790 --> 03:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
startling this particular Park is one of
 
03:58:34.149 --> 03:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
the 35 uh 10 uh parks that were the
 
03:58:36.910 --> 03:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
first parks that were bought by New
 
03:58:41.389 --> 03:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 193 35 and it's a Charming
 
03:58:41.399 --> 03:58:43.429 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 193 35 and it's a Charming
Park

03:58:43.429 --> 03:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
Park
 
03:58:46.630 --> 03:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
um people who know about landfills and
 
03:58:50.750 --> 03:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
have visited them as I have uh know that
 
03:58:54.269 --> 03:58:54.279 align:start position:0%
even those that are well-run there is
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
odor there's Trucking there's
 
03:59:02.110 --> 03:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
noise and there's cleared land to open
 
03:59:03.189 --> 03:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
up the
 
03:59:05.950 --> 03:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
landfills and it's not something you
 
03:59:09.030 --> 03:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
want in a tourist area and not something
 
03:59:11.950 --> 03:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
you want next to a state
 
03:59:16.750 --> 03:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
park uh people in Whitefield believe
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
that they will have gears of
 
03:59:23.790 --> 03:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
degradation and really no particular
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
return to the town itself and that is
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
why the selectman sent a letter to the
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
governor executive counsel senators and
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
representatives asking that such a bill
 
03:59:45.309 --> 03:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
as this uh and be done be passed so that
 
03:59:48.149 --> 03:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
this would not happen in their town so I
 
03:59:51.070 --> 03:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
am here really at the behest of the
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and the town meeting of
 
03:59:57.309 --> 03:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
Whitefield it's not just a few people
 
03:59:59.309 --> 03:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
who live in a particular spot in
 
04:00:01.870 --> 04:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
Whitefield it is the town of Whitefield
 
04:00:05.790 --> 04:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
itself and their Selectmen that want
 
04:00:10.149 --> 04:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
this uh landfill not to happen there
 
04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
this morning as I understand it I was at
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
ways and means but um our uh Taylor
 
04:00:20.550 --> 04:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
Caswell was on the exchange and
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
apparently he came out against having
 
04:00:23.040 --> 04:00:23.950 align:start position:0%
apparently he came out against having
this

04:00:23.950 --> 04:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:00:27.510 --> 04:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
landfill uh in Whitefield in that part
 
04:00:31.590 --> 04:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
of Coos County because he sees
 
04:00:35.389 --> 04:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
that the pandemic has made us even more
 
04:00:38.750 --> 04:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
aware that people want to be outdoors
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
they want beautiful places to go they
 
04:00:46.070 --> 04:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
want to have a places where people can
 
04:00:49.590 --> 04:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
live and work and play and have a
 
04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
balanced life and as you probably know
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
they had a ability to hire a new person
 
04:01:01.750 --> 04:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
to be sort of in charge of promoting
 
04:01:05.070 --> 04:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
outdoors in New Hampshire in a much more
 
04:01:08.590 --> 04:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and organized way and
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
they've just gotten permission to go
 
04:01:14.229 --> 04:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
ahead and hire such a person so as you
 
04:01:17.389 --> 04:01:17.399 align:start position:0%
may know Taylor Caswell himself uh comes
 
04:01:20.830 --> 04:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
from Littleton he knows the area he
 
04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
knows what it can support and can be
 
04:01:27.790 --> 04:01:27.800 align:start position:0%
developed here in a sustainable economy
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
the other person who is also very
 
04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
interested in this park because he
 
04:01:37.389 --> 04:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
believes that in the almost 400 Acres
 
04:01:41.149 --> 04:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
there is place for a state campground to
 
04:01:44.229 --> 04:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
be built on the existing state park and
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's Phil Bryce another person who
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
spent a good bit of his life in the
 
04:01:53.070 --> 04:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
North Country he was a Forester when I
 
04:01:58.389 --> 04:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
first met him uh at Crown Vantage the uh
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
Pulp and Paper company that of course is
 
04:02:05.990 --> 04:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
no longer uh part of the Berlin scene he
 
04:02:08.790 --> 04:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
then went to work forest and lands
 
04:02:11.189 --> 04:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
then he left for Private Industry came
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
back and now is director of parks and he
 
04:02:18.189 --> 04:02:18.199 align:start position:0%
knows this park and he knows what can
 
04:02:22.269 --> 04:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
happen for the good in the North Country
 
04:02:24.670 --> 04:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
so I think it's interesting that these
 
04:02:27.630 --> 04:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
two people who are in the state's
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
employee and interested in the economy
 
04:02:36.750 --> 04:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
are both people who see that a landfill
 
04:02:38.830 --> 04:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
would not be a good thing
 
04:02:41.950 --> 04:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
to have at this state park and I think
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
although I have not personally been to
 
04:02:46.469 --> 04:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
every state park by any means in New
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think that the idea of a
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
two- mile buffer around our state parks
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
in which landfills could not be cited is
 
04:02:56.910 --> 04:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
a perfectly
 
04:02:56.920 --> 04:02:58.630 align:start position:0%
a perfectly
reasonable

04:02:58.630 --> 04:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh thought it's not as much as some
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
people would like it to be but I think
 
04:03:08.590 --> 04:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
it would protect
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh the investment and
 
04:03:16.750 --> 04:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
the Really the appeal of our Park system
 
04:03:19.710 --> 04:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
to have such a
 
04:03:19.720 --> 04:03:21.389 align:start position:0%
to have such a
provision

04:03:21.389 --> 04:03:21.399 align:start position:0%
provision
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I
 
04:03:27.469 --> 04:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
really I very much would like to see
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:03:31.309 --> 04:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
passed uh I think it's a better Bill
 
04:03:34.149 --> 04:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
actually than passed the house last year
 
04:03:36.429 --> 04:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
and then died through
 
04:03:39.070 --> 04:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
the uh pandemic
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
it is a simpler bill it doesn't bring up
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
any federal land issues which uh the
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
previous Bill did so I think the
 
04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
Simplicity of this one is to the good
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I very much would ask that you give
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
real consideration to passing this I
 
04:04:03.030 --> 04:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
think it's an excellent Bill I'm very
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
proud to be the prime sponsor and I'm
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
ready to answer any questions that you
 
04:04:09.550 --> 04:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
might have
 
04:04:11.950 --> 04:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%

representative B thank you Mr chair and
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tucker for
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you talked a
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
little bit about how state parks in New
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tend to bring in a lot of
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
Tourism uh my state park of choice is
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
White Lake in Tam and every time I go
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
there I notice that a lot of uh I'm
 
04:04:34.030 --> 04:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
sorry that more than half the cars in
 
04:04:36.189 --> 04:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
the parking lot have Massachusetts
 
04:04:39.469 --> 04:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
license plates people Massachusetts are
 
04:04:41.950 --> 04:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
going to drive two or even three hours
 
04:04:46.830 --> 04:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
especially what I didn't hear the
 
04:04:53.309 --> 04:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
question I heard that that you have a
 
04:04:55.149 --> 04:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
park in Tamworth and you see a lot of
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts plates I'm having a little
 
04:05:00.110 --> 04:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
trouble actually hearing the question
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative would you be able to
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
repeat that yeah can you hear me any
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
better now representative Tucker I I
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
think so okay maybe pull the mic a
 
04:05:08.800 --> 04:05:09.510 align:start position:0%
think so okay maybe pull the mic a
little

04:05:09.510 --> 04:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:05:12.510 --> 04:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
B if I just hear the actual question
 
04:05:15.149 --> 04:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
that you're asking yeah I've noticed
 
04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
that a lot of um residents of
 
04:05:19.149 --> 04:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts are willing to drive two
 
04:05:21.790 --> 04:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
or three hours up to our parks in the
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
North country and I'm wondering why you
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
think that is that they're willing to
 
04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
drive so far those
 
04:05:30.429 --> 04:05:30.439 align:start position:0%
Parks well I think one of the reasons is
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
that the parks the state parks are not
 
04:05:39.070 --> 04:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
really overdeveloped state parks um not
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
that there aren't very nice campgrounds
 
04:05:45.630 --> 04:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
nice Trails but they're pretty simple
 
04:05:47.309 --> 04:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what people are
 
04:05:51.630 --> 04:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
looking for now it's it's a um desire to
 
04:05:57.070 --> 04:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
go back in time um I've been I was not a
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
yearr round resident for many many years
 
04:06:02.590 --> 04:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
in Randolph my family came here in the
 
04:06:04.830 --> 04:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
Summers uh my
 
04:06:07.229 --> 04:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
grandfather uh mapped the White
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
Mountains for the Appalachian Mountain
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
Club LS F cutter and the fam's been
 
04:06:14.910 --> 04:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
coming from around the world to New
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the Summers and still does
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
I think that New Hampshire has kept a
 
04:06:25.870 --> 04:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
Simplicity about its parks that are very
 
04:06:25.880 --> 04:06:27.070 align:start position:0%
Simplicity about its parks that are very
very

04:06:27.070 --> 04:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
appealing and farest lake is one of
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
those Parks it's
 
04:06:37.469 --> 04:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
um very simple park I think the idea of
 
04:06:41.830 --> 04:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
a Campground there is excellent and I'm
 
04:06:45.309 --> 04:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
sure that if he has his way uh director
 
04:06:51.469 --> 04:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:54.389 --> 04:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
happens yeah thank you for taking my
 
04:06:57.070 --> 04:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
followup um I imagine that these people
 
04:06:59.110 --> 04:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
tend to spend the weekend or maybe even
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
a whole week when they visit these Parks
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
because they're driving so far and to
 
04:07:06.590 --> 04:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
stay in local hotels in the North
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
country and they spend probably
 
04:07:10.229 --> 04:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of money going out
 
04:07:12.149 --> 04:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
to eat and so on I know a l of people
 
04:07:13.630 --> 04:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
that are going to testify today are
 
04:07:16.149 --> 04:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh small new campure
 
04:07:19.149 --> 04:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
businesses could you articulate at all
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
the economic toll that small businesses
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
in an area like Dalton or Whitefield
 
04:07:27.790 --> 04:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
would take if tourists stopped coming to
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
a particular area because it developed
 
04:07:33.109 --> 04:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
maybe a bad reputation due to let's say
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
a pervasive
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
follower well I think that um
 
04:07:41.149 --> 04:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
I I think that the restaurants like
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
Grandma's Kitchen in in Whitefield which
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
is having a tough time during the
 
04:07:48.750 --> 04:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic but it's a delightful
 
04:07:50.830 --> 04:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant where everything is home you
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
know cooked from scratch in the kitchen
 
04:07:55.429 --> 04:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
and the prices are right it's a
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
cross-section of people locals and
 
04:08:02.070 --> 04:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
tourists who stop and uh those little
 
04:08:05.149 --> 04:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
businesses where people have an
 
04:08:08.189 --> 04:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial chance uh
 
04:08:12.630 --> 04:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
um really add to the feeling that you're
 
04:08:15.950 --> 04:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
moving back in time on the other hand
 
04:08:17.950 --> 04:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
the other end of the spectrum where the
 
04:08:20.950 --> 04:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
mountain view grand has conventions and
 
04:08:23.870 --> 04:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
weddings the omy Mount Washington you
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
know they will have four and five
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
weddings going in different sections of
 
04:08:31.870 --> 04:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
the hotel at once uh I've been a
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
reporter up here and I've covered a lot
 
04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
of events and you know the the primary
 
04:08:38.910 --> 04:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
season is
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
fun uh in the summer before the
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
primaries and so people like the fact
 
04:08:45.920 --> 04:08:46.830 align:start position:0%
primaries and so people like the fact
that

04:08:46.830 --> 04:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
there's high high uh cost great luxury
 
04:08:57.109 --> 04:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
really a beautiful setting and for
 
04:08:59.149 --> 04:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
things like weddings and
 
04:08:59.159 --> 04:09:00.710 align:start position:0%
things like weddings and
reunions

04:09:00.710 --> 04:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
reunions
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
there things like the Mount Washington
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh Cog Railway or the auto Road there's
 
04:09:12.109 --> 04:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
a lot to do that is some of them are
 
04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
walking in the woods that cost nothing
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
or a parking fee if it's a national
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
forest uh and others are um you know
 
04:09:24.670 --> 04:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
there's there simple and this costly and
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
I think people like
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
that uh jux
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
Theos and it um it interests me that I'm
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
sorry that I was at Ways and Means and
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
didn't get to hear uh
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Caswell talk about his
 
04:09:48.590 --> 04:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts for uh developing our economy
 
04:09:51.149 --> 04:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
more into the outdoors but I do think
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
that's something that one of the few
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
things that we can say that has happened
 
04:09:58.750 --> 04:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
that because of the pandemic that was
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
good and that is that people became more
 
04:10:06.030 --> 04:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
aware that they need to be outdoors they
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
need nature
 
04:10:10.590 --> 04:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:10:14.950 --> 04:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
supports really this bill and
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh but I it's a tremendous amount
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
of tourism in Coos sad to see the Mills
 
04:10:27.349 --> 04:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
go those were a way of life and terrific
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
jobs but those particular kind of jobs
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
are not going to come
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
back all right thank you
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:45.070 --> 04:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
recogniz today I do have a question
 
04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
though you know
 
04:10:50.710 --> 04:10:50.720 align:start position:0%

04:10:54.189 --> 04:10:54.199 align:start position:0%

that's good so you mentioned that uh you
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
know we have a significant number of
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
hotels uh some of them rather large and
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
we also have you know so many um
 
04:11:18.389 --> 04:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
tourists that come up to the North
 
04:11:21.790 --> 04:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
Country on a regular basis uh they stay
 
04:11:23.309 --> 04:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
the weekend and
 
04:11:26.910 --> 04:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
whatnot do you have an idea how much
 
04:11:32.070 --> 04:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
trash is uh produced by the tourists or
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
by the hotels in the North
 
04:11:39.149 --> 04:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
Country they do have there is trash and
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
fortunately uh two of the towns that I
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
represent are members of the Andre kogen
 
04:11:50.349 --> 04:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
Valley uh Regional Refuge disposal
 
04:11:53.710 --> 04:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
District I always remember forget so
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
Berlin dummer Errol gorum Jefferson
 
04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
milin North umberland Randolph and
 
04:12:06.830 --> 04:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
Stark uh are in a Consortium of towns
 
04:12:11.469 --> 04:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
that run on a major landfill in the
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
unincorporated place of
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
success and it's way up there and a lot
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
of outof State trash as well as trash
 
04:12:28.189 --> 04:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
from various locations in Coos County go
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
there and it
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
is has enough space to be
 
04:12:37.630 --> 04:12:37.640 align:start position:0%
permitted uh for a long time in in the
 
04:12:40.429 --> 04:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
future it's a huge
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
Enterprise in order to have
 
04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing because we still do have
 
04:12:47.070 --> 04:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
one paper mill in
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
gorum and I think people still hope that
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
there will be Manufacturing in the
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
future you do need to have
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
landfills uh I think we
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
all regret that we don't do more
 
04:13:01.710 --> 04:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
Recycling and
 
04:13:04.830 --> 04:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
reuse and reduction
 
04:13:09.109 --> 04:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
of materials but there is a very
 
04:13:09.119 --> 04:13:10.710 align:start position:0%
of materials but there is a very
substantial

04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
landfill in Coos County in success and
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's run by the city of Berlin and all
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
these little towns each member each Town
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
member of city has one vote so it it's
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
really kind of an example of how
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities got together to do an a
 
04:13:37.950 --> 04:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
commercial but not for profit
 
04:13:37.960 --> 04:13:41.149 align:start position:0%
commercial but not for profit

04:13:43.130 --> 04:13:43.140 align:start position:0%
landfill thank you
 
04:13:43.140 --> 04:13:44.910 align:start position:0%
landfill thank you

[Music]
 
04:13:48.950 --> 04:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative representative B another
 
04:13:51.149 --> 04:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
question yes I do thanks for taking my
 
04:13:53.109 --> 04:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
question and thank you again represent
 
04:13:57.030 --> 04:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
Tucker for for taking my question um you
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there's a landfill in
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
Success New Hampshire I think that's
 
04:14:02.950 --> 04:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
Mount carbury if I'm not mistaken how
 
04:14:05.109 --> 04:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
did this Bill affect mount
 
04:14:08.670 --> 04:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
carbury it doesn't affect Mount cury and
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
this is one of the reasons you'll see
 
04:14:14.750 --> 04:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
that uh representative laflam and
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative um hatch are
 
04:14:21.550 --> 04:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors uh because one is from
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
Berlin and one is from gorm and there
 
04:14:27.670 --> 04:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
was concern last year
 
04:14:30.750 --> 04:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
because the bill last year mentioned the
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Trail and although you would
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
never know it if you went to mount
 
04:14:38.750 --> 04:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
carbury which I have taken the grand
 
04:14:42.630 --> 04:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
tour a couple of times uh but not that
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
far behind Mount carbury up uh
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
Topography is
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
um is the appalation trail and because
 
04:14:58.269 --> 04:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
of the topography you would never
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
realize that one was as close to the
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
other and people uh who worry about
 
04:15:08.189 --> 04:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
permitting for the future were concerned
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
about last year's
 
04:15:13.870 --> 04:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
bill and I was a little concerned
 
04:15:16.590 --> 04:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
because I think if you don't need to
 
04:15:19.389 --> 04:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
involve Federal entities it's better not
 
04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
to because it makes it more difficult so
 
04:15:26.109 --> 04:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
this year's Bill only mentions the state
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
does not try to take in Appalachian
 
04:15:31.630 --> 04:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
Trail does not try to take in the White
 
04:15:32.910 --> 04:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
Mountain National
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
Forest uh that makes a lot more
 
04:15:36.159 --> 04:15:38.870 align:start position:0%
Forest uh that makes a lot more
complicated

04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
04:15:41.309 --> 04:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
Arrangements thank you
 
04:15:44.269 --> 04:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative any other questions for
 
04:15:44.279 --> 04:15:47.429 align:start position:0%
representative any other questions for
representative

04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
Tucker I see one all right
 
04:15:54.070 --> 04:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:15:56.109 --> 04:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tucker for for
 
04:15:58.590 --> 04:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I I I understand
 
04:16:01.389 --> 04:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill but as I listen
 
04:16:04.590 --> 04:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
to your testimony it seems that the
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
intent is to protect private business in
 
04:16:10.389 --> 04:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
the North Country right so we're going
 
04:16:13.349 --> 04:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
to protect the state park so that we
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
continue to attract tourists to engage
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
in Commerce and support local
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
businesses so I guess the the question
 
04:16:27.189 --> 04:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
is why doesn't the bill include
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
protections for existing private
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
businesses in the North Country so if I
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
if I owned and operated a hotel or a
 
04:16:40.510 --> 04:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
motel in North Country and the landfill
 
04:16:43.630 --> 04:16:43.640 align:start position:0%
got permitted next door to my business
 
04:16:46.469 --> 04:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
um you know I I could I'm sympathetic to
 
04:16:48.510 --> 04:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
your your argument that that could be
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
detrimental if not disastrous to my
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
business so why is there no protection
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
in the bill for uh local businesses or
 
04:17:01.790 --> 04:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
or even private
 
04:17:04.510 --> 04:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners well I think that
 
04:17:07.630 --> 04:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
traditionally uh those kinds of
 
04:17:11.950 --> 04:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
protections have come through zoning or
 
04:17:14.109 --> 04:17:14.119 align:start position:0%
land regulation
 
04:17:17.469 --> 04:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
ordinances um Dalton has not chosen
 
04:17:19.950 --> 04:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
until recently to go that particular
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
route each town of course or city has
 
04:17:27.630 --> 04:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to adopt within a
 
04:17:31.750 --> 04:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
framework um land protection Dalton did
 
04:17:35.229 --> 04:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
not choose to do that
 
04:17:39.710 --> 04:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
and uh so Whitefield is the next town to
 
04:17:46.990 --> 04:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
it and they have uh the state park
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be unfortunate
 
04:17:55.109 --> 04:17:55.119 align:start position:0%
to have that Park degraded and it really
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
seemed to be the only way that that kind
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
of protection could happen the omn Mount
 
04:18:05.550 --> 04:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
Washington over the years has assisted
 
04:18:10.750 --> 04:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
in or organizing protections for their
 
04:18:14.349 --> 04:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
viewshed uh lots of additions to the
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
White Mountain National Forest so that
 
04:18:19.550 --> 04:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
those kind of protections could happen
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
so I think the general protection of
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
businesses and Residences are done on a
 
04:18:30.389 --> 04:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
Town by town city by City
 
04:18:33.229 --> 04:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
basis I think pretty much through New
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
England through through zoning
 
04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances so I don't think it's that we
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
aren't people aren't doing that if they
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
live in a town where there is protection
 
04:18:49.790 --> 04:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
but I think this is a separate
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
problem maybe I'm not being articulate
 
04:18:52.319 --> 04:18:53.349 align:start position:0%
problem maybe I'm not being articulate
about

04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:18:56.790 --> 04:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
that yeah follow up if I may Mr chairman
 
04:18:56.800 --> 04:18:58.309 align:start position:0%
that yeah follow up if I may Mr chairman
go

04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:19:01.389 --> 04:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah so so I understand your your
 
04:19:03.870 --> 04:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
answer and I I tend to agree that these
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
these types of things are supposed to be
 
04:19:09.309 --> 04:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
um addressed by by local zoning
 
04:19:13.389 --> 04:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
ordinances if a community chooses so I I
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
guess we're we're looking at a bill
 
04:19:14.880 --> 04:19:16.109 align:start position:0%
guess we're we're looking at a bill
that's

04:19:16.109 --> 04:19:16.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
imposing one Community zoning onto
 
04:19:20.830 --> 04:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
another Community that's chosen not to
 
04:19:22.590 --> 04:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
do the zoning but that's that's not my
 
04:19:25.990 --> 04:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
my question my my question
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
is and I have to admit I haven't I
 
04:19:32.149 --> 04:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't walked the site but
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
say that
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
the yeah I have not so you say that the
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Trail is close to you know
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
another landfill but you would never
 
04:19:44.670 --> 04:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
know the proximity so I guess could you
 
04:19:46.950 --> 04:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
explain to me how it is that the
 
04:19:49.710 --> 04:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
proximal location of the landfill um
 
04:19:52.030 --> 04:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
would degrade the the state park
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
property that apparently is essentially
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
not developed at this point uh and and
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
how that couldn't be uh mitigated with u
 
04:20:03.109 --> 04:20:03.119 align:start position:0%
you know a green zone a buffer a barrier
 
04:20:05.429 --> 04:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh you know of green which is uh quite
 
04:20:07.389 --> 04:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
common in Forestry applications where
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
they clearcut near a road they'll leave
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
20 ft of trees between the road and the
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
clearcut so that it's not obvious from
 
04:20:13.479 --> 04:20:15.389 align:start position:0%
clearcut so that it's not obvious from
the

04:20:15.389 --> 04:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
road yes the well the the size of Mount
 
04:20:22.870 --> 04:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
carbur is I I can't remember how many
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
acres is is just absolutely enormous and
 
04:20:29.550 --> 04:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
the Appalachian Trail is much higher and
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh is heading towards I can't remember
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's actually in Maine or just
 
04:20:39.030 --> 04:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
about in Maine where would be uh not all
 
04:20:44.070 --> 04:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
that far from success it's really a much
 
04:20:48.750 --> 04:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
Wilder area and much greater topography
 
04:20:54.590 --> 04:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
differences in uh at success the way uh
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake works it's it's not that
 
04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
deep a lake and the
 
04:21:01.960 --> 04:21:03.630 align:start position:0%
deep a lake and the
surrounding

04:21:03.630 --> 04:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
surrounding
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hills uh aren't that high so it really
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
would uh there is someone who has put
 
04:21:14.429 --> 04:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
together some
 
04:21:17.870 --> 04:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
photoshopped uh photographs that show
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
how the landfill if developed would
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
actually impact the lake and he may be
 
04:21:29.550 --> 04:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh testifying this afternoon I don't
 
04:21:33.309 --> 04:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
know but someone has actually done that
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
work and the it's not
 
04:21:40.229 --> 04:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
that much difference in
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
elevation so that it actually would from
 
04:21:44.229 --> 04:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
this Shallow
 
04:21:47.990 --> 04:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
Lake where the land fillers proposed
 
04:21:51.750 --> 04:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
would definitely show and the trucks and
 
04:21:55.309 --> 04:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
the trucking and the noise and the
 
04:21:55.319 --> 04:21:56.870 align:start position:0%
the trucking and the noise and the
scavenger

04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
scavenger
 
04:22:01.790 --> 04:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
animals um which are a lot of birds that
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
come to
 
04:22:03.439 --> 04:22:05.349 align:start position:0%

landfills

04:22:08.670 --> 04:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:11.950 --> 04:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
at some of some of these landfills
 
04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
actually hire people to shoot guns off
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
to make noise to scatter those
 
04:22:19.080 --> 04:22:20.830 align:start position:0%
to make noise to scatter those
birds

04:22:20.830 --> 04:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
birds
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
um landfills now are covered every
 
04:22:28.349 --> 04:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon or evening so that they don't
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
still have the be populations that
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
people used to have at smaller back when
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
we had dumps and uh but I think that at
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
farest Lake there's no question that the
 
04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
surrounding areas that would be
 
04:22:51.870 --> 04:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
developed into a landfill would affect
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
what happens at the park itself what
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
kind of Park experience you would
 
04:22:57.520 --> 04:22:59.990 align:start position:0%
kind of Park experience you would
actually

04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative Tucker I
 
04:23:04.189 --> 04:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I'll be sure to visit the
 
04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh the site this weekend thank you Mr
 
04:23:06.080 --> 04:23:10.950 align:start position:0%
uh the site this weekend thank you Mr
chair

04:23:10.950 --> 04:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
you chair and thank you represent Tucker
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um we just talked
 
04:23:19.710 --> 04:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the appalation trail
 
04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
I've never hyped it myself um believe or
 
04:23:25.950 --> 04:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
not um but I I imagine that and correct
 
04:23:28.269 --> 04:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong hiking on a trail like
 
04:23:30.510 --> 04:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
that especially the Appalachian Trail
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
where you're kind of traversing a larger
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
area um that might be something where
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
you would
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
walk by the area that's kind of affected
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
by mount carbury in a relatively short
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
amount of time as you're moving down the
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
trail whereas a state park that that
 
04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
might be someplace you'd spend several
 
04:23:51.309 --> 04:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
hours whole day at you say that's
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
probably correct yeah maybe I haven't
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
describ I've actually never
 
04:23:59.590 --> 04:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
walked the that's part of the the mousk
 
04:24:02.189 --> 04:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
section which is supposed to be one of
 
04:24:05.109 --> 04:24:05.119 align:start position:0%
the most U difficult sections on the
 
04:24:09.510 --> 04:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Trail it's rugged and uh
 
04:24:11.149 --> 04:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
eventually it gets into Boulders where
 
04:24:13.109 --> 04:24:13.119 align:start position:0%
there sort of like lemon squeezer
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
Boulders um I'm afraid my hiking days
 
04:24:20.229 --> 04:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
are lower elevation ones today I have
 
04:24:23.469 --> 04:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
hiked on the presidential range on the
 
04:24:23.479 --> 04:24:24.790 align:start position:0%
hiked on the presidential range on the
Appalachian

04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
Appalachian
 
04:24:28.269 --> 04:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
Trail uh but I have never done a through
 
04:24:34.429 --> 04:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
hike I might say our governor has um
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
but there is no no there is no
 
04:24:39.239 --> 04:24:40.790 align:start position:0%
but there is no no there is no
relationship

04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
04:24:44.590 --> 04:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
between the mount carbury and the actual
 
04:24:47.469 --> 04:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Trail and it has buffers on
 
04:24:51.389 --> 04:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
either side of it it's just that the
 
04:24:54.149 --> 04:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
amount of miles that was in last year's
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
Bill did would could have affected they
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
felt the permitting because
 
04:25:06.149 --> 04:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
they bought so much land to have prot
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
ction all around the landfills itself
 
04:25:12.269 --> 04:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
that the people who were involved with
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
Mount carbury felt it had the potential
 
04:25:18.429 --> 04:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
to be a problem but there is when you
 
04:25:20.750 --> 04:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
walk the Appalachian Trail through the
 
04:25:25.389 --> 04:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
musix you're totally unaware of Mount
 
04:25:28.189 --> 04:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
carbury thank you representative any
 
04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.159 --> 04:25:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
Tucker

04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
Tucker
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
St thank you Mr chair
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:25:42.349 --> 04:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
question uh I did a Google oversight
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
look at uh the Forest Lake State Park
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
do and uh it looks like there's Park is
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
about 397 Acres that's
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
correct I'm trying to figure where the
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
perspective landfill was supposed to go
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
in how many acres east west north south
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
can can you give us a description of um
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
where the landfill was to be positioned
 
04:26:14.030 --> 04:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
04:26:16.870 --> 04:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
park uh I I couldn't be the one to do
 
04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure there is someone who could
 
04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
who uh
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
because they they do have a place it's
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
in the town of
 
04:26:32.349 --> 04:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
Dalton and as you see part of the lake
 
04:26:34.269 --> 04:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
is in Whitefield and part of the lake is
 
04:26:34.279 --> 04:26:34.990 align:start position:0%
is in Whitefield and part of the lake is
in

04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:26:35.000 --> 04:26:38.510 align:start position:0%
in
Dalton

04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
um so I I cannot answer that perhaps
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
there'll be another person who
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
can if not I can certainly arrange to
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
have the answer to that question sent to
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you committee did you have a
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
follow up or because I think that the
 
04:26:57.870 --> 04:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
point I'd like to make on the answer
 
04:27:00.630 --> 04:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
although I will get you the details is I
 
04:27:03.309 --> 04:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
think that people came to realize that
 
04:27:05.149 --> 04:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
this is something that should apply to
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
every state Park and not specifically
 
04:27:11.790 --> 04:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
just to this one that the idea that of
 
04:27:13.950 --> 04:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
all the places you could have a landfill
 
04:27:16.429 --> 04:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you would have it next
 
04:27:20.670 --> 04:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
to a state park where people have
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
invested uh
 
04:27:27.630 --> 04:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
capital in and then
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for recreational
 
04:27:31.080 --> 04:27:32.990 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for recreational
purposes

04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:27:37.349 --> 04:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
is just doesn't really make sense and
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
so I although I've seen the maps I've
 
04:27:44.510 --> 04:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
seen the I I'm not able to describe it
 
04:27:44.520 --> 04:27:45.309 align:start position:0%
seen the I I'm not able to describe it
uh

04:27:45.309 --> 04:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
properly but I think that we need to
 
04:27:52.349 --> 04:27:52.359 align:start position:0%
move past just Forest Lake and think
 
04:27:55.870 --> 04:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
about other parks that we know and
 
04:27:59.630 --> 04:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
love uh there's one in Goram that I walk
 
04:28:03.710 --> 04:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
in uh moose Brook State Park
 
04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
and you know there are a lot of
 
04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
lot of parks around
 
04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
that I think would want this
 
04:28:15.389 --> 04:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
protection thank you representa any
 
04:28:17.910 --> 04:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
additional questions for representative
 
04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
Tucker you've been very generous with
 
04:28:20.159 --> 04:28:20.910 align:start position:0%
Tucker you've been very generous with
your

04:28:20.910 --> 04:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:28:22.750 --> 04:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative we
 
04:28:24.910 --> 04:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thank you very
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
much for having
 
04:28:30.830 --> 04:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
me all right so we have 25 additional
 
04:28:34.149 --> 04:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
speakers signed up
 
04:28:37.590 --> 04:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
and two more hours roughly that I've
 
04:28:40.030 --> 04:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
allotted for the hearing so I think what
 
04:28:42.269 --> 04:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do is is ask
 
04:28:44.750 --> 04:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
everyone to try andit themselves to a
 
04:28:47.910 --> 04:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
voluntary thre minute uh time on their
 
04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
speech I'm going to leave it voluntary
 
04:28:51.309 --> 04:28:51.319 align:start position:0%
right this minute and we'll get through
 
04:28:53.070 --> 04:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
a few speakers and see how well we all
 
04:28:55.269 --> 04:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
do if we're not doing well adhering to
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
it I'm going to have to make it a
 
04:28:57.910 --> 04:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory three minutes because we're
 
04:29:00.429 --> 04:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
going to be uh running really long if we
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't so let's all uh try and be
 
04:29:04.109 --> 04:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
respectful of everyone's time and the
 
04:29:05.269 --> 04:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
fact that there's several more people
 
04:29:08.349 --> 04:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
coming behind you so what I'll ask of
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
everyone that I bring up I just need to
 
04:29:11.790 --> 04:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
to state your name I'll introduce your
 
04:29:14.030 --> 04:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
name just state where you uh where
 
04:29:15.389 --> 04:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
you're calling from the state that you
 
04:29:17.670 --> 04:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
live in so that we can uh the committee
 
04:29:20.030 --> 04:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
can know where you're coming from I'll
 
04:29:22.349 --> 04:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
do my best to uh get through the list
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to pick through and kind of
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
go every other person as I can I put a
 
04:29:28.950 --> 04:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
couple of folks up in the first three or
 
04:29:30.189 --> 04:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
four slots that are going to I know
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to present a lot of good
 
04:29:32.910 --> 04:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
technical information that I think will
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
help the committee to ask better
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
questions of the people people that
 
04:29:36.159 --> 04:29:37.670 align:start position:0%
questions of the people people that
testify

04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%

04:30:07.229 --> 04:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
me uh hello my name is Tim White um
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
calling from Vermont and uh I would want
 
04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
to thank the committee for the
 
04:30:16.750 --> 04:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide information to uh
 
04:30:18.309 --> 04:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
to them regarding the proposed Granite
 
04:30:20.349 --> 04:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
State landfill project as it relates to
 
04:30:21.790 --> 04:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
177 I'm a hydrogeologist with sorn
 
04:30:26.269 --> 04:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
headen Associates and we're an
 
04:30:28.070 --> 04:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
engineering and geosciences consulting
 
04:30:30.630 --> 04:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
firm based in conquer I'm the Project
 
04:30:32.109 --> 04:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
Director for the hydrogeologic
 
04:30:33.750 --> 04:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
investigation at the proposed Granite
 
04:30:36.510 --> 04:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
State landfill and yesterday I submitted
 
04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
a letter to the committee summarizing
 
04:30:39.590 --> 04:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
some of the key findings from the
 
04:30:41.070 --> 04:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologic studies that have been
 
04:30:42.389 --> 04:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
performed at the site over the past
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
several years including an assessment of
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
the groundwater and surface water flow
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
directions the findings from the
 
04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
investigation indicate the site meets
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
the criteria that are contained in the
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire geologic sighting
 
04:30:56.550 --> 04:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
limitations and that the site's
 
04:30:58.269 --> 04:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
amendable for monitoring under a release
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
detection permit our hydrogeologic
 
04:31:02.469 --> 04:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
report will be an attachment to the
 
04:31:04.429 --> 04:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
forthcoming standard application for
 
04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste landfill
 
04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
and we're currently in the process of
 
04:31:09.469 --> 04:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
preparing a separate release detection
 
04:31:11.670 --> 04:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
permit application which will be
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
submitted to Dees for
 
04:31:16.149 --> 04:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
review today I wanted to follow on my
 
04:31:17.550 --> 04:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
letter to make myself available to
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
committee members to answer questions
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
they may have regarding groundwater and
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.560 --> 04:31:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
site

04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:40.750 --> 04:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
did we l
 
04:31:43.710 --> 04:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
you no I'm still here I I I just wanted
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
to make myself available uh if committee
 
04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
members uh had questions uh regarding
 
04:31:49.870 --> 04:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
groundwater and surface water at the
 
04:31:52.349 --> 04:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
proposed project site I'm sorry I guess
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
I writing that sound like we lost you uh
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
does the committee any other the
 
04:32:00.670 --> 04:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
committee have questions for Mr
 
04:32:00.680 --> 04:32:03.030 align:start position:0%
committee have questions for Mr
White

04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
White
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
stable thank you Mr chair thank for
 
04:32:08.830 --> 04:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question to the
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
previous speaker was how many acres the
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
proposed landfill is to be uh adjacent
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
to the Forest Lake State Park and how is
 
04:32:22.269 --> 04:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
it situated relative to the park in the
 
04:32:25.070 --> 04:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
lake is it Northeast south or west can
 
04:32:26.910 --> 04:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
you give us some
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
idea yes I think some of the um speakers
 
04:32:32.109 --> 04:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
following me can give some additional
 
04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
details as it's proposed uh the proposed
 
04:32:38.670 --> 04:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
landfill is approximately 137 acres and
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
it's situated west of Forest Lake State
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
Lake go ahead situated West that's
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
helpful how how far west would you say
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
relative to Forest Lake as a focal point
 
04:32:58.830 --> 04:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
um would the line the demarcation line
 
04:33:02.590 --> 04:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
be between the park and the adjacent
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
landf so the uh between the proposed
 
04:33:07.830 --> 04:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
site and Forest Lake there is a
 
04:33:10.670 --> 04:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
topographic Ridge that forms a surface
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
water divide between the two and water
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
east of that divide flows towards Forest
 
04:33:17.429 --> 04:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
Lake and west of that divide flows
 
04:33:19.310 --> 04:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
towards Alder Brook which is a tributary
 
04:33:22.269 --> 04:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
to the amusic river and so the landfill
 
04:33:25.230 --> 04:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
is west of that surface water divide I
 
04:33:28.269 --> 04:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
believe it's approximately a half a mile
 
04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
and I think I we can confirm that uh
 
04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
that distance with some of the design
 
04:33:37.150 --> 04:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
Engineers today that'll be speaking
 
04:33:40.349 --> 04:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:49.709 --> 04:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
question am looking at the
 
04:33:54.510 --> 04:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
that it appears to me that the
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater flow is away from Forest
 
04:34:02.189 --> 04:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
Lake and away from the state park so um
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
because of that topographic Ridge so so
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
in your professional opinion do you
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
foresee any way in which uh groundwater
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
would be contaminated going to Forest
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
Lake or to the state
 
04:34:20.189 --> 04:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
park uh so that's a that's a good
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
question U there the topographic divide
 
04:34:26.070 --> 04:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
that that forms a surface water divide
 
04:34:28.590 --> 04:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
has a related and underlying groundwater
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
divide along those topographically
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
higher areas and so the same just like
 
04:34:35.310 --> 04:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
surface water is divided groundwater is
 
04:34:37.470 --> 04:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
also divided and flows east of that
 
04:34:39.310 --> 04:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
divide flows to Forest Lake West of the
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
divide it flows to Alder Brook and so uh
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
groundwater cannot go above and over
 
04:34:48.189 --> 04:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
that divide it has to flow from from
 
04:34:50.269 --> 04:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
higher elevation groundwater to lower
 
04:34:52.510 --> 04:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
elevation groundwater can't flow in
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
reverse and in terms of contamination
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the solid waste Engineers will
 
04:35:00.789 --> 04:35:00.799 align:start position:0%
discuss this uh today but the the
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
landfill will be designed with a double
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
liner system to contain the the waste
 
04:35:11.590 --> 04:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
environment thank you any additional
 
04:35:18.029 --> 04:35:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
vvin thank you Mr chairman uh and thank
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
you Mr White for taking the question um
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
so would I am I correct in assuming that
 
04:35:36.349 --> 04:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
this facility is north of Route 116
 
04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:39.799 align:start position:0%
east of mantis Hill Drive and
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
approximately west of Douglas Drive is
 
04:35:47.629 --> 04:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
it in that general plot of land where
 
04:35:51.551 --> 04:35:51.561 align:start position:0%
the landfill would be located that is
 
04:35:53.629 --> 04:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
correct it's it's actually accessed by
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
Douglas Drive um off of Route north of
 
04:35:57.039 --> 04:35:59.349 align:start position:0%
Douglas Drive um off of Route north of
Route

04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:02.429 --> 04:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
116 excellent thank you Mr White thank
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
chairman representative
 
04:36:09.070 --> 04:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
dick yes thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:36:12.670 --> 04:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so uh you've
 
04:36:18.310 --> 04:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
testified that uh it is um unlikely that
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
there are going to be uh groundwater or
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
surface water impacts from the uh from
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
the land from a potential landfill there
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh on Forest Lake itself uh but does
 
04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
that mean that there would not be any
 
04:36:36.750 --> 04:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
sort of environmental impacts on Forest
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
Lake or is it just the ones just the
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
just the that particular aspect of
 
04:36:44.990 --> 04:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
hydrology that you don't see any impact
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the areas that I studi groundwater
 
04:36:50.109 --> 04:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
and surface water um and we looked at
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
this closely including areas around uh
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
the proposed landfill uh so my focus is
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
on groundwater and surface water and
 
04:37:00.269 --> 04:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
that's correct we we uh see that the
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
site is separated from the Forest Lake
 
04:37:09.029 --> 04:37:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
water you a power or you offet
 
04:37:14.490 --> 04:37:14.500 align:start position:0%
representative I'm all set
 
04:37:14.500 --> 04:37:15.670 align:start position:0%
representative I'm all set
[Music]

04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:37:20.349 --> 04:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
verbil thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question Mr
 
04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
White so I just want to make sure I'm
 
04:37:28.709 --> 04:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
I'm clear based on what I've heard
 
04:37:30.590 --> 04:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
before and what I'm hearing now so it's
 
04:37:32.830 --> 04:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding looking at the maps
 
04:37:37.590 --> 04:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
that the road access to the lake um any
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
road access to that lake is is a
 
04:37:43.269 --> 04:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
separate road than would be the road
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
used to access the landfill from Route
 
04:37:49.189 --> 04:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
116 that that's factually correct
 
04:37:52.709 --> 04:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
right uh that is that is correct the the
 
04:37:55.109 --> 04:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
site and the the property where the
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
landfill is proposed is access from
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
Douglas Drive and it's my understanding
 
04:38:01.830 --> 04:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
that that does not connect vehicular
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
access to force lake so that Force Lake
 
04:38:06.269 --> 04:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
would be accessed by other
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
roads thank you Mr White thank you Mr
 
04:38:13.470 --> 04:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
chairman any additional questions
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:38:17.590 --> 04:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr White for taking my
 
04:38:20.230 --> 04:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
question um I I went through your letter
 
04:38:22.470 --> 04:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
and I I heard your testimony and it it
 
04:38:24.269 --> 04:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
sounds like it makes some assertions
 
04:38:27.429 --> 04:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
about the groundwater divide and
 
04:38:30.750 --> 04:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
topographic in in the proposed site but
 
04:38:33.269 --> 04:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
all that info seems to be specific to
 
04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
this particular project
 
04:38:39.150 --> 04:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
um but that doesn't speak at all to the
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
general proposed policy based topic uh
 
04:38:43.629 --> 04:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
that HP
 
04:38:46.990 --> 04:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
177 uh contains which is creating a two-
 
04:38:49.869 --> 04:38:49.879 align:start position:0%
mile buffer around the state parks am I
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
right about
 
04:38:53.629 --> 04:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
that uh that's correct I'm I'm not a
 
04:38:56.629 --> 04:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
public policy expert so I what I did was
 
04:38:58.910 --> 04:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
I focused uh my information for the
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
committee on the areas that I was uh
 
04:39:03.869 --> 04:39:03.879 align:start position:0%
qualified to comment on the groundwater
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.119 --> 04:39:13.070 align:start position:0%
 
additional

04:39:13.070 --> 04:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.629 --> 04:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.840 --> 04:39:50.830 align:start position:0%

04:39:52.890 --> 04:39:52.900 align:start position:0%
Mr SW are you able to
 
04:39:52.900 --> 04:39:59.270 align:start position:0%
Mr SW are you able to
[Music]

04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
again can you hear me okay all right we
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
get you now go ahead sir thank you very
 
04:40:12.030 --> 04:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
much for taking my testimony today um I
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
did want to remind the committee that
 
04:40:17.708 --> 04:40:17.718 align:start position:0%
the the house bill 177 that you're
 
04:40:20.070 --> 04:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
considering today takes into account all
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state parks not just the
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake battle that we're uh engaged
 
04:40:29.948 --> 04:40:29.958 align:start position:0%
in currently um let's get to the point
 
04:40:31.550 --> 04:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
of what we're talking about here we're
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
talking about a garbage landfill being
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
cited next to one of the most valuable
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
economic engines for the State of New
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our state parks and our Great
 
04:40:47.628 --> 04:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
Outdoors so I hope that's not lost on
 
04:40:49.990 --> 04:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
the committee I understand the line of
 
04:40:52.510 --> 04:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
questioning and obviously the Forest
 
04:40:54.830 --> 04:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
Lake situation is at the heart of this
 
04:40:58.030 --> 04:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
bill currently but let's say in 20 30
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
year years from now when the turnkey
 
04:41:02.628 --> 04:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
landfill is closed in Rochester and
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
Waste Management needs a new spot what
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
state park could possibly be considered
 
04:41:11.910 --> 04:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
then and as far as the groundwater at
 
04:41:15.190 --> 04:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake the the developer the
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
applicant has already admitted that and
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
I've sent photographs to the uh drawings
 
04:41:24.110 --> 04:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
to the committee that this landfill
 
04:41:28.110 --> 04:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
which will take in 18.4 million tons of
 
04:41:31.110 --> 04:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
trash possibly half of it from out of
 
04:41:34.270 --> 04:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
state uh it will be buried in a mountain
 
04:41:37.230 --> 04:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
that ultimately will be visible from the
 
04:41:40.030 --> 04:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
water at Forest Lake so in 30 years from
 
04:41:43.110 --> 04:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
now when there is a mountain of toxic
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
trash Left Behind do you think visitors
 
04:41:48.670 --> 04:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
or and tourists are going want go going
 
04:41:52.750 --> 04:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
to want to go to Forest Lake State Park
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
and as for groundwater
 
04:41:59.070 --> 04:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
contamination my fear is atmospheric
 
04:42:00.708 --> 04:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
deposition I don't know if you're
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with that term but uh the waste
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
industry cites it
 
04:42:08.110 --> 04:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
uh that we're talking about atmospheric
 
04:42:09.708 --> 04:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
contamination I don't know if you're
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
aware but this past summer forest lake
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
suffered its first shutdown because of
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
the cyano bacteria that was an overload
 
04:42:20.830 --> 04:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
of nutrients um to the lake it's a very
 
04:42:24.350 --> 04:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
fragile Lake and Atmospheric deposition
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
from the landfill and the landfill by
 
04:42:29.788 --> 04:42:29.798 align:start position:0%
the way is upwind of the lake and the
 
04:42:32.110 --> 04:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
state park and we're talking landfill
 
04:42:34.910 --> 04:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
gases obviously odor and right now
 
04:42:36.670 --> 04:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
there's two class action suits in
 
04:42:39.310 --> 04:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and New York relative to
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
landfill odor 2.5 miles away and five
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
miles away so atmospheric deposition of
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
odor harmful harmful landfill gases feal
 
04:42:53.110 --> 04:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
contamination from seagulls and turkey
 
04:42:56.030 --> 04:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
vultures will have a dramatic impact on
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
the water quality of forest lake at
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake State Park and it is the
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
only public beach in the vicinity where
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
res residents of the area and tourists
 
04:43:09.670 --> 04:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
can come and access both the lake from a
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
beach and a public boat launch so if
 
04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
this if this one landfill is s permitted
 
04:43:21.150 --> 04:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
at Forest Lake I guarantee you that in
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
30 years this Lake will be lost I
 
04:43:27.150 --> 04:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
guarantee you because it is already
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
identified by the EPA as an impaired
 
04:43:34.750 --> 04:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
body of water due to the loading of
 
04:43:37.230 --> 04:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
pollutants particularly Mercury which is
 
04:43:40.350 --> 04:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
deposited via acid rain acid rain
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
atmospheric deposition and let's also
 
04:43:45.708 --> 04:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
consider the impact of 100 plus trucks
 
04:43:49.868 --> 04:43:49.878 align:start position:0%
going two and four from that facility a
 
04:43:52.430 --> 04:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
day that's a 100 trucks imagine the
 
04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
amount of dust that will be kicked up by
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
those trucks and the landfilling
 
04:43:59.628 --> 04:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
operations which will blow in the
 
04:44:02.910 --> 04:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
direction of the state park so um again
 
04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to stress to the Comm
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
committee the importance of all of our
 
04:44:09.070 --> 04:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
state parks and we're talking about a
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
landfill we're not talking about dollar
 
04:44:13.110 --> 04:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
stores we're not talking about Walmart
 
04:44:15.310 --> 04:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a garbage landfill
 
04:44:18.150 --> 04:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
being sighted next to a state park and
 
04:44:23.750 --> 04:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
two miles is not a uh a sacrifice it is
 
04:44:27.230 --> 04:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
a compromise to protect the Integrity of
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
our state park system from a project
 
04:44:33.788 --> 04:44:33.798 align:start position:0%
that no one would think has ever come to
 
04:44:35.470 --> 04:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
fruition and here we are in the
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
permitting process so thank you for
 
04:44:39.910 --> 04:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
listening to me I'll certainly take any
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Swan is there any
 
04:44:43.910 --> 04:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
 
04:44:46.948 --> 04:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
Swan representative thank you thank you
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Swan for
 
04:44:51.628 --> 04:44:51.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned
 
04:44:54.670 --> 04:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
seagulls um I I've visited some hiking
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
trails adjacent to the turnkey landfill
 
04:44:59.470 --> 04:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
and when I was there I noticed what what
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
honestly had to be I mean absolutely
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
countless seagull I I obviously couldn't
 
04:45:06.990 --> 04:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
count them but I would imagine thousands
 
04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
to tens of thousands of
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
Seagal is that there were swarming over
 
04:45:12.990 --> 04:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
the landfill is that kind of what you're
 
04:45:17.070 --> 04:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
talking about and um if so what kind of
 
04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
effect do you think that would have on
 
04:45:18.798 --> 04:45:20.670 align:start position:0%
effect do you think that would have on
Forest

04:45:20.670 --> 04:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
Forest
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
Lake well thank you for the question and
 
04:45:25.150 --> 04:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
I will say currently at Forest Lake
 
04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
State Park we have been at war with a
 
04:45:31.150 --> 04:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
family of about five geese because they
 
04:45:32.910 --> 04:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
like to hang out at the public beach so
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
we have a coyote decoy set up to try and
 
04:45:38.470 --> 04:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
scare them away because just the fact
 
04:45:41.470 --> 04:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
that those five geese are defecating in
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
the water it has we have had um um not
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
shutdowns but we have had concerns
 
04:45:53.070 --> 04:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
relative to a higher feal count as a as
 
04:45:57.270 --> 04:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
a result so imagine hundreds of Seagulls
 
04:46:00.430 --> 04:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
coming not only defecating but at the
 
04:46:01.948 --> 04:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
same time they're going to pose a
 
04:46:04.830 --> 04:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
significant threat to our very at and
 
04:46:08.230 --> 04:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
precious Lon population at the
 
04:46:14.910 --> 04:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
Ville yes thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
04:46:19.510 --> 04:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr Swan for taking the question I
 
04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have the answer and if
 
04:46:23.070 --> 04:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
you you don't perhaps somebody that
 
04:46:26.510 --> 04:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
follows you uh may have the question do
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
you have the number of uh non-local area
 
04:46:33.910 --> 04:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
visitors to Forest Lake State Park on an
 
04:46:33.920 --> 04:46:35.868 align:start position:0%
visitors to Forest Lake State Park on an
annual

04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
annual
 
04:46:38.030 --> 04:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
basis I don't actually have those
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
numbers because since it is a free park
 
04:46:42.548 --> 04:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
we don't there's no collecting of funds
 
04:46:44.830 --> 04:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
at the gate um I will tell you that
 
04:46:47.310 --> 04:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
during the Fourth of July weekend the
 
04:46:49.030 --> 04:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
parking lot which is a very large
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
parking lot was packed and I will say
 
04:46:54.190 --> 04:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
that about probably a half of the cars
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
that were there were out of state and I
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
will also say that because of the covid
 
04:47:03.628 --> 04:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
EP epidemic uh the state parks uh did
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
not open Forest Lake State Park and we
 
04:47:10.708 --> 04:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
we rounded up volunteers we took care of
 
04:47:13.470 --> 04:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
the park we opened it cleaned the uh
 
04:47:15.750 --> 04:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and we made sure it was open
 
04:47:17.548 --> 04:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you because of the covid
 
04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
epidemic we've seen that more and more
 
04:47:24.548 --> 04:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
people are flocking to the outdoors and
 
04:47:27.310 --> 04:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
it would just be a travesty to lose one
 
04:47:31.030 --> 04:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
of our state parks because of a
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
development project like this that could
 
04:47:35.470 --> 04:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
be a threat to any state Park so the
 
04:47:38.788 --> 04:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
value to our state economy from these
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
natural beauties needs to be
 
04:47:44.628 --> 04:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
protected thank you followup if I could
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman follow up go
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
ahead yes thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr Swan for taking the followup
 
04:47:54.670 --> 04:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
so I I agree the the bill is written
 
04:47:58.430 --> 04:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
broadly to protect all state parks but
 
04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh by virtually everybody's admission
 
04:48:06.310 --> 04:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
the the driver the intent is to um
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
derail a project that is already in the
 
04:48:13.470 --> 04:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
permitting process um and so while I
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
would be more sympathetic to a bill like
 
04:48:18.190 --> 04:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
this um if there wasn't an ongoing
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
project that that's already been begun
 
04:48:22.350 --> 04:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
but I guess my question to you is do you
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
do you believe that it's it's fair to
 
04:48:27.070 --> 04:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
the people that have invested time money
 
04:48:29.470 --> 04:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
to buy the real estate and um are
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
following the existing permitting
 
04:48:35.708 --> 04:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
project to um change the rules mid game
 
04:48:37.708 --> 04:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh on on their Investments and their
 
04:48:37.718 --> 04:48:39.750 align:start position:0%
uh on on their Investments and their
business

04:48:39.750 --> 04:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:48:42.030 --> 04:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
decisions that's that's a great question
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you brought it up because first
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
off last year we presented House Bill
 
04:48:48.750 --> 04:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
1319 and that was before any permits
 
04:48:50.948 --> 04:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
were submitted also I'd like to point
 
04:48:52.990 --> 04:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
out because I know zoning was brought up
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
the town of Dalton in July July 30th
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
2019 voted to enact emergency temporary
 
04:49:02.270 --> 04:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
zoning in an effort to stop this project
 
04:49:04.830 --> 04:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
zoning was very unpopular in Dalton
 
04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
which Embraces Live Free or Die but we
 
04:49:11.190 --> 04:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
passed it 154 to 129 in order to stop
 
04:49:12.788 --> 04:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
this landfill development that has been
 
04:49:15.310 --> 04:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
forced upon us because we had no zoning
 
04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
they admit that in the process in the in
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
the in the U meetings with New Hampshire
 
04:49:21.708 --> 04:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
Dees that Dalton had no zoning which is
 
04:49:23.948 --> 04:49:23.958 align:start position:0%
one of the criteria for citing it there
 
04:49:26.628 --> 04:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
and we voted to stop it so in essence
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
right now you by by helping us with this
 
04:49:31.390 --> 04:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
bill to protect New Hampshire state
 
04:49:33.430 --> 04:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
parks you would also be following the
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
will of the the people of the town of
 
04:49:37.708 --> 04:49:37.718 align:start position:0%
Dalton who voted in emergency temporary
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
zoning and to this date cassella Waste
 
04:49:43.150 --> 04:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
Systems the applicant has not submitted
 
04:49:46.548 --> 04:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
an application to the town to seek local
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
approval for its development project so
 
04:49:51.270 --> 04:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
if you ask me the cart is before the
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
horse relative to this project because
 
04:49:56.430 --> 04:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
local satisfaction has not been met and
 
04:49:58.830 --> 04:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
we have been harassed by this developer
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
because we're a small poor rural town
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
but we saw overall that if this could
 
04:50:03.600 --> 04:50:04.350 align:start position:0%
but we saw overall that if this could
happen

04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:50:07.548 --> 04:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
in Dalton at Forest Lake State Park it
 
04:50:09.868 --> 04:50:09.878 align:start position:0%
could happen at any of your beloved
 
04:50:11.868 --> 04:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
state parks in New Hampshire and we'
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
have also taken forth efforts to look at
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
ways to reduce waste and to as you've
 
04:50:21.390 --> 04:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
said recycle Reduce Reuse and we realize
 
04:50:24.430 --> 04:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
that mount carbury in uh Success New
 
04:50:26.830 --> 04:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire exists and has plenty of
 
04:50:29.230 --> 04:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
existing capacity for New Hampshire
 
04:50:31.670 --> 04:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
waste so thank
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%

representative Kaplan did you have a
 
04:51:00.510 --> 04:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman for
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you Mr
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
Swanson um I don't think your your your
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
questions are out of line your answers
 
04:51:08.670 --> 04:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
are out of line at all I appreciate your
 
04:51:10.990 --> 04:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
passion Mr Swanson I'm concerned about
 
04:51:12.990 --> 04:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
the rights of uh private land owners
 
04:51:14.750 --> 04:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
specifically around the area Forest Lake
 
04:51:16.350 --> 04:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they've been using
 
04:51:18.310 --> 04:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
that Lake as an amenity for Generations
 
04:51:21.430 --> 04:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
in some cases uh can you go into more
 
04:51:23.350 --> 04:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
detail about the court cases you
 
04:51:25.150 --> 04:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned in Pennsylvania and New York
 
04:51:28.110 --> 04:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
about uh odor and I'm concerned about
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
the liability that we could be uh
 
04:51:34.910 --> 04:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
looking at in terms of uh this this
 
04:51:37.470 --> 04:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
build well currently around the Forest
 
04:51:40.190 --> 04:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
Lake area there's 136 homes or
 
04:51:42.670 --> 04:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
residences all people who either live
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
here or second homes but they are
 
04:51:47.708 --> 04:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um in New York at the Ontario
 
04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
County landfill which is operated by um
 
04:51:54.030 --> 04:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
the same applicant we're talking about
 
04:51:56.350 --> 04:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh there was a class action suit filed
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
for landfill odor from up to five miles
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
away um they even created a local um uh
 
04:52:06.628 --> 04:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
iPhone app to report landfill odor it's
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
called it stinks. org you can check it
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
out um but it's a thousand a thousand
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
people class action suit filed in New
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
York state in uh 2020 uh the um um I
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
sent a link to the committee relative to
 
04:52:24.750 --> 04:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
the Pennsylvania case um that cited um
 
04:52:28.270 --> 04:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
an odor nuisance of up to 2.5 miles so
 
04:52:31.470 --> 04:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
again this landfill footprint is only
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
it's actually there's parts of it that's
 
04:52:35.910 --> 04:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
only 75 feet from the forest of the
 
04:52:38.510 --> 04:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
state park and it's by my by my
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
estimates about 3,000 feet from The
 
04:52:43.070 --> 04:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge of forest lake and in the
 
04:52:45.628 --> 04:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
direction of prevailing winds so we're
 
04:52:50.830 --> 04:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.350 --> 04:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
trash follow-up question if I may who
 
04:52:57.230 --> 04:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
who was uh who was the uh uh who was the
 
04:52:58.708 --> 04:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
defendant in those who who was the
 
04:53:00.350 --> 04:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
defendant in those
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
cases um the Pennsylvania case I can't
 
04:53:05.590 --> 04:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
remember I only read the article once uh
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
Ontario County it is um uh the owner of
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
the facility is Ontario County and the
 
04:53:13.390 --> 04:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
operator is cassella was

can you hear me uh Mr chairman can Brian
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Brian G and I am
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
a lawyer with Cleveland Waters and bass
 
04:54:03.200 --> 04:54:03.990 align:start position:0%
a lawyer with Cleveland Waters and bass
in

04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:54:06.510 --> 04:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
conquered I have had the privilege of
 
04:54:07.948 --> 04:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
04:54:10.350 --> 04:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries of cassella Waste Systems
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
for close to 30
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
years um I'd like to begin with some
 
04:54:17.390 --> 04:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
sort of sobering statistics to put this
 
04:54:20.190 --> 04:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
bill into context and these statistics
 
04:54:22.270 --> 04:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
are derived from some an analysis we
 
04:54:24.190 --> 04:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
just performed for cassella in
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
connection with the um very voluminous
 
04:54:31.190 --> 04:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh application that will be filed in the
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
next day or so to permit this facility
 
04:54:34.120 --> 04:54:35.350 align:start position:0%
next day or so to permit this facility
with

04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:54:38.590 --> 04:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
Dees de's most recent projection for the
 
04:54:41.110 --> 04:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
next 20 years beginning in
 
04:54:43.948 --> 04:54:43.958 align:start position:0%
2022 is that the average per capita
 
04:54:46.070 --> 04:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
waste generation rate in New Hampshire
 
04:54:50.270 --> 04:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
will be 1.45 tons per year that amounts
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
to over 40 million tons of trash to
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
manage over the next 20 years based on
 
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
experiential data Dees assumes a 25%
 
04:55:02.830 --> 04:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
recycling rate which means that over 30
 
04:55:06.350 --> 04:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
million tons T of waste will require
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
disposal now depending on how you
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
measure it New Hampshire has between 7
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
and a half and 21.5 million tons of
 
04:55:17.070 --> 04:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
disposal capacity over the 20 years
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
beginning in
 
04:55:21.830 --> 04:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
2022 so even if all of the state's
 
04:55:24.030 --> 04:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
disposal capacity were dedicated to
 
04:55:26.548 --> 04:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
waste generated in New Hampshire we are
 
04:55:28.590 --> 04:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
looking at a short fall of between 9
 
04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
million and 23 million tons over the
 
04:55:34.548 --> 04:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
same period and not that I what I said
 
04:55:37.110 --> 04:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
is if all of the New Hampshire capacity
 
04:55:39.708 --> 04:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
is used only to take New Hampshire
 
04:55:43.150 --> 04:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
waste prior speaker uh alluded to the
 
04:55:45.548 --> 04:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
fact though that waste from out of state
 
04:55:47.190 --> 04:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
is imported into the
 
04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
state that is to the tune of about a
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
million it's over a million tons a year
 
04:55:55.310 --> 04:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
about 80% of that goes to the turnkey
 
04:55:58.030 --> 04:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
landfill in
 
04:56:01.230 --> 04:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
Rochester taking those Imports into
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
account that would increase the the
 
04:56:07.030 --> 04:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
shortfall to over 20 million
 
04:56:10.270 --> 04:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
tons now in accordance with statute Dees
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
limits the amount of waste that
 
04:56:15.150 --> 04:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
commercial landfills and there are three
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
can accept each year every such landfill
 
04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the state is now taking its maximum
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
annual amount so if the capacity at the
 
04:56:27.310 --> 04:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
existing Bethlehem landfill is not
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
replaced the other facilities in the
 
04:56:32.670 --> 04:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
state cannot take up that slack which
 
04:56:35.230 --> 04:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
means that the businesses municipalities
 
04:56:37.350 --> 04:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
and residents who now send their ways to
 
04:56:40.390 --> 04:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem will have to find an out ofate
 
04:56:42.990 --> 04:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
facility to accept their waste even if
 
04:56:45.390 --> 04:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
they can do that they will have to pay
 
04:56:47.548 --> 04:56:47.558 align:start position:0%
substantially more for
 
04:56:50.830 --> 04:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
disposal um I just like to remind this
 
04:56:53.948 --> 04:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
committee that in RSA 149 M many years
 
04:56:56.910 --> 04:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
ago now uh the legislature said the
 
04:56:59.430 --> 04:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
following I'm quoting it is responsible
 
04:57:01.390 --> 04:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
meaning the legislature is responsible
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
to provide for the solid waste man needs
 
04:57:06.750 --> 04:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
of the state and its citizens that's in
 
04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 149
 
04:57:13.230 --> 04:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
m11a it has also found and declared in
 
04:57:16.350 --> 04:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
the same statute that quote in order to
 
04:57:18.510 --> 04:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
provide for these needs it must ensure
 
04:57:20.750 --> 04:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
that adequate capacity exists within the
 
04:57:22.990 --> 04:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
state to accommodate the solid waste
 
04:57:25.150 --> 04:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
generated within the borders of the
 
04:57:27.868 --> 04:57:27.878 align:start position:0%
state even under the most optimistic
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
projections of the depletion of
 
04:57:31.750 --> 04:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
permitted capacity New Hampshire will
 
04:57:34.350 --> 04:57:34.360 align:start position:0%
not have enough capacity to accommodate
 
04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
instate waste generation beginning in
 
04:57:38.548 --> 04:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
2030 at the
 
04:57:41.230 --> 04:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
latest if the legislature has any hope
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
of keeping its commitment to the people
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire it is going to have to
 
04:57:46.868 --> 04:57:46.878 align:start position:0%
find ways to bring more disposal
 
04:57:49.868 --> 04:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
capacity online in the immediate future
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
house bill 177 would represent a breach
 
04:57:54.868 --> 04:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
of that
 
04:57:58.510 --> 04:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
commitment there one other point
 
04:57:58.520 --> 04:58:00.070 align:start position:0%
commitment there one other point
briefly

04:58:00.070 --> 04:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 177 is also of doubtful
 
04:58:06.430 --> 04:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
constitutionality under the Bill's
 
04:58:08.708 --> 04:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
language a landfill may be placed within
 
04:58:11.150 --> 04:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
two miles of a state park if it is on
 
04:58:14.110 --> 04:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
land owned by the state or any
 
04:58:16.590 --> 04:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
municipality if the land is owned by a
 
04:58:19.670 --> 04:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
private party however the same landfill
 
04:58:23.948 --> 04:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
identical in every way is prohibited
 
04:58:25.948 --> 04:58:25.958 align:start position:0%
there is no rational basis for this
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
discrimination because there's no
 
04:58:30.430 --> 04:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
factual basis to conclude that landfills
 
04:58:32.830 --> 04:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
on state or municipally owned lands have
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
any impacts on nearby property that
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
differ from the impacts of the same
 
04:58:41.548 --> 04:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
landfill on privately owned land when a
 
04:58:43.868 --> 04:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
land use is allowed or prohibited based
 
04:58:46.628 --> 04:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
on who owns the property and not on the
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the use there's a
 
04:58:51.190 --> 04:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
presumptive equal protection
 
04:58:53.390 --> 04:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
violation that is not a surprising
 
04:58:55.430 --> 04:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
outcome when legislation targets a
 
04:58:58.708 --> 04:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
single project person or company like
 
04:59:01.230 --> 04:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 177
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
does um the committee should also be
 
04:59:08.670 --> 04:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
aware that under de's rules uh there is
 
04:59:11.070 --> 04:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
a requirement for a 100 foot setback
 
04:59:13.628 --> 04:59:13.638 align:start position:0%
between any landfill and an adjoining
 
04:59:16.590 --> 04:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
property and 500 feet between the
 
04:59:19.110 --> 04:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
landfill and any property that has a
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
residence on it or a zoned residential
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
and you can find that in the code of
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
80404 so if this bill were to come law
 
04:59:35.470 --> 04:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
it would be permissible to site a new
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
landfill 500 ft from a residential
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood but impermissible to site
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
it within two miles of a state park
 
04:59:44.750 --> 04:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
where no one lives and only visitors are
 
04:59:47.150 --> 04:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
present I can think of no valid
 
04:59:49.190 --> 04:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
scientific reason that uninhabited
 
04:59:52.110 --> 04:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
Woodland requires a greater setback than
 
04:59:53.708 --> 04:59:53.718 align:start position:0%
year round New Hampshire residents
 
04:59:56.350 --> 04:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
require for their homes unless the
 
04:59:58.310 --> 04:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee can think of such a reason I
 
04:59:59.910 --> 04:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
submit that house bill
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
177 should be found inexpedient to
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
you will you accept some questions
 
05:00:15.150 --> 05:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
yes questions Mr representative uh thank
 
05:00:16.990 --> 05:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you Mr Gold
 
05:00:19.670 --> 05:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um a large part
 
05:00:22.150 --> 05:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
of your testimony centered on capacity
 
05:00:25.110 --> 05:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
concerns in the state of New Hampshire I
 
05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
no there some opinions on on
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
the uh and what we should do about it
 
05:00:33.750 --> 05:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
but my question is have we have we run
 
05:00:36.030 --> 05:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
out of potential landfill sites in in
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are state parks really the
 
05:00:40.948 --> 05:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
only remaining land available for in and
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:52.948 --> 05:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
trash there is a very rigorous process
 
05:00:56.590 --> 05:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
that Dees requires someone to
 
05:01:01.470 --> 05:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
follow uh to determine whether a a site
 
05:01:03.628 --> 05:01:03.638 align:start position:0%
is in fact suitable
 
05:01:06.628 --> 05:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
the fact that it is near a state park or
 
05:01:09.868 --> 05:01:09.878 align:start position:0%
not near a state park isn't as important
 
05:01:10.910 --> 05:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
as the
 
05:01:10.920 --> 05:01:12.548 align:start position:0%
as the
characteristics

05:01:12.548 --> 05:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
05:01:16.110 --> 05:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
because the the characteristics of the
 
05:01:20.430 --> 05:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
land tell you how groundwater will move
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
how stable the facility will be how
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
accessible it will be and so forth under
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
Wetlands permitting it's incumbent on
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
the applicant to demonstrate that it has
 
05:01:37.390 --> 05:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
attempted to find uh facilities not or
 
05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
or locations not only in the state of
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but in surrounding
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
states that will fill the need for
 
05:01:45.840 --> 05:01:47.150 align:start position:0%
states that will fill the need for
disposal

05:01:47.150 --> 05:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
05:01:50.590 --> 05:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
capacity so that that is a very very
 
05:01:53.750 --> 05:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
broad inquiry that Dees undertakes and
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
if there's a a place in
 
05:01:59.230 --> 05:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that could be permitted
 
05:02:02.190 --> 05:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
and that the applicant uh has not
 
05:02:04.548 --> 05:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
considered the wetlands application
 
05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
could theoretically be denied so I guess
 
05:02:10.628 --> 05:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
my answer to your question
 
05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
is uh that is all taken into account in
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
the currently ongoing permitting uh for
 
05:02:18.240 --> 05:02:20.990 align:start position:0%
the currently ongoing permitting uh for
this

05:02:20.990 --> 05:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:24.868 --> 05:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
facility follow
 
05:02:28.150 --> 05:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
um um thank you for taking my followup
 
05:02:29.948 --> 05:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that there's a rigorous
 
05:02:32.230 --> 05:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
process would that rigorous process tend
 
05:02:34.350 --> 05:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
to protect residential areas that you
 
05:02:35.868 --> 05:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned you were concerned about as
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
you stated
 
05:02:40.990 --> 05:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
earlier that's an interesting question
 
05:02:44.430 --> 05:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
um you've got uh uh the Four Hills
 
05:02:47.628 --> 05:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
landfill in nashaa within two miles of
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
that our count was Residential
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
Properties you've got the Lebanon
 
05:02:54.868 --> 05:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
landfill in Lebanon and within two miles
 
05:02:57.270 --> 05:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
of that you've got a an you know the
 
05:02:59.708 --> 05:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
interstate you've got
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
um you've got the uh West Le
 
05:03:07.470 --> 05:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
commercial district there um within two
 
05:03:09.270 --> 05:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
miles of the carbury landfill is
 
05:03:11.788 --> 05:03:11.798 align:start position:0%
virtually the entire city of
 
05:03:16.830 --> 05:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
Berlin um so the way I would look at it
 
05:03:20.190 --> 05:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
is if Dees is only requiring a 100 foot
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
setback or a 500 foot setback from
 
05:03:26.190 --> 05:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
residential property that tells you how
 
05:03:28.510 --> 05:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
successful the environmental permitting
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
regime has been
 
05:03:34.270 --> 05:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
because the landfills are simply not
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
having significant on offsite impacts if
 
05:03:41.150 --> 05:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
they were the setback would be greater
 
05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
and those those setbacks
 
05:03:44.040 --> 05:03:45.628 align:start position:0%
and those those setbacks
are

05:03:45.628 --> 05:03:45.638 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:03:48.070 --> 05:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
science-based they aren't just
 
05:03:51.948 --> 05:03:51.958 align:start position:0%
arbitrary so I I it's helpful to dig
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
into the the details of the regulatory
 
05:03:58.110 --> 05:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
scheme to better
 
05:04:01.270 --> 05:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
understand uh what the what level of
 
05:04:05.910 --> 05:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.990 --> 05:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:14.548 --> 05:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
ver thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
05:04:17.390 --> 05:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
Gold um I have I have two quick
 
05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh for you the first one I
 
05:04:22.270 --> 05:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if you you can or would want
 
05:04:24.750 --> 05:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
to to answer I'm not a lawyer so I don't
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know the the legal aspects that
 
05:04:29.070 --> 05:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
revolve around it but if you can answer
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
it I'd appreciate it is it your opinion
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
that if this
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill was enacted into law that it would
 
05:04:40.110 --> 05:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
likely be challenged in court and also
 
05:04:42.548 --> 05:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
likely to be struck down based on equal
 
05:04:42.558 --> 05:04:46.190 align:start position:0%
likely to be struck down based on equal
protection

05:04:46.190 --> 05:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
issues I have not spoken
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
to uh my client about that and of course
 
05:04:55.030 --> 05:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
because of privilege even if I had I
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't disclose what we discussed but
 
05:04:59.230 --> 05:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
I can
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
say um kind of relating back to what
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
what um I think it was you said earlier
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
that is we have a regulatory process in
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
place um the the purchase of this
 
05:05:16.670 --> 05:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
property has been uh you know has took
 
05:05:18.708 --> 05:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
place a long time ago the arrangements
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
took place years ago now and so here we
 
05:05:25.708 --> 05:05:25.718 align:start position:0%
are years into the process and then this
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
bill comes along and and pulls the
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
plug would that result in litigation we
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
would have to take a very hard look at
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
that I I'm not prepared to say one way
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
or the other here today but as I said in
 
05:05:42.750 --> 05:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
my in my
 
05:05:45.470 --> 05:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
comments if the state tries to regulate
 
05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
a land use based on who is doing it as
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to what the land use is it
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
raises a very sub and you can you can
 
05:05:57.948 --> 05:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
you can imagine why it raises some very
 
05:06:01.150 --> 05:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
very substantial constitutional
 
05:06:04.030 --> 05:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
issues thank you Mr G uh quick followup
 
05:06:07.590 --> 05:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
if I could Mr chairman sure follow up
 
05:06:09.270 --> 05:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:06:11.230 --> 05:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr G for the second question so I
 
05:06:13.548 --> 05:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
live in Deerfield New Hampshire and um
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
we have a a capped a closed uh landfill
 
05:06:20.910 --> 05:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
in our in our town and that uh that
 
05:06:23.670 --> 05:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
landfill is monitored
 
05:06:26.670 --> 05:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
extensively um for uh groundwater
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
contamination off the site uh as well as
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
off gassing you know up through the up
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
through the soils that were put down to
 
05:06:38.548 --> 05:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh to cap that landfill uh is it safe to
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
assume that um this project has built
 
05:06:47.470 --> 05:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
into it um all the modern and required
 
05:06:50.190 --> 05:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the surrounding area to
 
05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that um if any leeching was to
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
occur it would be uh identified and
 
05:06:59.708 --> 05:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
corrected rapidly and before it it
 
05:07:01.470 --> 05:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
became a major problem is that a is that
 
05:07:04.590 --> 05:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
a relatively safe assessment it is and
 
05:07:07.788 --> 05:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
um Mr White the hydrogeologist referred
 
05:07:11.788 --> 05:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
to this in his comments um that is
 
05:07:14.470 --> 05:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
release detection Wells um once you
 
05:07:16.750 --> 05:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
figured out which direction groundwater
 
05:07:19.948 --> 05:07:19.958 align:start position:0%
flows they put one well what's called
 
05:07:22.110 --> 05:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
upgradient so on the high side of the
 
05:07:25.230 --> 05:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
flow flow area and then a series of
 
05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
Wells uh outside of the landfill downg
 
05:07:30.830 --> 05:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
gradient so you know what the
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater is going in to the area
 
05:07:37.150 --> 05:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
where the Line Landfill is and then you
 
05:07:38.750 --> 05:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
assess whether there are any
 
05:07:41.948 --> 05:07:41.958 align:start position:0%
contaminants in the groundwater below
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
and the assumption is that if there is
 
05:07:47.510 --> 05:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
contamination there that isn't in the
 
05:07:50.430 --> 05:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
upgradient well that you have some kind
 
05:07:52.150 --> 05:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
of a release from the
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
landfill um so yes that is required by
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
uh by Dees regulation and by
 
05:08:04.430 --> 05:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
Statute thank you Mr G thank you Mr
 
05:08:09.670 --> 05:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:12.788 --> 05:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:08:15.750 --> 05:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Gold for taking my question and I
 
05:08:19.868 --> 05:08:19.878 align:start position:0%
want to try to swing the um discussion a
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
little bit to the outof state
 
05:08:23.600 --> 05:08:25.150 align:start position:0%
little bit to the outof state
garbage

05:08:25.150 --> 05:08:25.160 align:start position:0%
garbage
 
05:08:29.230 --> 05:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm from Nashua and um we have the
 
05:08:30.910 --> 05:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
Four Hills
 
05:08:34.548 --> 05:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
landfill and um because it's a private
 
05:08:37.310 --> 05:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
landfill old by the city of Nashville we
 
05:08:41.670 --> 05:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
do not accept out of state garbage and
 
05:08:44.788 --> 05:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
we have the the last time I heard which
 
05:08:47.030 --> 05:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
was last year when our delegation
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
visited they have 40 more years of
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
capacity at the Four Hills
 
05:08:53.400 --> 05:08:54.990 align:start position:0%
capacity at the Four Hills
now

05:08:54.990 --> 05:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:08:58.990 --> 05:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
what what is the benefit to the state of
 
05:08:59.000 --> 05:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
what what is the benefit to the state of
New

05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:09:03.670 --> 05:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have out of state garbage
 
05:09:03.680 --> 05:09:06.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have out of state garbage
brought

05:09:06.310 --> 05:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
here uh I'm not sure that that I can
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
answer that uh except in a very general
 
05:09:17.708 --> 05:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
way representative and that is that um
 
05:09:21.868 --> 05:09:21.878 align:start position:0%
these facilities because they are so um
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
so carefully designed to ensure no
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
release to the environment are very very
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
expensive uh millions and millions ions
 
05:09:34.990 --> 05:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
of dollars go into construction of a
 
05:09:35.000 --> 05:09:36.190 align:start position:0%
of dollars go into construction of a
single

05:09:36.190 --> 05:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
single
 
05:09:41.788 --> 05:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
cell and um that has to be funded in
 
05:09:43.548 --> 05:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
some in some
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
fashion um all of the private
 
05:09:49.390 --> 05:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
landfills uh all of the commercial I'm
 
05:09:51.470 --> 05:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
sorry commercial landfills in the state
 
05:09:55.548 --> 05:09:55.558 align:start position:0%
so that would be carbury TurnKey and
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
ncees all of them take out of state
 
05:09:58.520 --> 05:10:00.548 align:start position:0%
ncees all of them take out of state
waste

05:10:00.548 --> 05:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
waste
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
because waste management is uh
 
05:10:04.200 --> 05:10:05.470 align:start position:0%
because waste management is uh
vertically

05:10:05.470 --> 05:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
vertically
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
integrated uh meaning that the the most
 
05:10:12.030 --> 05:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
efficient and cost effective way to
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
manage waste is to capture it at the
 
05:10:17.070 --> 05:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
curb to bring it to a transfer station
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
and then to haul it to wherever it's
 
05:10:21.110 --> 05:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
going to be disposed of after
 
05:10:24.350 --> 05:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
recyclables have been taken out so the
 
05:10:27.270 --> 05:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
the the reason that comes to mind for me
 
05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
at least I'm not going to pretend to be
 
05:10:31.470 --> 05:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
an expert but the reason it comes to
 
05:10:35.670 --> 05:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
mind is is it enables the companies
 
05:10:39.030 --> 05:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
building these very expensive facilities
 
05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
to meet their you know their Debt
 
05:10:46.110 --> 05:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
Service and their internal rates of
 
05:10:46.120 --> 05:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
Service and their internal rates of
return

05:10:47.750 --> 05:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
return
 
05:10:47.760 --> 05:10:49.270 align:start position:0%
return
followup

05:10:49.270 --> 05:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:10:53.230 --> 05:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chairman Mr Gold then
 
05:10:53.240 --> 05:10:54.430 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chairman Mr Gold then
who

05:10:54.430 --> 05:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:10:58.390 --> 05:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
benefits from the outof state garbage
 
05:11:01.270 --> 05:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
and where does it come from how far away
 
05:11:04.548 --> 05:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:07.470 --> 05:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
garbage um you're getting a little
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
Beyond uh what what I know about I know
 
05:11:13.110 --> 05:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of it comes from Massachusetts I
 
05:11:15.948 --> 05:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
think quite a bit of it comes from
 
05:11:21.788 --> 05:11:21.798 align:start position:0%
Maine um and I think those are the two U
 
05:11:23.910 --> 05:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
heaviest contributors to out ofate waste
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
but like I said about 80% of that goes
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
to the turn key facility in Rochester
 
05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
which is operated by Waste Management
 
05:11:34.350 --> 05:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
Corporation and I don't I don't
 
05:11:36.190 --> 05:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
represent waste management and I don't
 
05:11:39.430 --> 05:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
have an intimate knowledge of where
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
those things come from what I can just
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
say on the cassella side is that where
 
05:11:46.360 --> 05:11:47.708 align:start position:0%
say on the cassella side is that where
it's

05:11:47.708 --> 05:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
economically beneficial to the company
 
05:11:51.350 --> 05:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
and its
 
05:11:55.150 --> 05:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
customers to gather waste along certain
 
05:11:58.548 --> 05:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
routes get them to transfer stations and
 
05:12:01.628 --> 05:12:01.638 align:start position:0%
then efficiently get them to landfills
 
05:12:05.230 --> 05:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
or to murfs materials recovery
 
05:12:07.628 --> 05:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
facilities um they're going to they're
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
going to use those routs and if they
 
05:12:12.750 --> 05:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
cross state lines they cross state lines
 
05:12:12.760 --> 05:12:14.070 align:start position:0%
cross state lines they cross state lines
who

05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:12:16.230 --> 05:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
benefits I think everybody in New
 
05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire benefits from competition in
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
the waste disposal IND industry and from
 
05:12:27.190 --> 05:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
keeping the uh the cost as low as
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:30.840 --> 05:12:37.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:12:37.350 --> 05:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:38.990 --> 05:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative viby are you able to
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
unmute yes um thank you Mr chair uh I
 
05:12:45.670 --> 05:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
have a somewhat more General legal
 
05:12:50.470 --> 05:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
question which is uh in terms of the uh
 
05:12:53.590 --> 05:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
Le the legal recourse that a private
 
05:12:57.590 --> 05:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
land owner would have if the um if
 
05:13:01.350 --> 05:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
someone if an abutter were to uh establ
 
05:13:04.590 --> 05:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
um establish a use that was um
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the uh to his his or her
 
05:13:14.910 --> 05:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
um businesses so uh for instance if um
 
05:13:17.670 --> 05:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
if someone had a uh a business that
 
05:13:21.548 --> 05:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
depended on uh the natural beauty of
 
05:13:25.548 --> 05:13:25.558 align:start position:0%
their own land uh perhaps a
 
05:13:29.470 --> 05:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
u kayaking business or something uh and
 
05:13:31.868 --> 05:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
uh there was an abutter that uh
 
05:13:33.868 --> 05:13:33.878 align:start position:0%
diminished the ability for that person
 
05:13:36.190 --> 05:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
to get clientele by putting in something
 
05:13:40.590 --> 05:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
next door that uh diminished the value
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
is there does that person have any legal
 
05:13:42.600 --> 05:13:44.390 align:start position:0%
is there does that person have any legal
re

05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
re
 
05:13:46.868 --> 05:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
recourse yeah there's a there's a cause
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
of action uh known as nuisance I'm sure
 
05:13:53.110 --> 05:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
you're uh generally familiar with it and
 
05:13:56.510 --> 05:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
if the basic principle is that if
 
05:14:00.548 --> 05:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
someone's use of land uh or or
 
05:14:05.070 --> 05:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
operations on a piece of land are um
 
05:14:08.670 --> 05:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
sufficiently harmful to the interests of
 
05:14:14.070 --> 05:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
um nearby land owners then that that uh
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
can be enjoined an injunction can be
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
issued by a court preventing that
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
ongoing use or uh the the homeowner or
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
the business could recover damages for
 
05:14:31.990 --> 05:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
that does um follow up yeah does do the
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
harm have to have already happened
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
before that before the person can uh sue
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
for on on a nuisance
 
05:14:44.788 --> 05:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
basis yes okay so in this case if a if a
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
land owner was harmed by the landfill
 
05:14:50.230 --> 05:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
they could only Sue after the landfill
 
05:14:58.590 --> 05:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:01.350 --> 05:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
established there would have to be harm
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
from from the use of the
 
05:15:07.310 --> 05:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
property to that to that landfill I'm
 
05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
sorry to that property
 
05:15:09.600 --> 05:15:11.310 align:start position:0%
sorry to that property
owner

05:15:11.310 --> 05:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
owner
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
um I suppose I'm just trying to think
 
05:15:15.750 --> 05:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
through you know various hypotheticals
 
05:15:18.590 --> 05:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think it would necessarily
 
05:15:22.110 --> 05:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
just hypothetically be the case that the
 
05:15:25.070 --> 05:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
landfill would have to be would have to
 
05:15:28.548 --> 05:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
be there I think with any development
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
you know if you're Excavating and you
 
05:15:33.948 --> 05:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
know as a result of the excavation you
 
05:15:37.628 --> 05:15:37.638 align:start position:0%
cause some kind of off-site harm then
 
05:15:40.510 --> 05:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
there's a potential for liability for
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
the excavation so um I don't think it's
 
05:15:48.270 --> 05:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
the case that the landfill would
 
05:15:50.390 --> 05:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
actually have to be in place it would
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
depend on what the nature of the claimed
 
05:15:52.798 --> 05:15:53.948 align:start position:0%
depend on what the nature of the claimed
harm

05:15:53.948 --> 05:15:53.958 align:start position:0%
harm
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.520 --> 05:16:09.470 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:16:09.470 --> 05:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry I can't quite hear Mr chair
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's because I forgot to turn my mic
 
05:16:18.030 --> 05:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
on sorry about that so I said I'm gon
 
05:16:21.708 --> 05:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
allow one more question uh of the of the
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
witness because we have 22 more people
 
05:16:26.548 --> 05:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
that want to testify so perhaps some of
 
05:16:27.868 --> 05:16:27.878 align:start position:0%
your questions will get answered by
 
05:16:29.310 --> 05:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
Future testimony so representative
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
Murray I'll recognize you for a question
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair for taking
 
05:16:35.548 --> 05:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you Mr Gold for
 
05:16:38.830 --> 05:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um is landfilling the
 
05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
only waste disposal method available for
 
05:16:41.440 --> 05:16:43.708 align:start position:0%
only waste disposal method available for
your

05:16:43.708 --> 05:16:43.718 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
client the only waste
 
05:16:51.070 --> 05:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
disposal uh Avenue open to my client yes
 
05:16:56.708 --> 05:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
I see um once you have eliminated uh to
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
the extent it's technologically feasible
 
05:17:02.948 --> 05:17:02.958 align:start position:0%
once you've eliminated the uh reusable
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
or recyclable portions of the waist
 
05:17:11.470 --> 05:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
um really only two technologies right
 
05:17:18.548 --> 05:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
now that are available one is um
 
05:17:22.030 --> 05:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
incineration in some form and even that
 
05:17:26.430 --> 05:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
the Ash has to be landfilled um or
 
05:17:28.510 --> 05:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
landfilling very
 
05:17:31.390 --> 05:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
much thank you all right I'm going to uh
 
05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm GNA ask that we move on to the next
 
05:17:36.150 --> 05:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
I want to thank Mr goul for coming in
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
and answering all these questions
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
test thank you Mr chairman very welcome
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
so we have 22 more people to testify and
 
05:17:47.670 --> 05:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
so far we've got four through in an hour
 
05:17:50.070 --> 05:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
and a half so I'm really going to ask
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
people to please keep your your comments
 
05:17:54.670 --> 05:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
down to three minutes or less and if
 
05:17:56.868 --> 05:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
someone else is has testified and and
 
05:17:58.628 --> 05:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
given the information you want to then

hb77 I'm calling from Bethlehem New
 
05:18:33.628 --> 05:18:33.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um this bill being passed is
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
not only essential but it is necessary
 
05:18:40.030 --> 05:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
um it is home to hundreds of people but
 
05:18:42.430 --> 05:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
we are also a huge tourism
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
destination um a highly concentrated
 
05:18:48.910 --> 05:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
area full of toxins such as a landfill
 
05:18:50.948 --> 05:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
needs to be treated as a waste site as
 
05:18:53.548 --> 05:18:53.558 align:start position:0%
it is such this two mile radius would
 
05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
act as a barrier and protect the highly
 
05:18:59.310 --> 05:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
diverse and highly active ecosystems
 
05:19:01.830 --> 05:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
that exist in and around these landfill
 
05:19:04.708 --> 05:19:04.718 align:start position:0%

landfills that happen to be in my
 
05:19:30.110 --> 05:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
hometown and the neighboring Town um I
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
am relieved to hear that a company is
 
05:19:33.910 --> 05:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
doing the research on groundwater and
 
05:19:35.910 --> 05:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
surface water and although the results
 
05:19:38.110 --> 05:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
are up to standards currently I'd be
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
willing to bet I'd be willing to
 
05:19:42.070 --> 05:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
guarantee that that will change once the
 
05:19:45.628 --> 05:19:45.638 align:start position:0%
landfill begins development um in
 
05:19:47.910 --> 05:19:47.920 align:start position:0%

05:20:18.990 --> 05:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
we need to think and act in a
 
05:20:21.390 --> 05:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
humanitarian way the White Mountains
 
05:20:23.150 --> 05:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
have done their fair share of business
 
05:20:26.510 --> 05:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
with privatized landfills over 25 years
 
05:20:28.910 --> 05:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
in my hometown specifically and it is
 
05:20:31.830 --> 05:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
not near slowing down and with that I

afternoon and again thank you Mr
 
05:22:02.510 --> 05:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
for giving me the time to share my
 
05:22:06.350 --> 05:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts with you today I am Joseph
 
05:22:08.788 --> 05:22:08.798 align:start position:0%
Fusco a vice president of castella way
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
systems we are a critical part of how
 
05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
Society manages the life cycle of our
 
05:22:16.230 --> 05:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
natural and material resources from
 
05:22:19.310 --> 05:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
recycling to Renewal to disposal we
 
05:22:21.510 --> 05:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
believe we have a social responsibility
 
05:22:24.150 --> 05:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
to carefully and reasonably think about
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
invest in and develop the vital
 
05:22:28.990 --> 05:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure including landfills that
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
make Modern Life possible we believe it
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
is vital to develop this infrastructure
 
05:22:36.750 --> 05:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
under a rigorous policy and Regulatory
 
05:22:39.868 --> 05:22:39.878 align:start position:0%
framework that prioritizes science and
 
05:22:42.230 --> 05:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
fact-based examination of many critical
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
factors including technology safety
 
05:22:48.230 --> 05:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
hydrogeology and Relentless engineering
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
and operating standards we have
 
05:22:51.910 --> 05:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony to the
 
05:22:54.510 --> 05:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
committee in opposition to this bill
 
05:22:56.990 --> 05:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
first and foremost we believe this bill
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary from a regulatory
 
05:23:01.510 --> 05:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
permitting and public policy
 
05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint any technical scientific
 
05:23:06.350 --> 05:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns or standards for
 
05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
citing a landfill on any square inch of
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire land is covered and
 
05:23:14.350 --> 05:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
addressed under a very sophisticated and
 
05:23:17.070 --> 05:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Regulatory and permitting
 
05:23:19.788 --> 05:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
regimen this regimen reviews hundreds of
 
05:23:22.628 --> 05:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
criteria and requires the extensive
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
scientific review of multiple
 
05:23:27.070 --> 05:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
environmental and quality of life
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
impacts in fact the protections that
 
05:23:32.510 --> 05:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
proponents of of this bill seek are
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
covered by New Hampshire's Regulatory
 
05:23:37.310 --> 05:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
and permitting standards and processes
 
05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
the fears proponents seek to soothe with
 
05:23:42.750 --> 05:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
this bill are superseded by an existing
 
05:23:45.190 --> 05:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
public policy process containing an
 
05:23:47.628 --> 05:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
immense amount of diligence on every
 
05:23:49.788 --> 05:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
aspect of the appropriate sighting
 
05:23:53.230 --> 05:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
permitting construction operation
 
05:23:55.470 --> 05:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
closure and post-closure monitoring of
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's landfills the simplest
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
argument against the bill is that it is
 
05:24:04.230 --> 05:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it is not a scientific
 
05:24:06.590 --> 05:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
fact-based approach to policymaking
 
05:24:08.270 --> 05:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
around the management of New Hampshire's
 
05:24:10.830 --> 05:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
environmental infrastructure it is the
 
05:24:13.390 --> 05:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
inconsistent hypocritical targeting of a
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
specific industry a specific company and
 
05:24:19.350 --> 05:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
a specific project it puts New
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's waste disposal
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at risk in the face of a
 
05:24:25.310 --> 05:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
capacity shortfall in the next two
 
05:24:28.270 --> 05:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
decades and threatens over $400 million
 
05:24:31.788 --> 05:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
in direct economic impact to the state
 
05:24:34.910 --> 05:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not how you manage a
 
05:24:37.628 --> 05:24:37.638 align:start position:0%
vital public infrastructure we urge the
 
05:24:40.788 --> 05:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
committee to oppose it also in addition
 
05:24:43.510 --> 05:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
to me today you have heard or will hear
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
from other members of the cassella team
 
05:24:47.708 --> 05:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
with various expertise inciting and
 
05:24:50.070 --> 05:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
permitting I encourage you to use these
 
05:24:52.628 --> 05:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
folks as a scientific fact baked
 
05:24:54.830 --> 05:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
resource for your more technical
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
permitting and Regulatory process

05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
to each of the committee members uh I've
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
also uh provided written testimony and
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to repeat what's what's in
 
05:26:28.590 --> 05:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
those two documents uh I would ask you
 
05:26:32.070 --> 05:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
please to read them uh I understand that
 
05:26:35.310 --> 05:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh you have been
 
05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
blizzard uh by paper but we think there
 
05:26:42.350 --> 05:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
are very important arguments uh that uh
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
our organization is making uh why this
 
05:26:48.030 --> 05:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
is a good bill and why you should
 
05:26:51.590 --> 05:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
support it um apparently Mr Fusco uh
 
05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
believes that anyone who does not
 
05:26:57.750 --> 05:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
support this bill is a hypocrite um he
 
05:27:02.350 --> 05:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
has just so much as said so um is uh I
 
05:27:06.510 --> 05:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure why um uh the
 
05:27:08.310 --> 05:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
representatives from
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
Cella can't um uh provide
 
05:27:16.628 --> 05:27:16.638 align:start position:0%
unbiased um um uh
 
05:27:21.430 --> 05:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
testimony uh to this committee um is uh
 
05:27:25.030 --> 05:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to the engineering and
 
05:27:28.990 --> 05:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
other expertise that the um that Cella
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
can provide um our
 
05:27:36.430 --> 05:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
organization um has hired um a
 
05:27:39.270 --> 05:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist um a Wetlands expert a
 
05:27:42.788 --> 05:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
traffic engineer and has an attorney uh
 
05:27:47.390 --> 05:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's advising us and uh um I would uh
 
05:27:51.110 --> 05:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh um say to you that uh I believe our
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
experts are every bit as good and
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
presumably less biased uh than the
 
05:28:02.350 --> 05:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
self-interest expert advice that you'll
 
05:28:03.990 --> 05:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
get from from
 
05:28:06.830 --> 05:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
Cilla um there's only
 
05:28:11.430 --> 05:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
one um uh Point uh maybe two points uh
 
05:28:13.830 --> 05:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to emphasize one is it
 
05:28:15.788 --> 05:28:15.798 align:start position:0%
seems like there's two threshold
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
questions here one of them is is
 
05:28:22.670 --> 05:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
legislation needed and uh my answer to
 
05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
that question is yes it is um by de's
 
05:28:31.350 --> 05:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
own admission uh they are sted
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
underresourced and frequently uh
 
05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
outmanned and
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
outgunned by um um the uh applicants uh
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
who file uh for permits uh at
 
05:28:49.990 --> 05:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
Dees is um this legislation is it seems
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
to me just pure common sense um is a TW
 
05:28:53.760 --> 05:28:54.868 align:start position:0%
to me just pure common sense um is a TW
mile

05:28:54.868 --> 05:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
mile
 
05:28:59.670 --> 05:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
buffer uh so that um landfill which is a
 
05:28:59.680 --> 05:29:00.868 align:start position:0%
buffer uh so that um landfill which is a
a

05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:29:05.110 --> 05:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
very very environmentally um um
 
05:29:08.788 --> 05:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh land use uh should not be
 
05:29:13.030 --> 05:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
located uh next to a state park uh state
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%

caution to everyone that's coming
 
05:31:34.270 --> 05:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
forward you got to remember that this is
 
05:31:36.270 --> 05:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
a a forum for the committee to receive
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
critical info and let's be a little
 
05:31:41.110 --> 05:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
careful about the dispar disparaging
 
05:31:43.150 --> 05:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
comments about other testimonials I
 
05:31:44.750 --> 05:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
understand it's an emotional issue and
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly not calling out anyone but
 
05:31:48.430 --> 05:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind everyone going
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
forward excuse me to just just be a
 
05:31:51.948 --> 05:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
little cautious so that everyone here
 
05:31:54.270 --> 05:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
believes that they're uh you know doing
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing providing good
 
05:31:58.230 --> 05:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
testimony so let's uh let's keep it
 
05:32:05.788 --> 05:32:05.798 align:start position:0%

and agricultural committee at the
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
hearing today so my name is Chris Walker
 
05:33:27.628 --> 05:33:27.638 align:start position:0%
as I said I'm I'm a member of the public
 
05:33:29.670 --> 05:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
although I live in situ Mass my family
 
05:33:31.750 --> 05:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
has had a camp on Forest Lake for almost
 
05:33:34.830 --> 05:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
50 years and I strongly encourage you to
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
look at the proposed site to see just
 
05:33:39.190 --> 05:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
how close it is to the lake as well as
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
the park um you know I'm speaking as my
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
family's representative I won't go into
 
05:33:48.030 --> 05:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
the history of this but with 50 years of
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
coming back and forth and owners of this
 
05:33:53.270 --> 05:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
property uh as a second home but we also
 
05:33:54.990 --> 05:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
function as tourist bringing a lot of
 
05:33:57.830 --> 05:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
friends and families up there as well so
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
if you've been to Forest Lake you know
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
includes you know what You' hope to see
 
05:34:04.708 --> 05:34:04.718 align:start position:0%
in in many of these beautiful properties
 
05:34:06.670 --> 05:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
that you know the freshwater fish the
 
05:34:09.390 --> 05:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
flocks of loons otter beavers snapping
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
turtles crayfish and we've recently even
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
had a bald eagle that is now nesting in
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
the area and whenever we have people
 
05:34:19.390 --> 05:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
visit they're always taken back by the
 
05:34:22.750 --> 05:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
beauty and serenity of this lake so I'm
 
05:34:26.150 --> 05:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
speaking today in support of this um HB
 
05:34:29.470 --> 05:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
177 which presents which prevents the
 
05:34:31.990 --> 05:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
sighting of a Landfield near the state
 
05:34:34.788 --> 05:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
park and although Forest Lake and its
 
05:34:37.548 --> 05:34:37.558 align:start position:0%
state park is specific to our family I'm
 
05:34:39.390 --> 05:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
sure many of you here today are having
 
05:34:41.270 --> 05:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
their own concerns of New Hampshire
 
05:34:43.948 --> 05:34:43.958 align:start position:0%
parks and how they may be impacted in
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
the future by installing these landfills
 
05:34:49.948 --> 05:34:49.958 align:start position:0%
in near proximity unfortunately ours is
 
05:34:51.830 --> 05:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
is a current and real world battle that
 
05:34:54.628 --> 05:34:54.638 align:start position:0%
we're going through right now um you
 
05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire is a state that
 
05:34:57.788 --> 05:34:57.798 align:start position:0%
relies heavily on tourism as
 
05:35:00.110 --> 05:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative tuo touched on and we all
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
have seen that firsthand and should a
 
05:35:04.110 --> 05:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
landfill be permitted I am sure the
 
05:35:07.070 --> 05:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
eventual sight of the landfill the smell
 
05:35:09.270 --> 05:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
and Airborne contaminants as the state
 
05:35:11.868 --> 05:35:11.878 align:start position:0%
park would be downwind of the landfill
 
05:35:14.548 --> 05:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
based on the prevailing winds coupled
 
05:35:16.750 --> 05:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
with the thousands of garbage eating
 
05:35:18.830 --> 05:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
scavengers and animals and seagull will
 
05:35:21.470 --> 05:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
detour tourists and locals from visiting
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake State Park over the long run
 
05:35:26.590 --> 05:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
having a long-term ripple effect on the
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
sustainability of keeping it open and
 
05:35:31.868 --> 05:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
attracting people to the lake so in
 
05:35:34.990 --> 05:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
closing um I I I do know for a fact that
 
05:35:37.708 --> 05:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
I would not visit any park nor allow my
 
05:35:39.390 --> 05:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
children to swim in a lake that borders
 
05:35:41.670 --> 05:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
a landfill regardless of what these
 
05:35:44.548 --> 05:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
hydrology reports May say and I would
 
05:35:46.670 --> 05:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
suggest you pose the same questions to
 
05:35:49.270 --> 05:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
yourselves now Al those states do need
 
05:35:51.750 --> 05:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
these local landfills I don't see why
 
05:35:54.150 --> 05:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire needs to put open up its
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
borders to haul in neighboring trash
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
sites but most importantly put them near
 
05:36:01.750 --> 05:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
stream lakes and rivers which severely
 
05:36:04.070 --> 05:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
impacts the state's most valuable
 
05:36:06.350 --> 05:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
resources time and time again we hear of
 
05:36:08.510 --> 05:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
pollution impacts of landfills and often
 
05:36:11.470 --> 05:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
it comes from Impact areas in and around
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
rivers lakes which transports pollutions
 
05:36:17.150 --> 05:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
and has more directly impacted human
 
05:36:19.310 --> 05:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
populations we simply cannot let
 
05:36:21.110 --> 05:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
corporate Waste Management firms
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
permanently impact or ultimately ruin
 
05:36:25.270 --> 05:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
these natural reserves that have th
 
05:36:27.628 --> 05:36:27.638 align:start position:0%
thrived for thousands of years to be
 
05:36:29.948 --> 05:36:29.958 align:start position:0%
direct our family and many others on the
 
05:36:31.788 --> 05:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
lake we have spoken with will likely
 
05:36:34.590 --> 05:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
sell our homes of many many years should
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
this be put in putting further downward
 
05:36:38.590 --> 05:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
pressure on the economy of these small
 
05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
towns in conclusion supporting this is
 
05:36:43.628 --> 05:36:43.638 align:start position:0%
not only the right thing for all of you
 
05:36:46.150 --> 05:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
to do for the long-term sustainability
 
05:36:48.070 --> 05:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the state parks it's the only thing
 
05:36:51.708 --> 05:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
to do we must protect these Parks now
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
for the future enjoyment of generations
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
to come I thank you very much for your
 
05:36:57.590 --> 05:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
time and
 
05:37:04.150 --> 05:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:07.350 --> 05:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
yes so uh just to be clear would it be
 
05:37:10.750 --> 05:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
fair to say that um if a landfill were
 
05:37:14.030 --> 05:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
built uh next to Forest Lake uh you and
 
05:37:15.628 --> 05:37:15.638 align:start position:0%
your family and the guests you
 
05:37:18.070 --> 05:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
frequently have would probably take your
 
05:37:20.070 --> 05:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
tourist tolers
 
05:37:23.390 --> 05:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere absolutely I I I looking to
 
05:37:25.548 --> 05:37:25.558 align:start position:0%
the longterm here and what this home has
 
05:37:28.350 --> 05:37:28.360 align:start position:0%
meant to us as hard as that would be I
 
05:37:30.070 --> 05:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
would sell this piece ofct property as
 
05:37:32.030 --> 05:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
soon as we can to get out of there
 
05:37:34.708 --> 05:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
before what we feel is going to be you
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
know a lasting impact on uh the lake
 
05:37:40.430 --> 05:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
itself I I mean we're not only affecting
 
05:37:42.390 --> 05:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
the state park here but we're affecting
 
05:37:44.430 --> 05:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
the lake and as somebody touched on you
 
05:37:46.430 --> 05:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
know there is a public boat launch so
 
05:37:49.350 --> 05:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's not just the state park itself it's
 
05:37:51.350 --> 05:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
everything in and around there this is
 
05:37:53.310 --> 05:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
not a large lake it's probably a half
 
05:37:56.310 --> 05:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
mile across by two miles wide maybe a
 
05:37:58.548 --> 05:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
little bit more so we're not talking
 
05:38:01.548 --> 05:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
about a massive Lake in which um you
 
05:38:03.628 --> 05:38:03.638 align:start position:0%
know it's it's the impact of pollution
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
will be diluted over time but yes as
 
05:38:08.708 --> 05:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
hard as that would be we would leave we
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
would leave the
 
05:38:14.150 --> 05:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
area thank you any other questions for
 
05:38:14.160 --> 05:38:18.390 align:start position:0%
area thank you any other questions for
Mr

05:38:18.390 --> 05:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:18.400 --> 05:38:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
Walker

05:38:21.030 --> 05:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
Walker
 
05:38:24.270 --> 05:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
ver thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
05:38:27.190 --> 05:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
Walker I appreciate the testimony uh
 
05:38:29.070 --> 05:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
certainly you know the protection of
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
surface Waters is is critically
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
important so would you advise the
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee to amend this bill to um ban
 
05:38:43.430 --> 05:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
landfills within two miles of open
 
05:38:45.468 --> 05:38:45.478 align:start position:0%
surface water in the state of New
 
05:38:48.310 --> 05:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire absolutely you know time and
 
05:38:50.190 --> 05:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
time again you read about these cases
 
05:38:52.670 --> 05:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm no expert on this but when you
 
05:38:56.350 --> 05:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
talk about how these pollutions get into
 
05:38:58.830 --> 05:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
water systems the aquifers the streams
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
and the rivers and the impact on human
 
05:39:04.468 --> 05:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
population you know that seems where
 
05:39:06.830 --> 05:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
where a lot of this is spread and I'm
 
05:39:08.910 --> 05:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
not saying we don't need or shouldn't
 
05:39:11.390 --> 05:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
have I appreciate the statistics that
 
05:39:14.030 --> 05:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
have been put forth about needing these
 
05:39:16.628 --> 05:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
landfilled sites but why do they need to
 
05:39:19.150 --> 05:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
be near state parks why do they need to
 
05:39:20.910 --> 05:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
be near
 
05:39:24.910 --> 05:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
water uh follow up if I may Mr uh
 
05:39:24.920 --> 05:39:26.430 align:start position:0%
water uh follow up if I may Mr uh

05:39:26.430 --> 05:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:39:28.708 --> 05:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:39:31.030 --> 05:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Walker so I I certainly haven't done
 
05:39:34.830 --> 05:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
the full survey uh but I I would dare
 
05:39:37.150 --> 05:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
guess that if the state of New Hampshire
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
were to ban um locating landfills within
 
05:39:44.670 --> 05:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
two miles of open surface water that we
 
05:39:46.590 --> 05:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
would never be able to site another
 
05:39:49.230 --> 05:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
landfill in New Hampshire and so if that
 
05:39:51.310 --> 05:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
was the case what would you propose that
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do with its Solid
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
Waste well thank you for the question I
 
05:39:59.670 --> 05:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
I am not an expert I mean that's a
 
05:40:01.670 --> 05:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting statistic that
 
05:40:03.628 --> 05:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
there's no piece of property that would
 
05:40:06.788 --> 05:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
be within two miles of a stream um I
 
05:40:08.270 --> 05:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
think that there's people out there that
 
05:40:10.670 --> 05:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
are more versed in this and experts that
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer that apologies I
 
05:40:13.990 --> 05:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
I don't have
 
05:40:16.990 --> 05:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr Walker thank you Mr
 
05:40:21.948 --> 05:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:24.430 --> 05:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
Walker all right see none thank you Mr
 
05:40:26.750 --> 05:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
Walker we appreciate your testimony
 
05:40:27.708 --> 05:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
thank you as
 
05:40:31.390 --> 05:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
well next I will call up Samuel Nikolai
 
05:40:42.030 --> 05:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:44.750 --> 05:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
Systems good afternoon can you hear me
 
05:40:47.948 --> 05:40:47.958 align:start position:0%
we can thank you coming in
 
05:40:50.628 --> 05:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
sir thank you very much appreciate the
 
05:40:52.948 --> 05:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity my name is Sam Nikolai I am
 
05:40:54.750 --> 05:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
vice president of engineering for
 
05:40:57.150 --> 05:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
cassella Waste uh to the earlier
 
05:40:59.430 --> 05:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
question cassella is headquartered in
 
05:41:01.990 --> 05:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
Rutland Vermont uh which is where my
 
05:41:05.628 --> 05:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
office is we have about uh 15 different
 
05:41:08.468 --> 05:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
facilities uh in New Hampshire and work
 
05:41:10.150 --> 05:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
closely with communities in New
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire up and down the state uh I am
 
05:41:13.910 --> 05:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
particular am responsible for the
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
engineering for the company and I am a
 
05:41:17.548 --> 05:41:17.558 align:start position:0%
licensed professional engineer in New
 
05:41:19.788 --> 05:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you've already heard lots of
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
testimony and I certainly don't want to
 
05:41:23.150 --> 05:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
cover um any of the ground we already
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
have um I will point out that this bill
 
05:41:28.430 --> 05:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
is proposing what we call a sighting
 
05:41:30.868 --> 05:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
criteria is a setback requirement from
 
05:41:34.150 --> 05:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
the uh from a state park of two miles
 
05:41:36.468 --> 05:41:36.478 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire rules already contain
 
05:41:38.510 --> 05:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
citing criteria and you've heard about a
 
05:41:40.948 --> 05:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
few of them 500 feet from a residence
 
05:41:43.350 --> 05:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
200 feet from a surface water body there
 
05:41:46.390 --> 05:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
are others for airports for roads for
 
05:41:49.110 --> 05:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
Wetlands uh there's a specific one for a
 
05:41:51.468 --> 05:41:51.478 align:start position:0%
th000 feet from a drinking water intake
 
05:41:53.948 --> 05:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
two miles is
 
05:41:56.910 --> 05:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
10,560 Ft so that kind of puts into
 
05:41:59.468 --> 05:41:59.478 align:start position:0%
perspective compared to all the existing
 
05:42:01.390 --> 05:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
sighting criteria this bill would
 
05:42:04.510 --> 05:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
establish a sighting criteria massively
 
05:42:06.390 --> 05:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
larger than any of the other criteria
 
05:42:08.750 --> 05:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
that are applicable to the existing
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
surface water bodies Rivers wetlands and
 
05:42:14.990 --> 05:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
other features in New Hampshire as we
 
05:42:16.350 --> 05:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
all are aware there's really no
 
05:42:18.990 --> 05:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
technical basis for this the bill
 
05:42:21.868 --> 05:42:21.878 align:start position:0%
focuses in on state parks not federal
 
05:42:25.390 --> 05:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
ones not local parks it focuses on
 
05:42:28.628 --> 05:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
privately owned properties not publicly
 
05:42:31.310 --> 05:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
it's obvious ly only about one project
 
05:42:33.670 --> 05:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
and it ignores any technical basis and
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
just simply promes a criteria meant to
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
end that particular project we've heard
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
lots of allegations of potential impacts
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
we've heard discussion of atmospheric
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
deposition and seagull feal matter and
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
dust control and I'm not sure that any
 
05:42:52.830 --> 05:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
of those are of particular uh Focus here
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
but I would say regardless of any
 
05:42:59.590 --> 05:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
impacts it is a landfills um uh import
 
05:43:02.310 --> 05:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
obligation to be protective of all of
 
05:43:04.150 --> 05:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
the surrounding areas whether or not
 
05:43:06.070 --> 05:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's a state park we need to be
 
05:43:08.190 --> 05:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
protective of groundwater whether or not
 
05:43:09.670 --> 05:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's a state park we need to be
 
05:43:12.590 --> 05:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
protective of traffic concerns odor
 
05:43:14.708 --> 05:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
concerns whether the state park is
 
05:43:16.150 --> 05:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
located within a mile or whether it's
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
located in five miles and those
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
obligations are already spelled out in
 
05:43:22.670 --> 05:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
the rules and the regulations through
 
05:43:26.270 --> 05:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
the the dees so to take this bill to
 
05:43:29.230 --> 05:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
take a setting criteria out of uh that
 
05:43:32.830 --> 05:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
normal process makes no techical
 
05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
sense I would also say that the only
 
05:43:37.590 --> 05:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
potential area that we have looked at
 
05:43:39.548 --> 05:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
from a a state park impact that we
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
haven't already discussed is the view
 
05:43:44.468 --> 05:43:44.478 align:start position:0%
and certainly we want to be cognizant of
 
05:43:46.788 --> 05:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
the potential impacts to the view so
 
05:43:48.750 --> 05:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
when we look at what could be the view
 
05:43:51.910 --> 05:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
from forest uh Lake State Park to the
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
landfill we think that the lake is the
 
05:43:56.350 --> 05:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
most important area because if you're on
 
05:43:58.510 --> 05:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
a boat in the lake that's your best
 
05:44:00.548 --> 05:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity need to have an unu A View
 
05:44:02.788 --> 05:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
back to the landfill and when you look
 
05:44:04.708 --> 05:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
back to the landfill from that Lake what
 
05:44:07.750 --> 05:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
are you going to see for the first 24
 
05:44:09.708 --> 05:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
years of the landfill's operation you
 
05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
will see nothing the landfill is not
 
05:44:14.310 --> 05:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
visible from the lake any part of the
 
05:44:16.070 --> 05:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
lake for 24
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
years after that there will be a very
 
05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
sliver of the landfill that will just
 
05:44:25.310 --> 05:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
poke its head up above the trees and you
 
05:44:27.910 --> 05:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
will see the very edge right above the
 
05:44:30.350 --> 05:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
tree line for for about a year as we
 
05:44:32.310 --> 05:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
operate the very top of the
 
05:44:34.948 --> 05:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
landfill the waste will be covered the
 
05:44:37.230 --> 05:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
soil will be placed and the grass will
 
05:44:39.628 --> 05:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
be grow on the slopes and that Hill will
 
05:44:42.230 --> 05:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
resemble any other Hill that you see in
 
05:44:44.830 --> 05:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
the green areas of New Hampshire and
 
05:44:47.990 --> 05:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
that will be limited to that one year of
 
05:44:50.430 --> 05:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
operation so two and a half decades
 
05:44:52.548 --> 05:44:52.558 align:start position:0%
you'll never see any impacts you've
 
05:44:54.670 --> 05:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
already heard the testimony groundwater
 
05:44:57.310 --> 05:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
and surface water physically cannot go
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
to the lake they go in the other
 
05:45:02.510 --> 05:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
direction water cannot flow uphill both
 
05:45:04.430 --> 05:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
surface water and groundwater will never
 
05:45:07.070 --> 05:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
reach the lake we are very cognizant of
 
05:45:09.628 --> 05:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
the lake and of the park in proximity to
 
05:45:11.628 --> 05:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
our proposed project and they're taking
 
05:45:14.230 --> 05:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
every step to ensure that Park and that
 
05:45:16.310 --> 05:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
Lake are fully protected at every step
 
05:45:19.868 --> 05:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
of the way thank you for the opportunity
 
05:45:21.310 --> 05:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:24.190 --> 05:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
sir uh so youve sever hands raised I'll
 
05:45:26.708 --> 05:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
start with the representative
 
05:45:30.430 --> 05:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
Perez yeah Mr chair um I just um have a
 
05:45:32.270 --> 05:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
question because we I know that we
 
05:45:35.628 --> 05:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
trying to keep up everyone um in under
 
05:45:37.468 --> 05:45:37.478 align:start position:0%
three minutes and I just wonder if we
 
05:45:39.910 --> 05:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
GNA keep continue doing that with
 
05:45:42.230 --> 05:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
everyone well I've been allowing about a
 
05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
30 second uh Beyond if they're seems
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
though they're wrapping up that's why I
 
05:45:48.910 --> 05:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
try to interject about three minutes 30
 
05:45:51.390 --> 05:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
seconds if they haven't done so so I'm
 
05:45:54.830 --> 05:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
attempting to keep it Clos thank you uh
 
05:45:54.840 --> 05:45:57.788 align:start position:0%
attempting to keep it Clos thank you uh
representative

05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:57.798 --> 05:45:59.788 align:start position:0%
 
Cath

05:45:59.788 --> 05:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
Cath
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
05:46:03.670 --> 05:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr Nikolai for your
 
05:46:06.430 --> 05:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
time um I'm glad to hear Mr Nikolai that
 
05:46:09.070 --> 05:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
you uh agree that landfills need to take
 
05:46:12.510 --> 05:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
every protection uh necessary um to
 
05:46:14.030 --> 05:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
protect the immunities or the people
 
05:46:17.510 --> 05:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
that surround it um as regards this
 
05:46:20.430 --> 05:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
landfill uh or any landfill do landfill
 
05:46:24.910 --> 05:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.868 --> 05:46:27.878 align:start position:0%
experience so the landfill has a double
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
aligned system system cassella has never
 
05:46:33.150 --> 05:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
had a release from a lined landfill
 
05:46:35.310 --> 05:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
through a double line system we have
 
05:46:39.430 --> 05:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
100% success have landfills that Cella
 
05:46:41.868 --> 05:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
operates or others ever had compliance
 
05:46:44.270 --> 05:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
issues sure we have we've had periods of
 
05:46:46.468 --> 05:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
time where we've had to address odors or
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
deal with other issues but we've never
 
05:46:50.910 --> 05:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
had a release from a landfill from a
 
05:46:53.548 --> 05:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
line facility to
 
05:46:56.270 --> 05:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
groundwater followup question if I
 
05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
may um have you uh have you taken any
 
05:47:04.468 --> 05:47:04.478 align:start position:0%
measures to mitigate odor emissions and
 
05:47:06.510 --> 05:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
do you expect there to be any odor
 
05:47:09.390 --> 05:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
emissions from this projected
 
05:47:11.910 --> 05:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
landfill odor management is extremely
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
important uh it's primarily through our
 
05:47:16.990 --> 05:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
landfill gas uh management both the
 
05:47:19.150 --> 05:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
structures that we build within the
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
landfill as well as how we operate in
 
05:47:25.190 --> 05:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years landfills in general
 
05:47:27.468 --> 05:47:27.478 align:start position:0%
and Cassel in particular have been um
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
advancing in terms of our odor
 
05:47:31.750 --> 05:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
management managing wastes such that we
 
05:47:33.628 --> 05:47:33.638 align:start position:0%
can do so in a way that they do not
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
produce off-site odors we're certainly
 
05:47:39.390 --> 05:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
aware um that uh waste is potentially
 
05:47:42.150 --> 05:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
odor producing you know that if you
 
05:47:43.708 --> 05:47:43.718 align:start position:0%
leave your trash in your can for too
 
05:47:45.190 --> 05:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
long at the curb you know you have the
 
05:47:47.510 --> 05:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
potential to produce odor so we take
 
05:47:49.350 --> 05:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
steps to ensure that we bury waste as
 
05:47:51.150 --> 05:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can and we manage all the
 
05:47:53.628 --> 05:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
odors so that they are not causing
 
05:47:55.468 --> 05:47:55.478 align:start position:0%
offsite impacts it's a critical part of
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
our operation and it's a critical focus
 
05:48:01.948 --> 05:48:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:48:11.670 --> 05:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:11.680 --> 05:48:15.468 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:48:15.468 --> 05:48:15.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:18.910 --> 05:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
question mentioned that the lake in the
 
05:48:21.310 --> 05:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
park was downwind of the landfill is
 
05:48:21.320 --> 05:48:23.110 align:start position:0%
park was downwind of the landfill is
this

05:48:23.110 --> 05:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:48:26.590 --> 05:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
true so wind direction certainly changes
 
05:48:29.750 --> 05:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
over time um there there are is the
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
potential that at some seasonal times
 
05:48:34.750 --> 05:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
that the wind direction will be towards
 
05:48:36.190 --> 05:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
uh the East which would be in the
 
05:48:38.830 --> 05:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
general direction of the the lake and
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
the park um but the prevailing winds
 
05:48:45.468 --> 05:48:45.478 align:start position:0%
will certainly move um our uh policies
 
05:48:47.830 --> 05:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
and our systems are designed to ensure
 
05:48:49.830 --> 05:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
that the other management is is handled
 
05:48:51.548 --> 05:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
sort of regardless of the wind direction
 
05:48:54.310 --> 05:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
we can't rely on wind to be a success we
 
05:48:56.430 --> 05:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
need to manage the odors such that they
 
05:48:58.590 --> 05:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
never leave our property and so
 
05:49:00.430 --> 05:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
certainly you know that's part of our
 
05:49:02.350 --> 05:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
evaluation and and I'm certainly not
 
05:49:03.990 --> 05:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to say that the wind never moves
 
05:49:06.548 --> 05:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
in that direction um but um that's
 
05:49:10.070 --> 05:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
certainly is part of our Focus
 
05:49:21.708 --> 05:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:25.270 --> 05:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
H CH we're having trouble hearing again
 
05:49:25.280 --> 05:49:27.510 align:start position:0%
H CH we're having trouble hearing again
okay

05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay yes sir you decied at the 25e point
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
there'll be a bit of a sliver or few
 
05:49:46.708 --> 05:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:48.868 --> 05:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
top I'm sorry I couldn't hear the
 
05:49:51.868 --> 05:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
question I heard the about the sliver in
 
05:49:53.350 --> 05:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
regards to the view but I couldn't hear
 
05:49:55.708 --> 05:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
the question itself do you have a Max
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
elevation that the landfill will be
 
05:50:00.350 --> 05:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
05:50:04.150 --> 05:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
rise the uh there's not a maximum yet in
 
05:50:06.708 --> 05:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the process I mean certainly
 
05:50:09.510 --> 05:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
that would be as a result of the uh
 
05:50:12.628 --> 05:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
overall permitting um the top of the
 
05:50:15.030 --> 05:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
landfill we do expect to be slightly
 
05:50:17.510 --> 05:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
higher than the ridge uh that is
 
05:50:20.150 --> 05:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
adjacent to it however um from a
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint standpoint since an observer
 
05:50:24.350 --> 05:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
is going to be looking up um that Ridge
 
05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
that runs along the northeast part of
 
05:50:29.070 --> 05:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
the landfill blocks The View from the
 
05:50:31.670 --> 05:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
park and from the lake uh so we expect
 
05:50:33.468 --> 05:50:33.478 align:start position:0%
that that's why even though the landfill
 
05:50:35.628 --> 05:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
itself will be I want to say maybe in
 
05:50:38.510 --> 05:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood of 50 feet or so higher
 
05:50:41.310 --> 05:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
than the ridge that you will not have uh
 
05:50:44.190 --> 05:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
impacts to those views except as I
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
described thank
 
05:50:48.510 --> 05:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
you all right
 
05:50:50.510 --> 05:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I guess there not
 
05:50:50.520 --> 05:50:52.350 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I guess there not
a

05:50:52.350 --> 05:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:50:52.360 --> 05:50:57.350 align:start position:0%
a
question

05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.360 --> 05:50:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:50:59.430 --> 05:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:51:02.190 --> 05:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:51:05.230 --> 05:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Nikolai for taking my question um I
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
would like to just talk for a second
 
05:51:09.628 --> 05:51:09.638 align:start position:0%
about um the odor
 
05:51:12.030 --> 05:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
mitigation and um I was just wondering
 
05:51:14.510 --> 05:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
if you could explain that process in
 
05:51:14.520 --> 05:51:16.468 align:start position:0%
if you could explain that process in
more

05:51:16.468 --> 05:51:16.478 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:51:19.350 --> 05:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
detail sure so our first line of defense
 
05:51:22.230 --> 05:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
is to collect landfill gas um as
 
05:51:24.468 --> 05:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
aggressively as we can so we use a
 
05:51:26.910 --> 05:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
number of systems in order putting wells
 
05:51:29.910 --> 05:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
in um putting horizontals in and putting
 
05:51:32.990 --> 05:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
them in as early as we can landfill gas
 
05:51:35.190 --> 05:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
which is the the generated from the
 
05:51:36.830 --> 05:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
degradation of the material in the
 
05:51:39.750 --> 05:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
landfill is uh first and foremost uh
 
05:51:41.190 --> 05:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to prevent ever
 
05:51:43.510 --> 05:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
leaving the site and we have a lot of
 
05:51:46.990 --> 05:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
success in achieving um greater than 90%
 
05:51:49.510 --> 05:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
of of collection of that gas which helps
 
05:51:52.190 --> 05:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
to mitigate those odors there are other
 
05:51:54.110 --> 05:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
um areas that we need to watch we need
 
05:51:55.948 --> 05:51:55.958 align:start position:0%
to be concerned about the odor of any
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
particular vehicle as it comes into the
 
05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
landfill so we have a focused program on
 
05:52:02.708 --> 05:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
identifying any issues and working with
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
our customers and clients to make sure
 
05:52:08.230 --> 05:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
that those kinds of odors don't occur
 
05:52:10.230 --> 05:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
and then as a response we do odor
 
05:52:12.468 --> 05:52:12.478 align:start position:0%
investigations where we send someone to
 
05:52:14.830 --> 05:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
go evaluate an odor complaint if we
 
05:52:17.590 --> 05:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
receive one where did it come from how
 
05:52:19.750 --> 05:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
long did it last what kind of odor it
 
05:52:21.868 --> 05:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
was so that we can go back and correct
 
05:52:24.708 --> 05:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
any particular issues as always a
 
05:52:26.830 --> 05:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
landfill is not the only source of voors
 
05:52:29.510 --> 05:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
so we often find that we have odors from
 
05:52:31.468 --> 05:52:31.478 align:start position:0%
manure placement or Wastewater
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
facilities or others and it's tough to
 
05:52:35.310 --> 05:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
distinguish between them that's why we
 
05:52:37.750 --> 05:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
use that investigation process to
 
05:52:39.868 --> 05:52:39.878 align:start position:0%
quickly and clearly identify what that
 
05:52:41.670 --> 05:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
concern is and address
 
05:52:41.680 --> 05:52:43.190 align:start position:0%
concern is and address
it

05:52:43.190 --> 05:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:52:47.708 --> 05:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
followup yes go ahead thank you um would
 
05:52:50.230 --> 05:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
is something that you would spray
 
05:52:54.510 --> 05:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
aerosol to mask and
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
odor it is a tool that we can use we
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
don't like
 
05:53:02.510 --> 05:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
the resorting to a mask um the preferred
 
05:53:04.830 --> 05:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
method would be to um get it at its
 
05:53:07.430 --> 05:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
source and never allow a potential odor
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so we've gotten very good at that
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
certainly trying to use an aerosol
 
05:53:13.990 --> 05:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
either um we prefer a neutralizing agent
 
05:53:16.390 --> 05:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
versus a masking agent but they can be
 
05:53:18.670 --> 05:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
Tools in our toolbox especially for
 
05:53:21.628 --> 05:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas but as a general rule we
 
05:53:23.510 --> 05:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
want to prevent any odors from ever
 
05:53:25.788 --> 05:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
happening thank
 
05:53:29.750 --> 05:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh represent restive
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
vinsky yes thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:53:33.750 --> 05:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr Nikolai we talked a lot about
 
05:53:35.628 --> 05:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
different types of pollution here but we
 
05:53:36.628 --> 05:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't heard a whole lot
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
about uh noise pollution uh we've been
 
05:53:41.468 --> 05:53:41.478 align:start position:0%
looking at I'm looking at the map right
 
05:53:43.310 --> 05:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
now and there's the lake is fairly
 
05:53:45.548 --> 05:53:45.558 align:start position:0%
nearby the state park is or the the
 
05:53:49.468 --> 05:53:49.478 align:start position:0%
forest is there um I'm assuming with
 
05:53:50.750 --> 05:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
with the amount of trash that we're
 
05:53:51.750 --> 05:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
talking about there's going to be
 
05:53:53.708 --> 05:53:53.718 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of of noise
 
05:53:55.830 --> 05:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
pollution for both those spots is that
 
05:53:57.548 --> 05:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
is that correct and is there anything
 
05:54:00.110 --> 05:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
that can be done to mitigate
 
05:54:03.230 --> 05:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
that typically a landfill does not have
 
05:54:05.390 --> 05:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of noise pollution
 
05:54:06.948 --> 05:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
um the trucks themselves do not make a
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
lot of noise the one thing that we do
 
05:54:10.670 --> 05:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
have to keep close tabs on are the
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
backup alarms on equipment so you all
 
05:54:14.788 --> 05:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
are familiar if You' ever been by a
 
05:54:16.510 --> 05:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
construction site you've heard the beep
 
05:54:18.430 --> 05:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
beeping of a of a piece of equipment
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
moving backward um and so that's
 
05:54:23.150 --> 05:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
probably the loudest type and so that's
 
05:54:26.070 --> 05:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
often a focus and when we find that um
 
05:54:28.350 --> 05:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
that is a concern and and the the the
 
05:54:30.270 --> 05:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
conditions are are right for that noise
 
05:54:32.590 --> 05:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
going a long way um there are ways to
 
05:54:34.948 --> 05:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
replace those backup alarms with quieter
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
versions and we've often U been able to
 
05:54:40.030 --> 05:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
do that if we had a particular concern
 
05:54:42.628 --> 05:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
but in general because of the buffer
 
05:54:45.070 --> 05:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
zones that a landfill is obligated to
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
have uh the noise is cut down uh quite a
 
05:54:49.948 --> 05:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
good bit and we typically do not find
 
05:54:51.788 --> 05:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
that's a a huge issue but we do have
 
05:54:53.830 --> 05:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
some tools that are available to us if
 
05:54:56.270 --> 05:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
if it becomes a particular issue or if
 
05:54:58.590 --> 05:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
it's a particular of sensitive need to
 
05:55:00.948 --> 05:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
the nearby
 
05:55:04.830 --> 05:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:07.270 --> 05:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:55:10.390 --> 05:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Nikolai for taking my question um you
 
05:55:12.310 --> 05:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your testimony that catella
 
05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
has occasionally had issues with owns
 
05:55:18.190 --> 05:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
for a short period of time um I'm
 
05:55:20.468 --> 05:55:20.478 align:start position:0%
curious if Cella has ever faced any
 
05:55:22.788 --> 05:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
administrative fines for environmental
 
05:55:24.990 --> 05:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
infractions such as failing to store
 
05:55:27.430 --> 05:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
sludge properly at a facility leaking
 
05:55:29.150 --> 05:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
toxic chemical into nearby water
 
05:55:31.350 --> 05:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
features or otherwise violating Solid
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
Waste Wetlands or Air Pollution Control
 
05:55:38.070 --> 05:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
regulations so we operate in Six States
 
05:55:39.868 --> 05:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
and we have an environmental record in
 
05:55:42.390 --> 05:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
every state uh we're very proud of our
 
05:55:44.150 --> 05:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
environmental record we believe that
 
05:55:46.230 --> 05:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
we've operated a variety of facilities
 
05:55:48.590 --> 05:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
for many decades and done so in an
 
05:55:51.548 --> 05:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
exemplary manner have we had compliance
 
05:55:53.788 --> 05:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
issues at sites we certainly have there
 
05:55:56.230 --> 05:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
have been times in which we've struggled
 
05:55:57.948 --> 05:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
at a particular facility for a short
 
05:55:59.548 --> 05:55:59.558 align:start position:0%
period of time to address a particular
 
05:56:01.468 --> 05:56:01.478 align:start position:0%
issue we've had challenging waste
 
05:56:03.310 --> 05:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
materials that have taken us some time
 
05:56:06.350 --> 05:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
to address and so all of those um
 
05:56:07.948 --> 05:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
short-term issues are things that we
 
05:56:10.150 --> 05:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
take very seriously and that we address
 
05:56:11.708 --> 05:56:11.718 align:start position:0%
to answer your question have we had
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
compliance issues yes we have have we
 
05:56:16.430 --> 05:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
ever paid a fine in States yes we have
 
05:56:18.628 --> 05:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
in every case we investigate and we
 
05:56:21.270 --> 05:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
remediate and we learn from that so that
 
05:56:23.150 --> 05:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
issue doesn't happen again we're
 
05:56:25.030 --> 05:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
particularly sensitive as we should be
 
05:56:26.788 --> 05:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
to protection of surface water and
 
05:56:29.390 --> 05:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
drinking water that's our our biggest uh
 
05:56:31.150 --> 05:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
concern we want to make sure that we
 
05:56:32.868 --> 05:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
never have any kind of release to
 
05:56:34.910 --> 05:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
drinking water or surface water and so
 
05:56:36.670 --> 05:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
I'm very proud that our company has an
 
05:56:39.270 --> 05:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
excellent record especially in that
 
05:56:45.350 --> 05:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:48.990 --> 05:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
facilities thank you representative
 
05:56:51.270 --> 05:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:56:54.830 --> 05:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr Nikolai um I
 
05:56:59.070 --> 05:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
live about um five miles or so down the
 
05:57:02.788 --> 05:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
kico Valley from the turnkey landfill
 
05:57:04.830 --> 05:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
and in certain atmospheric conditions
 
05:57:06.868 --> 05:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
particularly when there's uh sort of
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
low-lying fog uh I smell the turnkey
 
05:57:12.468 --> 05:57:12.478 align:start position:0%
TurnKey landfill and I'm wondering if
 
05:57:14.708 --> 05:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
that if you have a mechanism that is
 
05:57:16.030 --> 05:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
substantially better than waste
 
05:57:19.310 --> 05:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
managements to d uh deal with
 
05:57:22.548 --> 05:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
odors we certainly use similar type
 
05:57:25.750 --> 05:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
strategies um our existing landfill in
 
05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem as well as proposed land Phil
 
05:57:32.670 --> 05:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh in Dalton are a good bit smaller than
 
05:57:35.270 --> 05:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
the turnkey facility so the turnkey is a
 
05:57:38.430 --> 05:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
very very large facility they also take
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
by far the the largest percentage of out
 
05:57:43.070 --> 05:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
ofate waste and some of the most
 
05:57:45.628 --> 05:57:45.638 align:start position:0%
challenging waste from other states and
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
so I would submit that TurnKey has its
 
05:57:49.548 --> 05:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
own particular challenges with its
 
05:57:52.468 --> 05:57:52.478 align:start position:0%
facility and its size as well as kind of
 
05:57:54.750 --> 05:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
where it's located uh we certainly use
 
05:57:56.948 --> 05:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
similar strategies but we believe that
 
05:57:58.750 --> 05:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
our strategies are very effective and we
 
05:58:00.468 --> 05:58:00.478 align:start position:0%
believe our record at Bethlehem shows
 
05:58:01.990 --> 05:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
from an odor standpoint that they are
 
05:58:04.110 --> 05:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
very effective again have we ever had
 
05:58:06.190 --> 05:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
periods of time where we've had concerns
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
yes we have but we've addressed them and
 
05:58:11.750 --> 05:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
we've moved uh ensure that that does not
 
05:58:15.468 --> 05:58:15.478 align:start position:0%
repeat uh I think we're are working on
 
05:58:17.868 --> 05:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
well over a year I don't want to say the
 
05:58:19.110 --> 05:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
wrong number here but I think it's close
 
05:58:20.590 --> 05:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
to a year since we've had a notary
 
05:58:22.670 --> 05:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
complaint at our Bethlehem landfill we
 
05:58:25.070 --> 05:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
think that's an excellent record and we
 
05:58:28.548 --> 05:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
look forward to continuing that
 
05:58:31.590 --> 05:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Murray has a
 
05:58:33.948 --> 05:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
question uh yes thank you Mr chair and
 
05:58:35.430 --> 05:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Nikolai for taking my
 
05:58:38.030 --> 05:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
question just can we Circle back for a a
 
05:58:41.708 --> 05:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
brief moment back to um gas collection
 
05:58:44.910 --> 05:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
and um what is your specific method for
 
05:58:47.030 --> 05:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
doing that once once once you have
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
obtained it where does it go after that
 
05:58:50.070 --> 05:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
is my
 
05:58:54.190 --> 05:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
question great question so uh we would
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
as much as possible we like to take that
 
05:58:59.510 --> 05:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
gas and um uh use it to produce
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
renewable energy either through uh
 
05:59:04.190 --> 05:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
combustion burning it in engines or
 
05:59:06.830 --> 05:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
turbines and um then being able to sell
 
05:59:09.110 --> 05:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
electricity to the Grid or converting
 
05:59:12.990 --> 05:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
that gas to uh RNG renewable natural gas
 
05:59:15.788 --> 05:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
um our plans for uh the granite state
 
05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
landfill do include a component for um
 
05:59:20.708 --> 05:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
this renewable energy we think it's very
 
05:59:23.548 --> 05:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
likely that it will be an RNG facility
 
05:59:25.270 --> 05:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
and so we have the opportunity once you
 
05:59:28.230 --> 05:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
take that gas to convert it to power and
 
05:59:30.708 --> 05:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
use it as a renewable source uh and that
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
as well um you know provides the the
 
05:59:35.788 --> 05:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
offsets you from an emission standpoint
 
05:59:37.868 --> 05:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
as well um so we think that'll be a very
 
05:59:40.150 --> 05:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
valuable part of the proposed project
 
05:59:42.548 --> 05:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
going forward um certainly we have
 
05:59:45.310 --> 05:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
facilities that have a variety of
 
05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
different mechanisms today um but by far
 
05:59:50.628 --> 05:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
the most is we we have on-site engines
 
05:59:52.390 --> 05:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
that uh combust the gas and sell it back
 
05:59:53.430 --> 05:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:59:55.190 --> 05:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
grid thank
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you see no more hands and
 
06:00:01.948 --> 06:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
questions in the room so Mr Nikolai
 
06:00:03.270 --> 06:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
06:00:06.270 --> 06:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very
 
06:00:09.670 --> 06:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
much next we have Sarah duet from the
 
06:00:26.510 --> 06:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:26.520 --> 06:00:40.390 align:start position:0%
 
change

06:00:40.390 --> 06:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:44.270 --> 06:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
are you able to hear me we can now yes
 
06:00:46.430 --> 06:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um greetings and thanks for a
 
06:00:48.270 --> 06:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
hearing testimony
 
06:00:50.788 --> 06:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
today um I do have some prepared notes
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
which I've edited down but I want to say
 
06:00:56.030 --> 06:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
just a couple notes um based on what
 
06:00:58.110 --> 06:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing um
 
06:01:01.548 --> 06:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
Dees certainly does have a critical
 
06:01:04.868 --> 06:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
regulating process but to dat Dees is
 
06:01:07.670 --> 06:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
not satisfied with the sighting search
 
06:01:11.548 --> 06:01:11.558 align:start position:0%
that Cella has documented and in fact
 
06:01:14.830 --> 06:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
they noted that Dees noted it in uh the
 
06:01:18.430 --> 06:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
wetlands permit uh requests for more
 
06:01:21.628 --> 06:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
information saying that they needed more
 
06:01:23.430 --> 06:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
certainty that the site search had been
 
06:01:26.708 --> 06:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
adequate in this case and also although
 
06:01:28.910 --> 06:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing for two years that
 
06:01:33.070 --> 06:01:33.080 align:start position:0%
water cannot flow uphill um again Dees
 
06:01:34.830 --> 06:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
has indicated that there have not been
 
06:01:38.430 --> 06:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
adequate groundwater studies done and
 
06:01:40.788 --> 06:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
that it's not necessarily the case that
 
06:01:43.350 --> 06:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
groundwater moves in ways that are
 
06:01:45.510 --> 06:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
entirely unpredictable unless they've
 
06:01:47.110 --> 06:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
been well studied and that has not
 
06:01:49.830 --> 06:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
happened yet in this case so although
 
06:01:52.390 --> 06:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's possible for these things to happen
 
06:01:55.430 --> 06:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I think we have to be clear that just
 
06:01:57.150 --> 06:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
saying they've happened doesn't mean
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
they happen and we all need to look at
 
06:02:01.590 --> 06:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
the fine print uh in the conversations
 
06:02:03.708 --> 06:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
that are going forward I would also say
 
06:02:06.750 --> 06:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
I've lived um and visited the east side
 
06:02:10.230 --> 06:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
of forest lake for over 50 years and the
 
06:02:11.948 --> 06:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
prevailing wind is to the east right
 
06:02:13.628 --> 06:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
over the lake from the site that's
 
06:02:15.990 --> 06:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
proposed and you can just come and visit
 
06:02:17.948 --> 06:02:17.958 align:start position:0%
and you'll know that most any
 
06:02:22.390 --> 06:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
day uh and I get reports of um noise
 
06:02:24.430 --> 06:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
complaints I got one this week from a
 
06:02:26.910 --> 06:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
woman living a half mile from the site
 
06:02:30.910 --> 06:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
in Bethlehem um truck loud truck backup
 
06:02:32.948 --> 06:02:32.958 align:start position:0%
noises that disturb her outdoor life in
 
06:02:36.070 --> 06:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
Sugar Hill so uh again just underscoring
 
06:02:37.990 --> 06:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
the point there are a lot of experiences
 
06:02:40.750 --> 06:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
to be considered here so in my own
 
06:02:43.390 --> 06:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
comments um I live in Whitefield I've
 
06:02:45.150 --> 06:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
worked for Environmental Protection as a
 
06:02:47.070 --> 06:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
private citizen and with North Country
 
06:02:49.350 --> 06:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
Alliance for balance change which
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
includes several hundred environmental
 
06:02:54.110 --> 06:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
Advocates and the group is passionately
 
06:02:56.430 --> 06:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
committed to the passage of this bill I
 
06:02:58.830 --> 06:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
want to talk to you about stewardship my
 
06:03:00.510 --> 06:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
stewardship and yours and that of
 
06:03:02.590 --> 06:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
everyone who's rallying to support this
 
06:03:05.868 --> 06:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
bill it is our responsibility to speak
 
06:03:08.190 --> 06:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
for these places that we know are
 
06:03:10.070 --> 06:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
irreplaceable people who defend the
 
06:03:11.948 --> 06:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
environment and even our parks are
 
06:03:14.270 --> 06:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes accused of nimi not in my
 
06:03:16.948 --> 06:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
backyard motivation we may be called
 
06:03:18.708 --> 06:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
activists in a dismissive way or
 
06:03:20.910 --> 06:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
Outsiders trying to influence a
 
06:03:23.670 --> 06:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
corporate development proposal in fact
 
06:03:26.510 --> 06:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
we're stewards and caretakers people who
 
06:03:29.070 --> 06:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
rise up to test to what is valuable
 
06:03:31.070 --> 06:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
people who know what is endangered
 
06:03:33.030 --> 06:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
because they live in an area use a
 
06:03:36.030 --> 06:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
service or have recognized an injustice
 
06:03:37.868 --> 06:03:37.878 align:start position:0%
it is a sacred Duty for stewards to
 
06:03:40.510 --> 06:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
speak up the parks were set aside with
 
06:03:43.230 --> 06:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
intention by stewards who came before us
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
they are preserved for their exceptional
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
value to our well-being and communities
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
for their plants and animals their clean
 
06:03:53.868 --> 06:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
water air and Landscapes landfills and
 
06:03:56.070 --> 06:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
their attendant insults to these very
 
06:03:59.110 --> 06:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
values belong nowhere near Parks during
 
06:04:01.190 --> 06:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
the pandemic numbers are staggering when
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
we look at the uptick of Youth in Parks
 
06:04:06.310 --> 06:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
trails and other outdoor sanctuaries
 
06:04:08.510 --> 06:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
that is clear testimony that we need
 
06:04:10.910 --> 06:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
this bill to avoid the abomination of a
 
06:04:13.788 --> 06:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
landfill near any number of our Parks
 
06:04:16.030 --> 06:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
pars throughout the state are subject to
 
06:04:18.830 --> 06:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
this sort of development and
 
06:04:21.990 --> 06:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
encroachment how can compare with what
 
06:04:24.708 --> 06:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
is lost yes can I interrupt please
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're well over three and a half
 
06:04:27.910 --> 06:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
minutes can you wrap up
 
06:04:30.430 --> 06:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
I will finish up yeah so we all know
 
06:04:32.590 --> 06:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
that healthy parks and a healthy
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
environment mean tourism and a healthy
 
06:04:37.310 --> 06:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
economy as commissioner Caswell said
 
06:04:39.510 --> 06:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
just yesterday so I ask you on the
 
06:04:42.110 --> 06:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
committee to step into stewardship here
 
06:04:43.990 --> 06:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
join the volunteers who scrub the pit
 
06:04:46.830 --> 06:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
toilets at my local park and the people
 
06:04:49.548 --> 06:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
who saved frankone Notch Parkway when
 
06:04:51.150 --> 06:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
people wanted to put an interstate
 
06:04:53.830 --> 06:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
through the heart of the park um we all
 
06:04:56.150 --> 06:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
have a role to play here so please take
 
06:04:57.788 --> 06:04:57.798 align:start position:0%
this opportunity
 
06:05:01.510 --> 06:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
and uh join the lineage that we have of
 
06:05:04.868 --> 06:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
proud stewards in the state thank you
 
06:05:06.948 --> 06:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Set uh will you take
 
06:05:12.230 --> 06:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:14.670 --> 06:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:05:17.868 --> 06:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
uh Miss duet for your your your valuable
 
06:05:20.150 --> 06:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
time um we've heard in previous
 
06:05:22.510 --> 06:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that the existing regulatory
 
06:05:24.430 --> 06:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
framework is perfectly capable of
 
06:05:27.390 --> 06:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with any sighting issues when it
 
06:05:29.750 --> 06:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
comes to landfills do you believe that
 
06:05:32.070 --> 06:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
the state has the right to impose new
 
06:05:34.868 --> 06:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
regulatory Frameworks based on new
 
06:05:39.750 --> 06:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:42.350 --> 06:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
opinion I do believe that I think we're
 
06:05:44.190 --> 06:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
in a situation that we haven't come to
 
06:05:46.910 --> 06:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
before I'm not satisfied that there has
 
06:05:50.510 --> 06:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
been an adequate site review um you know
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
laws change all the time because the
 
06:05:55.070 --> 06:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations in place are not
 
06:05:57.510 --> 06:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
adequate and I I would seems to me this
 
06:05:59.948 --> 06:05:59.958 align:start position:0%
is an example of that situation we're
 
06:06:01.750 --> 06:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
seeing something here that would be
 
06:06:03.708 --> 06:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
devastating and I would say not only to
 
06:06:05.468 --> 06:06:05.478 align:start position:0%
this little Park somehow the
 
06:06:07.110 --> 06:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
conversation has devolved to just
 
06:06:09.468 --> 06:06:09.478 align:start position:0%
focusing on this park but this whole
 
06:06:12.230 --> 06:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
region is going to be terribly impacted
 
06:06:14.910 --> 06:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's known as the backyard you know the
 
06:06:17.708 --> 06:06:17.718 align:start position:0%
vacation land of New Hampshire and this
 
06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
is everybody's backyard so I think this
 
06:06:22.708 --> 06:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
is a a problem we haven't seen before
 
06:06:25.430 --> 06:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
and it's perfectly justifiable and
 
06:06:27.030 --> 06:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
essential that we stand up and address
 
06:06:28.670 --> 06:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
Justice for the threat that it is to the
 
06:06:28.680 --> 06:06:31.750 align:start position:0%
Justice for the threat that it is to the
whole

06:06:31.750 --> 06:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:36.310 --> 06:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:39.110 --> 06:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
questions right seeing none uh thank you
 
06:06:40.548 --> 06:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
for your
 
06:06:42.990 --> 06:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
testimony next we will
 
06:06:46.788 --> 06:06:46.798 align:start position:0%
call Steve changaris from the
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:55.920 --> 06:06:57.868 align:start position:0%
 
office

06:06:57.868 --> 06:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
office
 
06:07:01.750 --> 06:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:01.760 --> 06:07:04.590 align:start position:0%
 
are

06:07:04.590 --> 06:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:07:08.350 --> 06:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:11.270 --> 06:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
go uh good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
06:07:12.390 --> 06:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee thanks for the
 
06:07:15.150 --> 06:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify my name is Steve
 
06:07:18.548 --> 06:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
changaris I am uh a 30-year veteran of
 
06:07:20.468 --> 06:07:20.478 align:start position:0%
the national waste and recycling
 
06:07:22.830 --> 06:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
Association I've sort of dedicated my
 
06:07:25.270 --> 06:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
life to everything about waste and
 
06:07:27.390 --> 06:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
recycling in the Northeast part of the
 
06:07:29.390 --> 06:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
country here including New Hampshire
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for having this
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
hearing it's a great discussion um we
 
06:07:36.468 --> 06:07:36.478 align:start position:0%
submitted some testimony online earlier
 
06:07:39.910 --> 06:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
so comments stand and what I'll do is
 
06:07:41.708 --> 06:07:41.718 align:start position:0%
just touch a couple of key points
 
06:07:43.390 --> 06:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
because I know you're pressed for time
 
06:07:47.510 --> 06:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know one um our industry is entirely
 
06:07:49.788 --> 06:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the hierarchy waste
 
06:07:52.670 --> 06:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
reduction recycling Organics management
 
06:07:55.468 --> 06:07:55.478 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition processing
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
and other waste diversion programs
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
and and and and that's where we're
 
06:08:01.190 --> 06:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
really putting a lot of the industry's
 
06:08:03.670 --> 06:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
best efforts forward they're essential
 
06:08:06.310 --> 06:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
to the US EPA and the de's Environmental
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
Management policies for Waste we're
 
06:08:11.310 --> 06:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
doing that but as we do that we also
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
have to have the disposal part of the
 
06:08:17.310 --> 06:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
equation accounted for so uh we often
 
06:08:19.788 --> 06:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
think that um this is a very difficult
 
06:08:22.310 --> 06:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
area site development is is incredibly
 
06:08:25.230 --> 06:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily difficult um and that's
 
06:08:27.230 --> 06:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
why we're having this hearing today but
 
06:08:28.670 --> 06:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
as much as we're doing all these other
 
06:08:29.948 --> 06:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
things like bringing recycling
 
06:08:32.788 --> 06:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
facilities online and processing CN D
 
06:08:34.350 --> 06:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
debris this is my industry as a
 
06:08:37.070 --> 06:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
collective because I represent uh all
 
06:08:38.990 --> 06:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
the wasted recycling companies the
 
06:08:41.150 --> 06:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
collectors the Facility Owners and the
 
06:08:44.430 --> 06:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
like uh we manage this material and we
 
06:08:45.910 --> 06:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
try to do it with the higher and best
 
06:08:48.190 --> 06:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
use in mind uh and we do do it with the
 
06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
higher and best use in mind so uh
 
06:08:52.628 --> 06:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
disposal is an element that often gets
 
06:08:55.030 --> 06:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
overlooked make makes very very hard
 
06:08:57.830 --> 06:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
decisions um there's an ample discussion
 
06:08:59.590 --> 06:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
today about change what I'm going to
 
06:09:01.510 --> 06:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
just it's in the testimony but it's
 
06:09:03.070 --> 06:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
about changing the rules in the middle
 
06:09:05.830 --> 06:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
of the game um I'm not a lawyer I'm a
 
06:09:07.468 --> 06:09:07.478 align:start position:0%
simple political scientist that's been
 
06:09:09.788 --> 06:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
in this field for a long time and what
 
06:09:13.030 --> 06:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen is this often happens um it's
 
06:09:16.788 --> 06:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
very hard to site and build a facility
 
06:09:18.590 --> 06:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
when you get halfway through the process
 
06:09:20.270 --> 06:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
and the goal line moves or the
 
06:09:22.910 --> 06:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
regulations change and you know we're
 
06:09:25.510 --> 06:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
always anxious to have long discussions
 
06:09:27.788 --> 06:09:27.798 align:start position:0%
about Solid Waste policy and coming up
 
06:09:30.190 --> 06:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
with the best regulatory system to to
 
06:09:33.310 --> 06:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
drive home those policies but what I'm
 
06:09:35.910 --> 06:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
here to testify to is that New Hampshire
 
06:09:38.510 --> 06:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
has an excellent Bedrock set of
 
06:09:42.390 --> 06:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
regulations to manage modern uh US EPA
 
06:09:45.948 --> 06:09:45.958 align:start position:0%
recous subtitle d uh and waste energy
 
06:09:48.310 --> 06:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
disposal infrastructure it's been tested
 
06:09:50.670 --> 06:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
it's been proven it's been tweaked it's
 
06:09:54.190 --> 06:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
been um legislated and we think it's an
 
06:09:57.030 --> 06:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
excellent system and the last point that
 
06:10:01.030 --> 06:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to to make um regarding the the
 
06:10:04.510 --> 06:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
language in the bill um the private
 
06:10:07.070 --> 06:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
sector is so involved in Solid Waste
 
06:10:09.150 --> 06:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
Management everywhere in the country we
 
06:10:11.430 --> 06:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
invest tens of millions hundreds of
 
06:10:13.708 --> 06:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in essential
 
06:10:14.990 --> 06:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
environmental infrastructure from
 
06:10:16.868 --> 06:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
recycling centers to landfills to
 
06:10:20.070 --> 06:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
Organics management the whole nine yards
 
06:10:22.830 --> 06:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
and it often is involved in a public
 
06:10:24.948 --> 06:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
private partnership and if we're reading
 
06:10:27.628 --> 06:10:27.638 align:start position:0%
this bill correctly you're essentially
 
06:10:29.628 --> 06:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
uh taking what has worked well for New
 
06:10:31.910 --> 06:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and has worked well for the
 
06:10:34.270 --> 06:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
industry and the nation in a whole as a
 
06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
whole and saying that there's going to
 
06:10:37.990 --> 06:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
be no more private involvement in this
 
06:10:40.030 --> 06:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
area that it's going to have to be done
 
06:10:43.628 --> 06:10:43.638 align:start position:0%
on estate or a public land and that's
 
06:10:46.708 --> 06:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
not typical to the way we manage Solid
 
06:10:48.830 --> 06:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
Waste and Recycling issues in in the
 
06:10:51.910 --> 06:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
nation and we're we we we want to take
 
06:10:54.030 --> 06:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
the opposite frame saying the current
 
06:10:57.910 --> 06:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
Way New Hampshire is structur it system
 
06:11:00.190 --> 06:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
is really excellent It's attracted a lot
 
06:11:02.548 --> 06:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
of private investment it's it's a
 
06:11:05.190 --> 06:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
taxpaying business we employ people and
 
06:11:06.628 --> 06:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
we're anxious to bring new
 
06:11:09.030 --> 06:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to the state and raise it
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
to the next bar but we we have to look
 
06:11:16.670 --> 06:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
at it in that full um um um rainbow of
 
06:11:18.110 --> 06:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
all the different kinds of facilities
 
06:11:20.230 --> 06:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
that we operate if you take the disposal
 
06:11:22.868 --> 06:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
piece out uh it's going to be very
 
06:11:23.990 --> 06:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to do the other things
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do thank you for your time
 
06:11:27.430 --> 06:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
today folks the testimony is right and
 
06:11:28.670 --> 06:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions I'll be glad to
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
ask any questions for Mr
 
06:11:34.830 --> 06:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
shangar representative
 
06:11:37.310 --> 06:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:11:39.390 --> 06:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:11:43.830 --> 06:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
um I I heard you state that you you
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
interpreted part of the bill as saying
 
06:11:48.510 --> 06:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
that there could be no more private
 
06:11:50.750 --> 06:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
landfills built in in New Hampshire if
 
06:11:54.708 --> 06:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
this becomes L can you kind of um expand
 
06:11:57.990 --> 06:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
on that just a little bit you person uh
 
06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
that I've heard say that and I've read
 
06:12:01.670 --> 06:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
the bill and I don't think it says that
 
06:12:04.468 --> 06:12:04.478 align:start position:0%
so um you just let us know kind of
 
06:12:06.948 --> 06:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
what I believe it's in the uh there's
 
06:12:09.948 --> 06:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
some um severe limitations if not an
 
06:12:11.510 --> 06:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
outright prohibition on the development
 
06:12:13.150 --> 06:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
of any privately develop landfill
 
06:12:15.390 --> 06:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
capacity in the state language in the in
 
06:12:17.468 --> 06:12:17.478 align:start position:0%
the me measure appears to sanction in
 
06:12:20.150 --> 06:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
favor St the state only to allow
 
06:12:22.350 --> 06:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
publicly cited and developed landfills
 
06:12:25.070 --> 06:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
in the future and that's that exclusion
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
about uh state or or Municipal lands and
 
06:12:30.430 --> 06:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
then obviously the prohibition on the
 
06:12:33.230 --> 06:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
state park the two mile radius so um
 
06:12:37.430 --> 06:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
again all those issues are currently
 
06:12:40.230 --> 06:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
controlled for very well we believe in
 
06:12:42.070 --> 06:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
the current citing assignments in the
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
state if a town or municipality or the
 
06:12:47.350 --> 06:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
state itself wants to advance a project
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
it may if a private company uh uh or a
 
06:12:52.430 --> 06:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
Consortium of companies wants to advance
 
06:12:55.990 --> 06:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
a project it may but it they both each
 
06:12:59.070 --> 06:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
have to meet very stringent criteria
 
06:13:01.070 --> 06:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's under your statutes and
 
06:13:04.110 --> 06:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
Regulatory uh enforcement system and and
 
06:13:05.868 --> 06:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
and and citing
 
06:13:08.750 --> 06:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
process thank you sir
 
06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
follow you Mr chairman and thank you so
 
06:13:13.708 --> 06:13:13.718 align:start position:0%
much for taking my followup um I
 
06:13:15.230 --> 06:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
definitely see the part in the Bill
 
06:13:17.590 --> 06:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
about the two mile uh boundary around
 
06:13:20.590 --> 06:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
any state park I don't see anything that
 
06:13:24.270 --> 06:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
says that um there would be any other
 
06:13:28.390 --> 06:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
restriction on private landf have you
 
06:13:31.270 --> 06:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
read the bill itself yes I have and the
 
06:13:34.548 --> 06:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
copy that I read had it and um I I sorry
 
06:13:36.190 --> 06:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
I can't access it right now because my
 
06:13:37.868 --> 06:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
computer screen's tied up on the zoom
 
06:13:40.230 --> 06:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
call but I'd be glad to it's the second
 
06:13:42.390 --> 06:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
section of the bill I I believe it's in
 
06:13:43.468 --> 06:13:43.478 align:start position:0%
the second
 
06:13:47.468 --> 06:13:47.478 align:start position:0%
section all right any uh any additional
 
06:13:49.350 --> 06:13:49.360 align:start position:0%

landfill site um in 2020 the team
 
06:15:39.788 --> 06:15:39.798 align:start position:0%
submitted applications to the dees
 
06:15:42.708 --> 06:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
Wetlands Bureau and to dot for a highway
 
06:15:45.548 --> 06:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
access permit um a Dees Solid Waste
 
06:15:47.830 --> 06:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
permit application will be submitted
 
06:15:51.190 --> 06:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
later this week um and applications for
 
06:15:52.910 --> 06:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
a Dees groundw a release detection
 
06:15:54.910 --> 06:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
permit and an air emissions permit are
 
06:15:57.590 --> 06:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
expected to be submitted later this year
 
06:16:00.230 --> 06:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
we've been working since 2017 to fully
 
06:16:02.270 --> 06:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
comply with all federal and state
 
06:16:02.280 --> 06:16:03.430 align:start position:0%
comply with all federal and state
landfill

06:16:03.430 --> 06:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
06:16:06.670 --> 06:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
regulations we did conduct a a Statewide
 
06:16:08.390 --> 06:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
study to locate the most favorable
 
06:16:11.868 --> 06:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
landfill site uh prospective sites were
 
06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
evaluated for compliance with all of the
 
06:16:15.310 --> 06:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
sighting rules that are intended to
 
06:16:17.830 --> 06:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
protect groundwater surface water and uh
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
public health health and safety um in
 
06:16:23.350 --> 06:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
the wetlands know Sam Nikolai went
 
06:16:25.708 --> 06:16:25.718 align:start position:0%
through a lot of the criteria used uh in
 
06:16:27.350 --> 06:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
sighting and I won't repeat that he
 
06:16:29.390 --> 06:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
covered most of them um but if you want
 
06:16:31.150 --> 06:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
more information on our our sighting
 
06:16:33.628 --> 06:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
work um the wetlands permit application
 
06:16:36.628 --> 06:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
report contains a a detailed section
 
06:16:40.430 --> 06:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
that um uh describes the process used to
 
06:16:42.468 --> 06:16:42.478 align:start position:0%
delect this to select the dton site so
 
06:16:45.150 --> 06:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
if you're interested i' I'd go to that
 
06:16:48.750 --> 06:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
resource uh so in closing um the
 
06:16:50.510 --> 06:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
cassella project team is worked over the
 
06:16:52.830 --> 06:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
past three years to comply with the
 
06:16:54.510 --> 06:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
complex and thorough permitting process
 
06:16:56.590 --> 06:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's already in place changing the
 
06:16:58.510 --> 06:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
rules at this late date will have a
 
06:17:00.628 --> 06:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
damaging effect on permitting much
 
06:17:02.510 --> 06:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
needed future disposal capacity of New
 
06:17:04.510 --> 06:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and I don't I don't think
 
06:17:06.310 --> 06:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
any public or private entity would
 
06:17:07.948 --> 06:17:07.958 align:start position:0%
embark on this timec consuming and
 
06:17:09.628 --> 06:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
expensive permitting process knowing
 
06:17:11.468 --> 06:17:11.478 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the process a law
 
06:17:13.868 --> 06:17:13.878 align:start position:0%
could be passed to deny them or permit
 
06:17:16.350 --> 06:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
um also passing the proposed law
 
06:17:18.390 --> 06:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
bypasses the established rulemaking
 
06:17:21.110 --> 06:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
process that usually considers uh input
 
06:17:23.590 --> 06:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
from all stakeholders um so that's my
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you thank you uh will
 
06:17:30.150 --> 06:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
you take some questions sure rep
 
06:17:34.510 --> 06:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
c yes thank you Mr chairman
 
06:17:37.990 --> 06:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh um as far as I know the castella
 
06:17:40.150 --> 06:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
office uh headquarters is in Vermont is
 
06:17:43.350 --> 06:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
that correct yes the corporate
 
06:17:45.190 --> 06:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
headquarters yes how many l how many
 
06:17:47.350 --> 06:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
cassella landfills are there in Vermont
 
06:17:49.990 --> 06:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
as compared to New
 
06:17:51.868 --> 06:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah I don't practice in
 
06:17:53.270 --> 06:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont but it's my understanding
 
06:17:53.280 --> 06:17:54.310 align:start position:0%
Vermont but it's my understanding
there's

06:17:54.310 --> 06:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
there's
 
06:17:57.468 --> 06:17:57.478 align:start position:0%
one there's one Vermont and how many are
 
06:18:00.548 --> 06:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
there in New Hampshire uh there's
 
06:18:03.430 --> 06:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
one there's there's one in North Country
 
06:18:04.750 --> 06:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
there's one in Bethlehem right now the
 
06:18:06.868 --> 06:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
North Country facility and the Dalton
 
06:18:08.830 --> 06:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
facility would replace that when North
 
06:18:11.548 --> 06:18:11.558 align:start position:0%
when the Bethlehem facility
 
06:18:11.558 --> 06:18:14.030 align:start position:0%
when the Bethlehem facility
closes

06:18:14.030 --> 06:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
closes
 
06:18:16.468 --> 06:18:16.478 align:start position:0%
okay uh do you know do you know if
 
06:18:18.590 --> 06:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's any difference in the speaking
 
06:18:20.030 --> 06:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
of rulemaking is there a difference
 
06:18:21.430 --> 06:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
between Vermont and New Hampshire when
 
06:18:23.590 --> 06:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
it comes to Ru
 
06:18:25.708 --> 06:18:25.718 align:start position:0%
making I'm not familiar with the Vermont
 
06:18:28.430 --> 06:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:32.750 --> 06:18:32.760 align:start position:0%

question um Mr gillo I think um Mr
 
06:18:44.468 --> 06:18:44.478 align:start position:0%
Nikolai had talked about a process where
 
06:18:47.190 --> 06:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
if uncontaminated water is comes into
 
06:18:50.350 --> 06:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
the landfill and then it's uh monitored
 
06:18:53.510 --> 06:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it's contaminated when it goes out
 
06:18:56.910 --> 06:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
um if that's the case then then uh how
 
06:18:59.788 --> 06:18:59.798 align:start position:0%
is that aerated what what do you do with
 
06:19:02.590 --> 06:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
that contaminated water if that tends to
 
06:19:04.830 --> 06:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
be the
 
06:19:08.590 --> 06:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
case um well if you're speaking to
 
06:19:10.590 --> 06:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
contaminated groundwater I would defer
 
06:19:13.190 --> 06:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
to um Tim White who testified earlier
 
06:19:15.510 --> 06:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
he's a hydrogeologist who will be in
 
06:19:17.350 --> 06:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
charge of monitoring this facility and
 
06:19:19.628 --> 06:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
and would be in charge of remediating
 
06:19:22.230 --> 06:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
any any kind of release but I I would
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
like to emphasize the point that this
 
06:19:26.270 --> 06:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
facility is going to have have a double
 
06:19:29.628 --> 06:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
line system and that that system and the
 
06:19:31.150 --> 06:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
materials used in the system and the
 
06:19:33.310 --> 06:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
procedures used to build it have have
 
06:19:35.468 --> 06:19:35.478 align:start position:0%
been in place for 35 years in in New
 
06:19:37.708 --> 06:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and it's been proven to
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
work I I I would reinforce what Sam said
 
06:19:42.590 --> 06:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any landfill in New
 
06:19:45.430 --> 06:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or in Northern New England um
 
06:19:47.350 --> 06:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
that has leaked through its liner and
 
06:19:49.788 --> 06:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
created an issue that was measurable um
 
06:19:51.350 --> 06:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
much less created a problem so I think
 
06:19:53.110 --> 06:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
there's a high confidence level in these
 
06:19:55.350 --> 06:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
facilities that they they do not leak
 
06:20:00.510 --> 06:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
and this one won't leave thank you thank
 
06:20:05.708 --> 06:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you for coming in today T

hello hello hi this is Pam Kath um thank
 
06:21:19.230 --> 06:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and committee members
 
06:21:23.628 --> 06:21:23.638 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak against HB
 
06:21:26.910 --> 06:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
177 um I'm probably one of of the
 
06:21:30.750 --> 06:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
few lifelong family members in the town
 
06:21:32.910 --> 06:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
of Dalton my family has lived here for
 
06:21:35.990 --> 06:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
decades it used to be uh a quiet and
 
06:21:36.000 --> 06:21:36.948 align:start position:0%
decades it used to be uh a quiet and
pleasant

06:21:36.948 --> 06:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
pleasant
 
06:21:39.830 --> 06:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
town and it is a small town it's poor
 
06:21:42.070 --> 06:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
made up mostly of elderly and low income
 
06:21:44.868 --> 06:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
but Dalton has been targeted citizens
 
06:21:47.750 --> 06:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
are being harassed sazed and intimidated
 
06:21:49.430 --> 06:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
over the possibility of a landfill
 
06:21:51.948 --> 06:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
coming to town some don't dare to speak
 
06:21:54.030 --> 06:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
their minds for fear of consequences
 
06:21:56.590 --> 06:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
suffered by the anti-land landfill
 
06:21:58.430 --> 06:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
faction we've seen their violence and
 
06:22:01.310 --> 06:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
intimidation firsthand the number of
 
06:22:03.270 --> 06:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
Dalton residents who could benefit from
 
06:22:06.150 --> 06:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
hosting a landfill are small compared to
 
06:22:08.430 --> 06:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
the large number of non-residents who
 
06:22:10.628 --> 06:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
are only too glad to declare they are
 
06:22:13.390 --> 06:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
the majority and they know what is best
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
best for who not for Dalton this town
 
06:22:18.670 --> 06:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
has become so divided since the Takeover
 
06:22:21.390 --> 06:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
of the anti- landfill factions neighbors
 
06:22:23.670 --> 06:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
you've known forever are not speaking to
 
06:22:26.230 --> 06:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
each other why even our board has
 
06:22:28.430 --> 06:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
members of the anti- landfill faction on
 
06:22:30.750 --> 06:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
it how fair is that to the residents of
 
06:22:34.390 --> 06:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
dalon defeated before we even start the
 
06:22:36.310 --> 06:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
landfill would give Dalton a wonderful
 
06:22:38.910 --> 06:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
tax base an opportunity to provide
 
06:22:41.510 --> 06:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
services to our elderly an opportunity
 
06:22:43.110 --> 06:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
to get our Police Department back
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of drug activity
 
06:22:48.708 --> 06:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
here grows and thrives here why because
 
06:22:51.590 --> 06:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
Dalton is poor it attracts gets
 
06:22:54.310 --> 06:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
attracted by poor towns having local law
 
06:22:56.070 --> 06:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement in this town
 
06:22:57.868 --> 06:22:57.878 align:start position:0%
again would Aid the already stretched
 
06:23:00.750 --> 06:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
State Police but how do we do that by
 
06:23:03.750 --> 06:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
hosting a landfill our EMS fire and
 
06:23:05.830 --> 06:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
Highway departments could also benefit
 
06:23:08.150 --> 06:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
by hosting a landfill while I have no
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
complaints on their services now they do
 
06:23:12.310 --> 06:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
the best they can with what they have
 
06:23:14.310 --> 06:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
but if funded by hosting a landfill they
 
06:23:17.670 --> 06:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
could do so much more another benefit of
 
06:23:19.830 --> 06:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
landfill hosting would be the
 
06:23:22.070 --> 06:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create high quality
 
06:23:24.670 --> 06:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
internet service this would provide all
 
06:23:27.350 --> 06:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
of the rural spots in our towns internet
 
06:23:29.948 --> 06:23:29.958 align:start position:0%
service for those who work online school
 
06:23:32.830 --> 06:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
online attend public meetings online or
 
06:23:34.750 --> 06:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
those that just enjoy being
 
06:23:37.350 --> 06:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
online we could also become educated
 
06:23:40.270 --> 06:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
firsthand on Recycling and repurposing
 
06:23:43.390 --> 06:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
that is what we want right I've been to
 
06:23:47.750 --> 06:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
the cassella proposed site and I think
 
06:23:49.750 --> 06:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be great and I've also
 
06:23:51.350 --> 06:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
been to the Bethlehem site and it
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't smell it's not dirty a lot of
 
06:23:56.708 --> 06:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
those people that are opposing the
 
06:23:58.948 --> 06:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
landfill have not even been there to
 
06:24:00.350 --> 06:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
find out for
 
06:24:03.390 --> 06:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
themselves so for the good of the future
 
06:24:06.230 --> 06:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
we should defeat HB
 
06:24:09.110 --> 06:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
177 I'm angered at the elite few in
 
06:24:11.230 --> 06:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
Dalton that accuse us of not wanting to
 
06:24:13.150 --> 06:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
pay our taxes and that is the reason we
 
06:24:15.628 --> 06:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
want a landfill we want to pay our taxes
 
06:24:18.110 --> 06:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
but we have a hard time paying them they
 
06:24:19.990 --> 06:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't have that problem they are out of
 
06:24:22.670 --> 06:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
touch with the real Dalton Lifestyle the
 
06:24:24.548 --> 06:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
school and County taxes are going up I
 
06:24:26.350 --> 06:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
wonder how the luck board will handle
 
06:24:28.628 --> 06:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
that in a poor town with no money raise
 
06:24:31.390 --> 06:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
our taxes so in closing I say don't
 
06:24:33.110 --> 06:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
banish the landfills they're the ones
 
06:24:35.830 --> 06:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
trying to take care of the trash that
 
06:24:38.868 --> 06:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
everyone generates they are the ones
 
06:24:40.948 --> 06:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
developing new ways to recycle and
 
06:24:43.590 --> 06:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
repurpose the trash it's their job
 
06:24:45.990 --> 06:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
turning trash into treasure as one might
 
06:24:48.390 --> 06:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
say the anti- landfill group should be
 
06:24:50.548 --> 06:24:50.558 align:start position:0%
going after the packaging developers and
 
06:24:52.750 --> 06:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
product manufacturers then there would
 
06:24:55.350 --> 06:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
be less of a need for landfills
 
06:24:57.708 --> 06:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
landfills provide a solution to today's
 
06:25:00.670 --> 06:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
throwaway society and that Society will
 
06:25:03.990 --> 06:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
not be changing anytime soon and as far
 
06:25:06.948 --> 06:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
as Forest Lake being pristine the Forest
 
06:25:09.430 --> 06:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
Lake members know it is not what about
 
06:25:12.350 --> 06:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
the boat gasoline and oil issues and
 
06:25:15.190 --> 06:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
other issues that plague that WRA up

06:26:43.468 --> 06:26:43.478 align:start position:0%
town would it be in terms of increased
 
06:26:46.910 --> 06:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
tax money uh to the facility
 
06:26:50.788 --> 06:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
or you know other other means of can you
 
06:26:53.510 --> 06:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that sure Canen thank you
 
06:26:55.670 --> 06:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
um yes it would be inre
 
06:26:58.670 --> 06:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
tax money make us a nice tax space we
 
06:27:02.070 --> 06:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
could get services in the town that are
 
06:27:04.468 --> 06:27:04.478 align:start position:0%
may never have been there um we have a
 
06:27:06.190 --> 06:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
lot of seniors living there I'm not so
 
06:27:09.150 --> 06:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
sure we have any services for them our
 
06:27:12.670 --> 06:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
EMS and Highway Department and fire
 
06:27:15.110 --> 06:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
department like I said they do great
 
06:27:17.230 --> 06:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
with what they have but they could do a
 
06:27:20.830 --> 06:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
whole lot more with extra funding um I
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't see this as a loss if anything I
 
06:27:27.510 --> 06:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
think that for Lake would be uh much
 
06:27:30.868 --> 06:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
better handled with extra financing um
 
06:27:34.628 --> 06:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
sorry extra funding um to create a
 
06:27:36.990 --> 06:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee to take care of that Lake and
 
06:27:40.708 --> 06:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
make sure it does not get Pro
 
06:27:42.948 --> 06:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
polluted thank you any additional
 
06:27:45.150 --> 06:27:45.160 align:start position:0%

I'd like to momentarily digress from my
 
06:28:29.680 --> 06:28:31.070 align:start position:0%
I'd like to momentarily digress from my
prepared

06:28:31.070 --> 06:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
06:28:33.830 --> 06:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
notes to address the gentleman who
 
06:28:36.110 --> 06:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
earlier said that incineration and
 
06:28:38.230 --> 06:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
landfills are the only major way to deal
 
06:28:41.190 --> 06:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
with waste he failed to mention specific
 
06:28:43.230 --> 06:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
reuse methods and if New Hampshire
 
06:28:45.390 --> 06:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
chooses to take care of its own Solid
 
06:28:45.400 --> 06:28:47.468 align:start position:0%
chooses to take care of its own Solid
Waste

06:28:47.468 --> 06:28:47.478 align:start position:0%
Waste
 
06:28:49.628 --> 06:28:49.638 align:start position:0%
responsibilities composting organic
 
06:28:51.548 --> 06:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
waste or kitchen waste would remove a
 
06:28:54.548 --> 06:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
quarter to a third of what now goes into
 
06:28:56.708 --> 06:28:56.718 align:start position:0%
land fills and could be done at
 
06:28:58.990 --> 06:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
municipal waste sites and sold back or
 
06:29:01.868 --> 06:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
donated to the public where there is a
 
06:29:04.468 --> 06:29:04.478 align:start position:0%
will there is a way but now back to
 
06:29:07.150 --> 06:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
state parks which is what we really are
 
06:29:10.150 --> 06:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
talking about here today permit me to
 
06:29:12.910 --> 06:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
ask you if you live any of you near one
 
06:29:15.468 --> 06:29:15.478 align:start position:0%
of the 68 affordable and beautiful state
 
06:29:17.708 --> 06:29:17.718 align:start position:0%
parks in New Hampshire do you recreate
 
06:29:20.030 --> 06:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
in these spaces have you worked or
 
06:29:21.990 --> 06:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
volunteered in any of these New
 
06:29:24.070 --> 06:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state parks have your friends
 
06:29:27.190 --> 06:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
and relatives enjoyed their time there
 
06:29:29.030 --> 06:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
and have you noticed visitors from other
 
06:29:30.708 --> 06:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
parts of the world who are delighted to
 
06:29:33.670 --> 06:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
vacation in and at our Lakes waterways
 
06:29:36.590 --> 06:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
campgrounds and trails I have the
 
06:29:39.190 --> 06:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
benefit due to the foresight of those
 
06:29:40.868 --> 06:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
before us to say yes to all these
 
06:29:43.270 --> 06:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions and I imagine you are nodding
 
06:29:46.230 --> 06:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
your heads too upon my
 
06:29:48.990 --> 06:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
asking I also drive by a corporate
 
06:29:52.510 --> 06:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
landfill weekly my windows are rolled up
 
06:29:55.110 --> 06:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
L I become literally sickened by the
 
06:29:58.788 --> 06:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
buffed noxious rotten egg like odor that
 
06:30:00.670 --> 06:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
routinely emanates from the mountain of
 
06:30:03.390 --> 06:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
partially outof State trash is
 
06:30:05.868 --> 06:30:05.878 align:start position:0%
paradoxically called a
 
06:30:08.430 --> 06:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
landfill if seagulls are not circling it
 
06:30:10.548 --> 06:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
is apt to be because disruptive noise
 
06:30:12.948 --> 06:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
cannons have been fired to Ward them off
 
06:30:15.868 --> 06:30:15.878 align:start position:0%
their return is predictable and certain
 
06:30:17.468 --> 06:30:17.478 align:start position:0%
we know that land dwelling seagulls
 
06:30:19.390 --> 06:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
pollute our lakes ponds and waterways
 
06:30:22.270 --> 06:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
with a constant deposit of high nitrogen
 
06:30:24.830 --> 06:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
feces that also carry fungal and back
 
06:30:27.670 --> 06:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
bacterial diseases I'm reminded also
 
06:30:30.548 --> 06:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
that the EPA says that all landfills
 
06:30:33.430 --> 06:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
leak eventually
 
06:30:36.070 --> 06:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
period And by the way that landfill I
 
06:30:39.310 --> 06:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
drive by is considered air quotes
 
06:30:41.708 --> 06:30:41.718 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art So I ask you one more
 
06:30:44.350 --> 06:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
question before I leave you today do we
 
06:30:46.430 --> 06:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
proactively commit to stopping the
 
06:30:48.350 --> 06:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
threat of a new landfill being located
 
06:30:51.070 --> 06:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
closer than two miles from one of our
 
06:30:53.670 --> 06:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state parks or do we leave
 
06:30:56.310 --> 06:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
this in congruity to our descendants
 
06:30:58.628 --> 06:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
left with a preventable mess never again
 
06:31:00.190 --> 06:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
to regain what is
 
06:31:02.788 --> 06:31:02.798 align:start position:0%
lost I hope you will decide that a two
 
06:31:05.548 --> 06:31:05.558 align:start position:0%
mile buffer zone between a new landfill
 
06:31:07.388 --> 06:31:07.398 align:start position:0%
and a New Hampshire State Park makes
 
06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
sense in relation to science economics
 
06:31:12.548 --> 06:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
quality of life and protection of our
 
06:31:15.030 --> 06:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
unique and precious natural
 
06:31:18.910 --> 06:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
resources I urge you to pass HB
 
06:31:21.350 --> 06:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
177 and I thank you for your time and
 
06:31:21.360 --> 06:31:23.548 align:start position:0%

06:31:23.548 --> 06:31:23.558 align:start position:0%
thoughtful
 
06:31:25.948 --> 06:31:25.958 align:start position:0%
consideration thank thank you any
 
06:31:30.548 --> 06:31:30.558 align:start position:0%

[Music]

06:31:43.708 --> 06:31:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:46.948 --> 06:31:46.958 align:start position:0%
Wham there's more sense in that than
 
06:31:53.670 --> 06:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:53.680 --> 06:32:02.468 align:start position:0%
 
said

06:32:02.468 --> 06:32:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:05.948 --> 06:32:05.958 align:start position:0%
unmuted now how do I get on you're on we
 
06:32:08.510 --> 06:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
can hear you okay all right I'll try to
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
be brief I know there's a whole lot
 
06:32:14.948 --> 06:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
going on today uh but first and most of
 
06:32:18.708 --> 06:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
anything I I'm opposed to Bill
 
06:32:21.628 --> 06:32:21.638 align:start position:0%
177 because again you're changing the
 
06:32:24.310 --> 06:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
rules at the end of the game I think it
 
06:32:27.388 --> 06:32:27.398 align:start position:0%
should be up to the Dalton to reserve
 
06:32:29.270 --> 06:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
the rights to weigh the pros and cons of
 
06:32:31.788 --> 06:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
the educated themselves on a large
 
06:32:33.948 --> 06:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
industrial project in their town that
 
06:32:35.788 --> 06:32:35.798 align:start position:0%
could be a huge benefit to
 
06:32:39.788 --> 06:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
them there's many Dal folk in business
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
who will not speak out on this bill
 
06:32:46.190 --> 06:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
because of uh some attacks
 
06:32:48.830 --> 06:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
verbally uh
 
06:32:51.430 --> 06:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
from uh the Forest Lake
 
06:32:54.670 --> 06:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
group uh cuz we we're we're sinister
 
06:32:56.230 --> 06:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
people because we'd like to make the
 
06:32:59.190 --> 06:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
choice ourselves anyways uh I'm not
 
06:33:01.070 --> 06:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
afraid to speak out for these people you
 
06:33:03.750 --> 06:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
know there is a lot of taxpayers in the
 
06:33:06.270 --> 06:33:06.280 align:start position:0%
town of Dalton that are retired and
 
06:33:09.230 --> 06:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
don't have a big retirement fund and
 
06:33:10.868 --> 06:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
have to go without things and change
 
06:33:13.548 --> 06:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
their lifestyle so they can pay their
 
06:33:16.270 --> 06:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
taxes that's why I feel this is a good
 
06:33:18.830 --> 06:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the taxpayers to make a
 
06:33:20.910 --> 06:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
decision and not the state halfway
 
06:33:21.948 --> 06:33:21.958 align:start position:0%
through the
 
06:33:25.270 --> 06:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
game so uh there's many many other
 
06:33:26.708 --> 06:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
things I'd like to say but I know you're
 
06:33:28.270 --> 06:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
trying to keep this brief and I would
 
06:33:30.948 --> 06:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
like to let some of the other taxpayers
 
06:33:35.230 --> 06:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
weigh in on this so uh again Kevin

06:34:33.628 --> 06:34:33.638 align:start position:0%
world but more importantly I have also
 
06:34:36.548 --> 06:34:36.558 align:start position:0%
visited each of the 234 towns in New
 
06:34:38.388 --> 06:34:38.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the two dozen
 
06:34:41.548 --> 06:34:41.558 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places I can say from
 
06:34:43.230 --> 06:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
this firsthand experience that we have
 
06:34:46.030 --> 06:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
an incredibly beautiful state rich in
 
06:34:48.030 --> 06:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
natural resources from the great North
 
06:34:50.910 --> 06:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
Woods down to the madok region and over
 
06:34:53.548 --> 06:34:53.558 align:start position:0%
to the Sea Coast I'm the youngest of
 
06:34:55.350 --> 06:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
four children some of my Fondest
 
06:34:57.868 --> 06:34:57.878 align:start position:0%
Memories as a child include going for a
 
06:34:59.670 --> 06:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
weekend drive through Franconia or
 
06:35:02.350 --> 06:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
Crawford Notch state parks climbing the
 
06:35:04.750 --> 06:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
lookout tower at week State Park
 
06:35:07.230 --> 06:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
exploring Odon State Park and taking
 
06:35:10.590 --> 06:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
swim lessons at Forest Lake State Park
 
06:35:12.270 --> 06:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is blessed with an
 
06:35:14.230 --> 06:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
abundance of state parks forests
 
06:35:16.230 --> 06:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
mountains and historic sites that
 
06:35:18.910 --> 06:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
attract local families and tourists
 
06:35:21.468 --> 06:35:21.478 align:start position:0%
alike the impact of our natural
 
06:35:24.510 --> 06:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
resources on the local and state economy
 
06:35:26.948 --> 06:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
and on the quality of life are
 
06:35:29.830 --> 06:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
substantial I have to ask then why would
 
06:35:31.868 --> 06:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
anyone think it would be a good idea to
 
06:35:33.948 --> 06:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
allow a landfill to be established
 
06:35:37.628 --> 06:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
within close proximity of a state park
 
06:35:40.030 --> 06:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
the potential adverse impact on present
 
06:35:41.990 --> 06:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
and future use of the park and the
 
06:35:44.868 --> 06:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
surrounding area is clear I would name
 
06:35:47.830 --> 06:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
the following concerns as only my start
 
06:35:50.628 --> 06:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
surfacing groundwater contamination
 
06:35:53.150 --> 06:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
noise pollution from landfill operation
 
06:35:55.468 --> 06:35:55.478 align:start position:0%
and from Trucking air pollution
 
06:35:58.150 --> 06:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
including the unpleasant odors and pest
 
06:36:00.708 --> 06:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
animals I do recognize the need to
 
06:36:02.750 --> 06:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
address Solid Waste Management and
 
06:36:06.388 --> 06:36:06.398 align:start position:0%
recycling as consumers as municipalities
 
06:36:09.468 --> 06:36:09.478 align:start position:0%
and as a state the solution however must
 
06:36:10.788 --> 06:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire's natural
 
06:36:13.548 --> 06:36:13.558 align:start position:0%
resources and our quality of life I urge
 
06:36:15.948 --> 06:36:15.958 align:start position:0%
the committee to pass this legislation
 
06:36:18.948 --> 06:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
to protect all New Hampshire state parks
 
06:36:20.830 --> 06:36:20.840 align:start position:0%

06:36:27.948 --> 06:36:27.958 align:start position:0%

you very much members of the Comm

uh my name is Sebastian Fuentes uh I'm
 
06:37:58.430 --> 06:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
an active member of the North Country
 
06:38:00.708 --> 06:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
Community uh I'm just here to ask you
 
06:38:03.788 --> 06:38:03.798 align:start position:0%
for um to your support for this bill 177
 
06:38:06.350 --> 06:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
for a few reasons one of them because
 
06:38:08.110 --> 06:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do to protect
 
06:38:10.230 --> 06:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
our valuable natural natural resources
 
06:38:11.110 --> 06:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
06:38:12.990 --> 06:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I will say I was a little
 
06:38:16.190 --> 06:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
discouraged by uh Mr Nikolai earlier
 
06:38:19.430 --> 06:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
from Cella saying that you know uh we
 
06:38:20.990 --> 06:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
won't be able to see anything in two and
 
06:38:23.670 --> 06:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
a half decades well I'm here I'm here
 
06:38:26.548 --> 06:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
testifying F not because of for myself
 
06:38:28.990 --> 06:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
for my own benefit but for the benefit
 
06:38:31.310 --> 06:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
of my kids and the grandkids that in two
 
06:38:33.590 --> 06:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
and a half decades they be able to enjoy
 
06:38:36.868 --> 06:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
that Forest Lake Park without any
 
06:38:39.350 --> 06:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
issues uh Mr Swan earlier from safe
 
06:38:41.430 --> 06:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake mentioned also that this
 
06:38:43.030 --> 06:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill will dictate whether or not any
 
06:38:45.110 --> 06:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
other state park in the near future will
 
06:38:46.788 --> 06:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
suffer from the same piece of
 
06:38:48.590 --> 06:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and I think that's really
 
06:38:51.468 --> 06:38:51.478 align:start position:0%
important at the same time I'm a
 
06:38:53.468 --> 06:38:53.478 align:start position:0%
Hospitality manager up here in the North
 
06:38:56.388 --> 06:38:56.398 align:start position:0%
country one of those grand hotels and I
 
06:38:58.788 --> 06:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
can tell you that building a landfill
 
06:39:00.468 --> 06:39:00.478 align:start position:0%
will be extremely detrimental to the
 
06:39:02.110 --> 06:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
tourism industry here in
 
06:39:04.190 --> 06:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire imagine for example this
 
06:39:05.868 --> 06:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
property like uh the mountain bu Grand
 
06:39:07.830 --> 06:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
where you're sitting on the balcony
 
06:39:10.310 --> 06:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
spending $400 or $500 a night and you're
 
06:39:12.350 --> 06:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
enjoying the beautiful presidential
 
06:39:14.708 --> 06:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
range in Mount Lafayette and then over
 
06:39:16.468 --> 06:39:16.478 align:start position:0%
the West Corner you'll see a
 
06:39:18.510 --> 06:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
landfill what's going to do that to the
 
06:39:20.750 --> 06:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
tourism industry to local restaurants to
 
06:39:22.670 --> 06:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
souvenir shops to local shops in the
 
06:39:24.750 --> 06:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
area uh I don't I think putting a
 
06:39:27.510 --> 06:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
Landfield Hill will be really really the
 
06:39:28.670 --> 06:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
wrong thing to
 
06:39:31.030 --> 06:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
do uh at the same time I do a lot of
 
06:39:33.070 --> 06:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
conferences a lot of catering events a
 
06:39:35.990 --> 06:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
lot of uh Gatherings uh obviously we due
 
06:39:37.910 --> 06:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
to co those those are kind of slow right
 
06:39:40.948 --> 06:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
now but in the past every time they ask
 
06:39:43.430 --> 06:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
me uh where can we go to you know to
 
06:39:46.270 --> 06:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
find some outdoor recreation and always
 
06:39:49.070 --> 06:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
Forest Lake in the presidential range is
 
06:39:50.948 --> 06:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
one of those spots where I will send
 
06:39:52.388 --> 06:39:52.398 align:start position:0%
people to
 
06:39:55.070 --> 06:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
go Forest Lake is a place where my son
 
06:39:57.070 --> 06:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
learned how to swim my daughter learned
 
06:39:57.910 --> 06:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
how to
 
06:40:00.150 --> 06:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
fish I want to invite every single one
 
06:40:01.990 --> 06:40:02.000 align:start position:0%

fantes yes representative B thank thank
 
06:40:55.990 --> 06:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr FES for
 
06:40:59.190 --> 06:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm very
 
06:41:01.190 --> 06:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
appreciative that you mentioned the
 
06:41:04.670 --> 06:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
prior testimony of of Mr Nikolai when he
 
06:41:07.030 --> 06:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
stated that the height of the landfill
 
06:41:09.708 --> 06:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
um is such that it will not be
 
06:41:13.510 --> 06:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
seen for I think he said 24 years I'm
 
06:41:15.708 --> 06:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
curious since you've been to Forest Lake
 
06:41:18.110 --> 06:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
State Park um do you think it's likely
 
06:41:20.310 --> 06:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
that you would see swarms of Seagulls
 
06:41:23.310 --> 06:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
flying above the the site of the the
 
06:41:27.910 --> 06:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:30.150 --> 06:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
metric I do think so I think that's
 
06:41:32.750 --> 06:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
possible I'm not a uh engineer a
 
06:41:34.910 --> 06:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
forestry management person like I said
 
06:41:37.388 --> 06:41:37.398 align:start position:0%
I'm a Hospitality manager but I can I
 
06:41:39.788 --> 06:41:39.798 align:start position:0%
can see that I go kayaking all the time
 
06:41:42.628 --> 06:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
and you can see Mountains for Miles if
 
06:41:44.070 --> 06:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
you're on the lake so I think that's
 
06:41:46.868 --> 06:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
that's a possibility uh I don't know the
 
06:41:48.388 --> 06:41:48.398 align:start position:0%
technicalities of it but I I'm pretty
 
06:41:51.388 --> 06:41:51.398 align:start position:0%
sure that that's possible
 
06:41:57.468 --> 06:41:57.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:00.270 --> 06:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
T all right not seeing any thank you sir
 
06:42:03.990 --> 06:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
for coming in thank you minute Mr I'm
 
06:42:08.388 --> 06:42:08.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:11.708 --> 06:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
C yeah sorry thanks for taking myh
 
06:42:13.670 --> 06:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair and uh thank you Mr
 
06:42:16.948 --> 06:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
Fuentes uh I appreciate your your
 
06:42:19.628 --> 06:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
um your uh point of view as a
 
06:42:21.388 --> 06:42:21.398 align:start position:0%
Hospitality manager and someone involved
 
06:42:23.150 --> 06:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
in that industry in the North Country I
 
06:42:24.670 --> 06:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could just uh give
 
06:42:27.230 --> 06:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
me your opinion on we've heard some
 
06:42:29.670 --> 06:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
testimony from residents of Dalton uh
 
06:42:31.750 --> 06:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
who are talking about the benefits that
 
06:42:33.468 --> 06:42:33.478 align:start position:0%
would come to certain you know certain
 
06:42:34.670 --> 06:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
benefits that would come to the town
 
06:42:37.030 --> 06:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
from the sighting of the landfill uh
 
06:42:39.788 --> 06:42:39.798 align:start position:0%
because of Dalton's you know low income
 
06:42:44.110 --> 06:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
status um do you think that perhaps you
 
06:42:45.910 --> 06:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
know it benefits private companies to
 
06:42:49.510 --> 06:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
seek out uh seek out towns and regions
 
06:42:52.350 --> 06:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
where people are needy in that way in
 
06:42:54.948 --> 06:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
that way when they when they come to try
 
06:42:57.590 --> 06:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
to seek permits to get site sites for
 
06:42:59.150 --> 06:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
landfills like that you think that's an
 
06:43:02.030 --> 06:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
advantage represent we we lost Mr
 
06:43:09.388 --> 06:43:09.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:22.670 --> 06:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:22.680 --> 06:43:27.628 align:start position:0%
 
Morrison

06:43:27.628 --> 06:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:30.150 --> 06:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay you can so you have
 
06:43:32.628 --> 06:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
three minutes go ahead thank you I'll
 
06:43:34.548 --> 06:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
try and do it in
 
06:43:37.430 --> 06:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
two um there's been a lot said this
 
06:43:41.350 --> 06:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon um I I clearly uh would uh
 
06:43:43.110 --> 06:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage you to approve House
 
06:43:43.120 --> 06:43:44.510 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage you to approve House
Bill

06:43:44.510 --> 06:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:43:46.990 --> 06:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
177 uh I would remind everybody that
 
06:43:50.910 --> 06:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 177 is not a ban on landfills
 
06:43:52.628 --> 06:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
it's really a protection for one of our
 
06:43:54.990 --> 06:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
most precious assets which is our state
 
06:43:57.830 --> 06:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
parks and their surrounding areas I
 
06:43:59.310 --> 06:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
think this is a very common sense
 
06:44:01.990 --> 06:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
approach to what is having listen to
 
06:44:04.150 --> 06:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
this for the last three hours um it
 
06:44:06.628 --> 06:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
seems like a very complicated uh subject
 
06:44:08.830 --> 06:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
matter but the more I think about it I
 
06:44:11.548 --> 06:44:11.558 align:start position:0%
also think that this is basically common
 
06:44:13.388 --> 06:44:13.398 align:start position:0%
sense I would ask the committee to think
 
06:44:15.388 --> 06:44:15.398 align:start position:0%
about does it make any sense at all to
 
06:44:16.468 --> 06:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
you to
 
06:44:20.788 --> 06:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
situate a very large uh landfill very
 
06:44:23.150 --> 06:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
close within hundreds of yards of a
 
06:44:25.788 --> 06:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
state par park or a body of water that
 
06:44:29.788 --> 06:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
is used by the public in great numbers
 
06:44:31.670 --> 06:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that makes no sense at
 
06:44:33.150 --> 06:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
all and there's got to be a better
 
06:44:35.628 --> 06:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
solution I would also remind everybody
 
06:44:38.270 --> 06:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
that this legislation actually started
 
06:44:40.150 --> 06:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
before any permitting process started
 
06:44:43.750 --> 06:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's come up several times that um you
 
06:44:45.310 --> 06:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
know we're changing the rules of the
 
06:44:47.868 --> 06:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
game that's not necessarily true the
 
06:44:49.910 --> 06:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislation for this bill its
 
06:44:52.230 --> 06:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
predecessor was passed through the house
 
06:44:55.110 --> 06:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
and if it wasn't for the covid-19
 
06:44:57.310 --> 06:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic um this all would have happened
 
06:44:59.590 --> 06:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
long before any permanent process had
 
06:45:01.830 --> 06:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
started I think this is very smart
 
06:45:04.070 --> 06:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
legislation I think it's uh it's
 
06:45:06.150 --> 06:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
something that's very needed and I think
 
06:45:07.310 --> 06:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
if you talk to
 
06:45:09.990 --> 06:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
Dees their their set of rules there's a
 
06:45:11.510 --> 06:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's a there's no question there's an
 
06:45:13.070 --> 06:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
exhaustive set of rules for getting a
 
06:45:16.030 --> 06:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
permit but that's a dynamic situation
 
06:45:17.670 --> 06:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's subject to change and I
 
06:45:20.830 --> 06:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
think as a legislative body it's one of
 
06:45:24.510 --> 06:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
the previous speakers asked you to be uh
 
06:45:26.670 --> 06:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
caretakers of the land and to be and now
 
06:45:28.310 --> 06:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
is the time to step up so I would
 
06:45:31.548 --> 06:45:31.558 align:start position:0%
encourage you to do that any any
 
06:45:34.510 --> 06:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
permitting process that would allow um a
 
06:45:36.548 --> 06:45:36.558 align:start position:0%
large landfill to be placed this close
 
06:45:38.670 --> 06:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
to a state park or this close to Forest
 
06:45:41.150 --> 06:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
Lake makes no sense at all to me and
 
06:45:42.830 --> 06:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the science is and whatever
 
06:45:46.788 --> 06:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
Goodwill and positive intent uh cassella
 
06:45:48.948 --> 06:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
or any other of the landfill developers
 
06:45:52.948 --> 06:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
have um their their best laid plans if
 
06:45:55.070 --> 06:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
something go South there's there there
 
06:45:56.868 --> 06:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
is no remedy for it and it just doesn't
 
06:45:58.990 --> 06:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
make sense to put th those precious
 
06:46:01.230 --> 06:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
resources at risk I would encourage you
 
06:46:05.190 --> 06:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
to please pass House Bill 177 thank
 
06:46:12.948 --> 06:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:15.190 --> 06:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
Marson all right not seeing any thank
 
06:46:15.200 --> 06:46:16.548 align:start position:0%
Marson all right not seeing any thank
you

06:46:16.548 --> 06:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:46:19.190 --> 06:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
sir next we'll bring up fredd Anderson
 
06:46:21.990 --> 06:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
so we have three more uh three more
 
06:46:24.708 --> 06:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
people to testify for the committee I'll
 
06:46:27.468 --> 06:46:27.478 align:start position:0%
just remind the last three of you if
 
06:46:28.708 --> 06:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
you're going to repeat something that
 
06:46:30.750 --> 06:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
someone else has said before just let's
 
06:46:32.750 --> 06:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
try and keep it brief min's been sitting
 
06:46:34.750 --> 06:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
here for nearly three hours and we still
 
06:46:36.430 --> 06:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
have work to do after this so I'd like
 
06:46:38.388 --> 06:46:38.398 align:start position:0%
to wrap up fairly quickly if we could
 
06:46:39.910 --> 06:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
not that I want to limit anyone speech
 
06:46:41.708 --> 06:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
but let let's try and stick to new
 
06:46:43.548 --> 06:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
points and just touch on the highlights
 
06:46:52.310 --> 06:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:52.320 --> 06:46:55.468 align:start position:0%
 
Anderson

06:46:55.468 --> 06:46:55.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:57.708 --> 06:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
can you hear me I can Mr Anderson go
 
06:46:59.590 --> 06:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
ahead you have three minutes my name is
 
06:47:03.388 --> 06:47:03.398 align:start position:0%
Fred Anderson uh I have lived on Forest
 
06:47:06.708 --> 06:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
Lake off and on since 1977 when we
 
06:47:09.590 --> 06:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
bought a camp here we built a retirement
 
06:47:12.070 --> 06:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
home here 14 years ago I would have
 
06:47:15.150 --> 06:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
never done that had I any notion of a
 
06:47:18.510 --> 06:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
landfill being put what will be within
 
06:47:23.070 --> 06:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
probably a half mile of my front yard uh
 
06:47:24.990 --> 06:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm here to talk to you you've heard
 
06:47:27.070 --> 06:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
lots of things by the way I'm also
 
06:47:30.388 --> 06:47:30.398 align:start position:0%
president of the Forest Lake Association
 
06:47:32.230 --> 06:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
you've heard from a lot of my fellow
 
06:47:34.190 --> 06:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
friends on this Lake about what this
 
06:47:36.750 --> 06:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
means about prevailing RNs you've heard
 
06:47:38.868 --> 06:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
about people that have grown up here all
 
06:47:42.070 --> 06:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
their life we've raised our kids here I
 
06:47:43.628 --> 06:47:43.638 align:start position:0%
want to talk to you about three things I
 
06:47:44.910 --> 06:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
want to talk to you about the
 
06:47:47.590 --> 06:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
environment I want to talk to you about
 
06:47:50.628 --> 06:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
the ecology and I want to talk to you
 
06:47:53.750 --> 06:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
about the economy I'm really just stress
 
06:47:56.270 --> 06:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
that is Cella has talked about all of
 
06:47:59.070 --> 06:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
this with all their fancy monitoring
 
06:48:02.150 --> 06:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
Wells and whatever they keep slipping by
 
06:48:04.990 --> 06:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
the possibility of these other things I
 
06:48:09.388 --> 06:48:09.398 align:start position:0%
want to talk about what happens when the
 
06:48:11.468 --> 06:48:11.478 align:start position:0%
stuff that goes into the ground by the
 
06:48:13.110 --> 06:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
way it's going to be there a lot longer
 
06:48:15.150 --> 06:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
than 35 years it's going to be there a
 
06:48:17.030 --> 06:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
lot longer than I'm going to be here I
 
06:48:18.510 --> 06:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
dare say it's going to be there a lot
 
06:48:21.350 --> 06:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
longer of any of you we're being called
 
06:48:24.708 --> 06:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
upon here to be stewards of this gift to
 
06:48:27.788 --> 06:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
us but there's this thing called
 
06:48:27.798 --> 06:48:29.388 align:start position:0%
us but there's this thing called
atmospheric

06:48:29.388 --> 06:48:29.398 align:start position:0%
atmospheric
 
06:48:32.468 --> 06:48:32.478 align:start position:0%
deposition that stuff you throw dirt on
 
06:48:34.990 --> 06:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
top of it but it continues to decompose
 
06:48:38.030 --> 06:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
and release gases it releases methane it
 
06:48:40.868 --> 06:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
releases carbon dioxide two of the most
 
06:48:44.750 --> 06:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
critical chemicals in terms of of global
 
06:48:47.190 --> 06:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
warming and in terms of carbon
 
06:48:49.948 --> 06:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
footprints for Earth rain if that
 
06:48:52.468 --> 06:48:52.478 align:start position:0%
landfill goes in here this Lake will be
 
06:48:56.070 --> 06:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
dead Within 30 to 50 years I guarantee
 
06:48:58.708 --> 06:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
you why because they can't control the
 
06:49:01.310 --> 06:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
leeching of that yes we know what those
 
06:49:04.310 --> 06:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
candy cane white PVC car things look
 
06:49:06.750 --> 06:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
like all over these and of course but
 
06:49:10.150 --> 06:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
the ground is releasing this gas and
 
06:49:13.350 --> 06:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
this gas then when the water hits it
 
06:49:16.110 --> 06:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
turns it into acid rain and then we're
 
06:49:18.868 --> 06:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
talking about posos that's also being
 
06:49:21.468 --> 06:49:21.478 align:start position:0%
generated and blown into the air and yes
 
06:49:23.310 --> 06:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
the prevailing winds come from the the
 
06:49:25.590 --> 06:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
north down across the South I live in
 
06:49:27.468 --> 06:49:27.478 align:start position:0%
the south end on the west side of the
 
06:49:29.310 --> 06:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
lake I can tell you exactly what the
 
06:49:31.628 --> 06:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
prevailing winds are they're not what
 
06:49:33.750 --> 06:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
cassella tells you are and they don't
 
06:49:36.868 --> 06:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
change that often two I want to talk
 
06:49:38.948 --> 06:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
about the ecology what's the difference
 
06:49:41.350 --> 06:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
between ecology and environment it's the
 
06:49:43.708 --> 06:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
way the environment decomposition
 
06:49:46.788 --> 06:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
problems interact with the biosphere the
 
06:49:48.670 --> 06:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
biosphere has to do not only with
 
06:49:50.628 --> 06:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
Wildlife not only with fish not only
 
06:49:53.230 --> 06:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
with game but with you and me and we're
 
06:49:55.150 --> 06:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
talking about cancer we're talking about
 
06:49:57.270 --> 06:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
a whole series of other problems not the
 
06:49:59.510 --> 06:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
least of which would happen and of
 
06:50:01.830 --> 06:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
course the whole issue of water leeching
 
06:50:04.150 --> 06:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
into the landfill you've heard that the
 
06:50:07.190 --> 06:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
EPA says these things leak sooner or
 
06:50:11.110 --> 06:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
later they leak a 100 to 200 years is
 
06:50:13.310 --> 06:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here possibly
 
06:50:15.350 --> 06:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
longer I don't think we have anyone in
 
06:50:17.070 --> 06:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
the industry who can tell us what will
 
06:50:20.510 --> 06:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
be happening in 100 to 200 years no how
 
06:50:22.110 --> 06:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
no matter how scientific they're trying
 
06:50:25.628 --> 06:50:25.638 align:start position:0%
to be the last issue is economic you've
 
06:50:28.230 --> 06:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
heard it I don't need to repeat it you
 
06:50:31.350 --> 06:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
know how dependent the state is on
 
06:50:34.708 --> 06:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
tourism dollars and Recreation dollars I
 
06:50:36.590 --> 06:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
feel a little passionate I think you can
 
06:50:39.190 --> 06:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
hear it let me be clear I live within
 
06:50:41.590 --> 06:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
less than a while of where this place is
 
06:50:43.948 --> 06:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
envisioned to go it's
 
06:50:47.910 --> 06:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
180 acres and that's the same size of
 
06:50:50.628 --> 06:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
the lake and then there will be all the
 
06:50:53.388 --> 06:50:53.398 align:start position:0%
applications later for wanting to EXP B
 
06:50:55.868 --> 06:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
it talk to the people in Bethlehem about
 
06:50:57.948 --> 06:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
what life has been like with this group
 
06:50:59.788 --> 06:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
of people ladies and gentlemen thank you
 
06:51:02.590 --> 06:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you for your work
 
06:51:05.190 --> 06:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for caring for the people
 
06:51:06.910 --> 06:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
and the resources of the State of New
 
06:51:09.110 --> 06:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is there any questions from Mr
 
06:51:09.120 --> 06:51:10.468 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is there any questions from Mr
Anderson

06:51:10.468 --> 06:51:10.478 align:start position:0%
Anderson
 
06:51:12.750 --> 06:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
06:51:14.868 --> 06:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Anderson for your testimony
 
06:51:17.548 --> 06:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
and for taking my question um I I've
 
06:51:19.430 --> 06:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
heard it a few times now A lot of people
 
06:51:22.030 --> 06:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
seem to live out their retirement years
 
06:51:25.350 --> 06:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
up there in in in dalon by the lake and
 
06:51:26.948 --> 06:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
uh another thing I know is that a lot of
 
06:51:29.030 --> 06:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
people uh for a lot of people a
 
06:51:30.788 --> 06:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
significant portion of their life
 
06:51:33.788 --> 06:51:33.798 align:start position:0%
savings uh is is in their home uh what
 
06:51:35.868 --> 06:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
do you think will happen to property
 
06:51:38.990 --> 06:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
value forth Lake if a landfill is placed
 
06:51:41.590 --> 06:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
nearby oh they'll drop
 
06:51:43.910 --> 06:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically and the concern about
 
06:51:47.030 --> 06:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
property up here will suddenly cease to
 
06:51:48.750 --> 06:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
be who's going to want to come up here
 
06:51:51.868 --> 06:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
and build a house next to a landfill yes
 
06:51:54.510 --> 06:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
I retired up here we came up here for
 
06:51:56.628 --> 06:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
almost 40 years before I retired I'm a
 
06:51:58.948 --> 06:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
presbyterian Minister we were up here a
 
06:52:00.590 --> 06:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
week to two weeks to three weeks in the
 
06:52:03.510 --> 06:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
summer finally for the whole summer I
 
06:52:05.070 --> 06:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
would have never invested the money I
 
06:52:06.708 --> 06:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
invested in this house had I known there
 
06:52:09.270 --> 06:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
was going to be a landfill next to it
 
06:52:11.468 --> 06:52:11.478 align:start position:0%
and I'm not a wealthy man I'm not an
 
06:52:13.750 --> 06:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
elite I'm not the kinds of folks the
 
06:52:16.430 --> 06:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
folks by the way were testifying to and
 
06:52:18.628 --> 06:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
by the way I was at that meeting in
 
06:52:21.948 --> 06:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
Dalton and there was no violence I was
 
06:52:24.150 --> 06:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
holding one of the signs urging the
 
06:52:27.708 --> 06:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
people of Dalton to vote for zoning so I
 
06:52:29.830 --> 06:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
think that's being misrepresented thank
 
06:52:32.468 --> 06:52:32.478 align:start position:0%
you for your question thank you Mr any
 
06:52:35.590 --> 06:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr
 
06:52:38.030 --> 06:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
hon right seeing none thank you sir we
 
06:52:40.590 --> 06:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thank you so
 
06:52:43.750 --> 06:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
much all right is Adam
 
06:52:47.350 --> 06:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
F yes can you hear me you can that quick
 
06:52:51.110 --> 06:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank thank you uh Dr Adam finl I'm a a
 
06:52:53.590 --> 06:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
Dalton resident voter uh professor of
 
06:52:55.070 --> 06:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
environmental health science at
 
06:52:56.948 --> 06:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
University of Michigan remotely of
 
06:52:58.910 --> 06:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
course formerly taught at Princeton Penn
 
06:53:01.868 --> 06:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
and Harvard uh I'm not anti- landfill I
 
06:53:03.430 --> 06:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire might well need one
 
06:53:05.708 --> 06:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
or more landfills somewhere in the state
 
06:53:07.468 --> 06:53:07.478 align:start position:0%
over the next 30 to 50 years but the
 
06:53:09.230 --> 06:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
difference to Public Health and the
 
06:53:11.708 --> 06:53:11.718 align:start position:0%
economy from a sensibly cited landfill
 
06:53:14.190 --> 06:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
and a poorly cited one is enormous there
 
06:53:15.910 --> 06:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
are millions of Acres available land in
 
06:53:18.548 --> 06:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
our state uh and all this fill does of
 
06:53:20.030 --> 06:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
course is to say that a very tiny
 
06:53:22.190 --> 06:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of that land among the most
 
06:53:23.868 --> 06:53:23.878 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and valuable portions of it
 
06:53:26.030 --> 06:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
should be off limits to new commercial
 
06:53:28.150 --> 06:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
construction Mr changaris is just wrong
 
06:53:30.350 --> 06:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's a one paragraph bill that does not
 
06:53:32.590 --> 06:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
say anything about uh Banning private
 
06:53:35.670 --> 06:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
landfills it bans it in 79 two M circles
 
06:53:37.948 --> 06:53:37.958 align:start position:0%
around our state parks I want to make
 
06:53:39.708 --> 06:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
one quick point about economics I
 
06:53:41.030 --> 06:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
actually helped invent some of the
 
06:53:43.150 --> 06:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
methods used to do cost benefit analysis
 
06:53:46.270 --> 06:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
in the 1980s this bill has zero cost and
 
06:53:49.030 --> 06:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
it won't kill a single job many states
 
06:53:50.708 --> 06:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
and towns forbid liquor stores from
 
06:53:52.350 --> 06:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
being built next to churches or schools
 
06:53:54.270 --> 06:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
no one have the go to claim that's a job
 
06:53:56.270 --> 06:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
killing restriction the total number of
 
06:53:58.590 --> 06:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
liquor stores won't change if a tiny
 
06:54:00.468 --> 06:54:00.478 align:start position:0%
percentage of all possible places are
 
06:54:03.468 --> 06:54:03.478 align:start position:0%
denied to them uh when you guys debated
 
06:54:05.708 --> 06:54:05.718 align:start position:0%
this bill uh last year I heard criticism
 
06:54:08.430 --> 06:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
that two miles is arbitrary with all due
 
06:54:10.788 --> 06:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
respect this doesn't make sense to me if
 
06:54:12.270 --> 06:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
I could offer an analogy it's like
 
06:54:13.788 --> 06:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
saying what speed limit should we have
 
06:54:16.030 --> 06:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
in front of a grammar school in a case
 
06:54:18.150 --> 06:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
where the current law allows drivers to
 
06:54:20.388 --> 06:54:20.398 align:start position:0%
speed past the school at 75 miles an
 
06:54:22.788 --> 06:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
hour there's no magic number for what a
 
06:54:24.430 --> 06:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
lower limit should be but surely
 
06:54:26.590 --> 06:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
legislators can choose a better number
 
06:54:29.388 --> 06:54:29.398 align:start position:0%
than 75 miles per hour so what's the
 
06:54:32.190 --> 06:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
current code the dees code says you can
 
06:54:35.190 --> 06:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
put a landfill 200 feet uh from a
 
06:54:37.190 --> 06:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
permanent water body so all this bill
 
06:54:39.310 --> 06:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
does is increase that arbitrary setback
 
06:54:42.510 --> 06:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
by a factor of about 50 fold is that too
 
06:54:44.270 --> 06:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
protective not protective enough give me
 
06:54:46.868 --> 06:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
one minute and I'll try and explain it
 
06:54:48.430 --> 06:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
when considering the inevitable leaks
 
06:54:50.270 --> 06:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
from a landfill it's it might be helpful
 
06:54:52.070 --> 06:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
to think not in terms of units of
 
06:54:54.868 --> 06:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
distance but units of time how much time
 
06:54:56.150 --> 06:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
might it take for contaminated
 
06:54:59.830 --> 06:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater to move 200 ft so here's an
 
06:55:01.670 --> 06:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
accurate quote quote depending on
 
06:55:03.708 --> 06:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
various factors it can take weeks months
 
06:55:05.670 --> 06:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
or even years for groundwater to move as
 
06:55:08.430 --> 06:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
little as 100 feet end quote I found
 
06:55:10.110 --> 06:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
that quote in a legal brief written by
 
06:55:12.110 --> 06:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
cassella in defense of A Clean Water Act
 
06:55:14.270 --> 06:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
complaint made against it so that's
 
06:55:16.948 --> 06:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
their quote so at let's let's forget
 
06:55:18.548 --> 06:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
about weeks let's be generous and use
 
06:55:20.468 --> 06:55:20.478 align:start position:0%
months two months for 100 feet is of
 
06:55:23.150 --> 06:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
course 50 feet a month so at 50 ft per
 
06:55:26.270 --> 06:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
month 200t provides the state only four
 
06:55:28.948 --> 06:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
months to detect and avert contamination
 
06:55:30.868 --> 06:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
this is obviously unreasonable but with
 
06:55:32.750 --> 06:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
a two mile buffer you might have 18
 
06:55:35.190 --> 06:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
years to find and fix this may not be
 
06:55:38.430 --> 06:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
enough time to detect the problem and
 
06:55:40.150 --> 06:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
with great expense intercept the plume
 
06:55:41.388 --> 06:55:41.398 align:start position:0%
of groundwater and block it from
 
06:55:42.750 --> 06:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
reaching the surface water but at least
 
06:55:45.548 --> 06:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
18 years gives you a fighting chance so
 
06:55:47.708 --> 06:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
the choice between let's quote four
 
06:55:50.670 --> 06:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
months and quote 18 years is exactly the
 
06:55:52.788 --> 06:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
kind of choice that you were elected to
 
06:55:55.590 --> 06:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
make and I submit that uh increasing
 
06:55:59.708 --> 06:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
that temporal setback uh is a I won't
 
06:56:01.150 --> 06:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
call it a no-brainer but it's it's
 
06:56:03.310 --> 06:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
Common Sense let me make two more very
 
06:56:05.070 --> 06:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
quick points about setbacks and I'll
 
06:56:07.670 --> 06:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
stop uh no one's brought this up yet
 
06:56:09.628 --> 06:56:09.638 align:start position:0%
today for 20 years there's been a
 
06:56:11.868 --> 06:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
federal law prohibiting new landfill
 
06:56:13.590 --> 06:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
construction public or private within
 
06:56:16.270 --> 06:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
six miles of a general aviation airport
 
06:56:18.388 --> 06:56:18.398 align:start position:0%
this is about concern of course about
 
06:56:21.070 --> 06:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
pressible waste and seagulls I've
 
06:56:22.468 --> 06:56:22.478 align:start position:0%
actually studied the risks of bird
 
06:56:23.910 --> 06:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
strikes at airports they're very
 
06:56:26.628 --> 06:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
uncommon I looked at the faa's database
 
06:56:28.868 --> 06:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
today there have been no bird strikes in
 
06:56:30.910 --> 06:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire ever that have caused
 
06:56:33.030 --> 06:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
injury to human beings but nevertheless
 
06:56:36.750 --> 06:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
we protect airports to a six mile uh
 
06:56:39.628 --> 06:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
radius and right now Landfield rivers
 
06:56:42.830 --> 06:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
and streams and lakes only to 200 feet
 
06:56:44.270 --> 06:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
it actually turns out in Dalton if
 
06:56:46.548 --> 06:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
cassella wanted to locate 2011 feet from
 
06:56:48.030 --> 06:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
the West Shore of Forest Lake they
 
06:56:50.590 --> 06:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that not thanks to Dees but
 
06:56:52.990 --> 06:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
because the Whitefield region airport is
 
06:56:55.628 --> 06:56:55.638 align:start position:0%
just six miles and and little under six
 
06:56:57.190 --> 06:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
miles from the from the closest from the
 
06:57:00.750 --> 06:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
furthest point of the shore one more qu
 
06:57:02.868 --> 06:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
point and I'll stop uh I put in my
 
06:57:04.910 --> 06:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
written testimony and as attachment a
 
06:57:06.510 --> 06:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
recent study from Duke University
 
06:57:08.910 --> 06:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
talking about a seagull waste and the
 
06:57:10.670 --> 06:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and nitrogen they add to Lake
 
06:57:13.030 --> 06:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
water someone mentioned uh Forest Lake
 
06:57:14.990 --> 06:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
had its first recorded ever harmful
 
06:57:18.110 --> 06:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
algal bloom last summer after a quick
 
06:57:20.150 --> 06:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
sudden rainstorm washed some soil into
 
06:57:22.510 --> 06:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
the lake so I strongly suspect that that
 
06:57:23.868 --> 06:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
even a two-mile setback will be
 
06:57:25.468 --> 06:57:25.478 align:start position:0%
insufficient to prevent seagulls from
 
06:57:28.310 --> 06:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
being attracted to the water bodies and
 
06:57:29.990 --> 06:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
a harmful algal bloom as you may know
 
06:57:31.750 --> 06:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's not only dangerous to humans and
 
06:57:34.070 --> 06:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
potentially deadly to household pets but
 
06:57:35.628 --> 06:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
it's an early stage in the process of
 
06:57:38.070 --> 06:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
urif foration if allowed to continue
 
06:57:39.990 --> 06:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
that will not inaccurately be called a
 
06:57:42.468 --> 06:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
dead lake so thank you for the chance to
 
06:57:44.948 --> 06:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
explain why this bill is a cost benefit
 
06:57:46.468 --> 06:57:46.478 align:start position:0%
choice that has substantial public
 
06:57:49.430 --> 06:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
benefits zero public costs and no
 
06:57:51.670 --> 06:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
private cost whatsoever that can't be
 
06:57:53.628 --> 06:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
erased merely by developers choosing
 
06:57:56.030 --> 06:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
from among the vast number of sensible
 
06:57:58.230 --> 06:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
alternative sites thank you for your
 
06:58:00.750 --> 06:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr frer will you take
 
06:58:02.230 --> 06:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
some questions from the board of course
 
06:58:04.548 --> 06:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
06:58:07.948 --> 06:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes uh thank you uh Mr chair thank
 
06:58:12.310 --> 06:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr fle for taking my question um
 
06:58:14.388 --> 06:58:14.398 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned the issue of cost
 
06:58:17.910 --> 06:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis and one of the benefits
 
06:58:20.948 --> 06:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
that was cited of the landfill was that
 
06:58:23.310 --> 06:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
it would provide an increased inre in
 
06:58:25.990 --> 06:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
tax base and tax income to this town of
 
06:58:31.708 --> 06:58:31.718 align:start position:0%
Dalton uh one of the uh downside U costs
 
06:58:36.750 --> 06:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
that was cited by other um uh testifiers
 
06:58:39.708 --> 06:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
was that uh it would have a damaging
 
06:58:43.510 --> 06:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
effect on the tourism economy around in
 
06:58:47.708 --> 06:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
that in the um Dalton White Field area
 
06:58:51.230 --> 06:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh do you have a sense of how these
 
06:58:53.948 --> 06:58:53.958 align:start position:0%
compare well any sense that I would have
 
06:58:55.990 --> 06:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
would be impressionistic I think they're
 
06:58:59.628 --> 06:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
both large potential sums I think the
 
06:59:01.350 --> 06:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
experience in Bethlehem has been that
 
06:59:03.510 --> 06:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
the promises of of money have not been
 
06:59:05.230 --> 06:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
borne out but I'm trying to make a
 
06:59:06.990 --> 06:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat different point this is a state
 
06:59:09.708 --> 06:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
bill and we are focused on one project
 
06:59:11.510 --> 06:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
but all I'm trying to say here is that
 
06:59:14.590 --> 06:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
whatever uh economic harms and goods
 
06:59:17.948 --> 06:59:17.958 align:start position:0%
come from a proposed landfill in Dalton
 
06:59:20.030 --> 06:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
just by putting this two mile barrier
 
06:59:23.270 --> 06:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
around state parks that cost and benefit
 
06:59:24.788 --> 06:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
will just occur someplace else from a
 
06:59:27.868 --> 06:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
state point of view this is a zero some
 
06:59:30.910 --> 06:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh non-impact again this is about 1 to
 
06:59:33.708 --> 06:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
2% of the land area of the state these
 
06:59:36.150 --> 06:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
companies can locate in the other 98%
 
06:59:38.628 --> 06:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
with with no problem at all it's just
 
06:59:40.708 --> 06:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
parks and landfills lakes and landfills
 
06:59:46.430 --> 06:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:48.750 --> 06:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you Senator
 
06:59:52.190 --> 06:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
B uh thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
06:59:55.388 --> 06:59:55.398 align:start position:0%
Mr finle for taking my question um I
 
06:59:56.868 --> 06:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
believe you're a professor of
 
06:59:59.548 --> 06:59:59.558 align:start position:0%
Environmental Health Sciences and I'm so
 
07:00:01.468 --> 07:00:01.478 align:start position:0%
glad that you are because I think make
 
07:00:02.910 --> 07:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
it very appropriate for ask this
 
07:00:06.788 --> 07:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
question um presented from Cella earlier
 
07:00:09.990 --> 07:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago Mr uh Fusco
 
07:00:11.788 --> 07:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
recommended that we defer to
 
07:00:15.030 --> 07:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives um of Pella as a source
 
07:00:18.110 --> 07:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
of scientific information um my daughter
 
07:00:19.628 --> 07:00:19.638 align:start position:0%
is in high school and sometimes I help
 
07:00:21.430 --> 07:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
her with her clients homework one of the
 
07:00:23.150 --> 07:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
things I've learned very recently is
 
07:00:25.510 --> 07:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
that sources of scientific information
 
07:00:27.190 --> 07:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
should not be trusted unless they are
 
07:00:29.548 --> 07:00:29.558 align:start position:0%
from an unbiased Source would you say
 
07:00:31.910 --> 07:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
that Cassel systems is an unbiased
 
07:00:35.110 --> 07:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
source of scientific information in this
 
07:00:37.590 --> 07:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
case wow that's you know that's a tough
 
07:00:40.230 --> 07:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
question because uh first of all I've
 
07:00:42.430 --> 07:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
written articles about this I actually
 
07:00:45.030 --> 07:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
am not that concerned about financial
 
07:00:46.910 --> 07:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
bias I tend to look more at whether
 
07:00:49.548 --> 07:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
people are right or wrong whether
 
07:00:50.868 --> 07:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
they're credential or not whether they
 
07:00:52.628 --> 07:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
know what they're talking about or not
 
07:00:54.030 --> 07:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a tough question for me because
 
07:00:56.230 --> 07:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
I've been sued by Cassell already for
 
07:00:59.110 --> 07:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
defamation uh simply for having been an
 
07:01:00.548 --> 07:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
association with a similar name to
 
07:01:02.070 --> 07:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
another Association we were dismissed
 
07:01:04.948 --> 07:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
from that suit and I have no qualms at
 
07:01:06.310 --> 07:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
all about talking at a legislative
 
07:01:09.510 --> 07:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
hearing uh all I will say is I have
 
07:01:12.590 --> 07:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
seen profoundly unscientific amateurish
 
07:01:14.310 --> 07:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
statements from this company already and
 
07:01:16.510 --> 07:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
I have been LED knowing nothing about
 
07:01:18.388 --> 07:01:18.398 align:start position:0%
them two years ago to mistrust them in
 
07:01:20.788 --> 07:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
the future uh the the idea that
 
07:01:24.350 --> 07:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
groundwater can't flow up Hill uh that's
 
07:01:29.270 --> 07:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
Voodoo science um it it can flow uphill
 
07:01:31.510 --> 07:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
in fractured granite and I remind you
 
07:01:33.350 --> 07:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
that I have moved now to the Granite
 
07:01:34.830 --> 07:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
State and we're talking about the
 
07:01:37.430 --> 07:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
granite state landfill so yes you need a
 
07:01:40.670 --> 07:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
good source of not only unbiased but uh
 
07:01:42.270 --> 07:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
credential and expert scientific
 
07:01:44.788 --> 07:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
information I'm happy to uh either on my
 
07:01:46.708 --> 07:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
own or through my colleagues to try try
 
07:01:49.708 --> 07:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:53.510 --> 07:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you uh representative
 
07:01:55.708 --> 07:01:55.718 align:start position:0%
verville thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
07:01:59.230 --> 07:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
Mr fingle for uh taking my question so
 
07:02:01.830 --> 07:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
we keep coming back to uh to sort of a
 
07:02:03.910 --> 07:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
similar point so I I'll ask you for your
 
07:02:06.110 --> 07:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
your opinion on the matter you say that
 
07:02:09.270 --> 07:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
landfills and parks and landfills and
 
07:02:12.388 --> 07:02:12.398 align:start position:0%
open bodies of water uh don't mix and
 
07:02:15.628 --> 07:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
that that's common sense so it's a
 
07:02:17.388 --> 07:02:17.398 align:start position:0%
two-part question do you believe that
 
07:02:22.150 --> 07:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
the bill should be amended to disallow
 
07:02:26.350 --> 07:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
landfills within 2 feet of open
 
07:02:29.590 --> 07:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
groundwater and if the bill was amended
 
07:02:33.510 --> 07:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
to say that um what percentage of land
 
07:02:35.030 --> 07:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire do you think would
 
07:02:38.590 --> 07:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
remain available for potential landfill
 
07:02:40.430 --> 07:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
development well I will definitely take
 
07:02:41.830 --> 07:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
a look at a map and try because I heard
 
07:02:43.910 --> 07:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
your question earlier today it's a good
 
07:02:45.750 --> 07:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
question how much of the state would be
 
07:02:47.548 --> 07:02:47.558 align:start position:0%
off limits if it was 2 miles from you
 
07:02:49.708 --> 07:02:49.718 align:start position:0%
said 2 feet I assume you mean two miles
 
07:02:52.910 --> 07:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
from any any permanent water B
 
07:02:56.190 --> 07:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
um all I'll say is I think state parks I
 
07:02:59.070 --> 07:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
looked at the Wikipedia page at all the
 
07:03:00.990 --> 07:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
pictures I've been to probably 15 or 20
 
07:03:02.430 --> 07:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
of these but I would say two-thirds of
 
07:03:04.110 --> 07:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
the state parks either have water body
 
07:03:06.230 --> 07:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
in their name or obvious from the
 
07:03:08.310 --> 07:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
picture there's a water body nearby and
 
07:03:10.230 --> 07:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
I assume that these particular water
 
07:03:13.190 --> 07:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
bodies were chosen for tourist value for
 
07:03:16.110 --> 07:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
ecological value for historic value so
 
07:03:17.750 --> 07:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it should be amended to
 
07:03:20.110 --> 07:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
include every body waterer in the state
 
07:03:23.230 --> 07:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
I guess my bottom line would be uh maybe
 
07:03:25.190 --> 07:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is now self-interest because of
 
07:03:26.830 --> 07:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
where I live but I'd like you to pass
 
07:03:28.628 --> 07:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
this bill now and then consider amending
 
07:03:32.750 --> 07:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
it to expand the the buffers in the
 
07:03:34.948 --> 07:03:34.958 align:start position:0%
future thank you Mr ble thank you Mr
 
07:03:37.190 --> 07:03:37.200 align:start position:0%

spe uh no question I forgot to take my
 
07:03:48.750 --> 07:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
hand down

testimony thank
 
07:04:06.690 --> 07:04:06.700 align:start position:0%

07:04:11.190 --> 07:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
Hayes ell if you could put your hand up
 
07:04:12.868 --> 07:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
on the account you want us to pull up it
 
07:04:20.750 --> 07:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:37.030 --> 07:04:37.040 align:start position:0%

07:04:50.430 --> 07:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
unmute can you hear me I'm sorry that's
 
07:04:52.190 --> 07:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay I've got you now all right
 
07:04:55.150 --> 07:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
okay um it looks like I'm batting Queen
 
07:04:58.270 --> 07:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
up and I will um have mercy on you I
 
07:05:01.110 --> 07:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
just want to make a several comments um
 
07:05:03.628 --> 07:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
the most frequent question I get when I
 
07:05:05.510 --> 07:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
tell people about the Forest Lake
 
07:05:08.830 --> 07:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
campaign is why next to a lake and a
 
07:05:11.910 --> 07:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
state park why not somewhere else and
 
07:05:14.510 --> 07:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
the only real answer we ever got from
 
07:05:16.830 --> 07:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
the developers is that they found in
 
07:05:18.948 --> 07:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
quotes a willing
 
07:05:21.708 --> 07:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
landowner someone who happened to own
 
07:05:23.990 --> 07:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
Dalton land directly abing the state
 
07:05:27.590 --> 07:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
park and was willing to sell it to them
 
07:05:30.190 --> 07:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's a terrible place in
 
07:05:33.270 --> 07:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
my opinion for a landfill has not
 
07:05:36.670 --> 07:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
stopped them and when the permit for the
 
07:05:40.430 --> 07:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
Dalton landfill is as we hope denied by
 
07:05:43.230 --> 07:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
Dees it's very likely the landfill
 
07:05:45.230 --> 07:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
developer is going to be looking for
 
07:05:47.990 --> 07:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
other willing land owners elsewhere in
 
07:05:50.230 --> 07:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and as we all know there
 
07:05:53.510 --> 07:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
are vast tracks of privately owned land
 
07:05:56.350 --> 07:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
throughout New England as well as in New
 
07:05:58.948 --> 07:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire land that could easily host a
 
07:06:01.070 --> 07:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
for profit
 
07:06:04.030 --> 07:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
landfill and there's undoubtedly many
 
07:06:06.388 --> 07:06:06.398 align:start position:0%
more willing land
 
07:06:11.190 --> 07:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
owners and to bring HB 177 back to
 
07:06:13.110 --> 07:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
something that provides Statewide
 
07:06:16.910 --> 07:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
benefits for all of us HB 177 will
 
07:06:18.990 --> 07:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that wherever New Hampshire's
 
07:06:22.190 --> 07:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
next for-profit landfill is permitted
 
07:06:25.270 --> 07:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
it will be at least two miles away from
 
07:06:27.948 --> 07:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
the state parks inner near your
 
07:06:32.070 --> 07:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
District um I want to respond quickly to
 
07:06:34.150 --> 07:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
the notion that we are trying to change
 
07:06:36.030 --> 07:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
the rules in
 
07:06:40.030 --> 07:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
Midstream uh we as you probably know
 
07:06:42.270 --> 07:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
started this last year before any
 
07:06:45.628 --> 07:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
permits were ever uh submitted and we
 
07:06:47.830 --> 07:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
hope that you will consider that oneyear
 
07:06:50.990 --> 07:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
delay due to covid when you think about
 
07:06:54.150 --> 07:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
the notion of us trying to change in
 
07:06:58.388 --> 07:06:58.398 align:start position:0%
Midstream um while we were silenced by
 
07:07:00.750 --> 07:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
covid and while things were stalled with
 
07:07:04.430 --> 07:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
the state legislature Cella of course
 
07:07:07.388 --> 07:07:07.398 align:start position:0%
went full stream ahead with all the work
 
07:07:10.868 --> 07:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
they needed to do so there is a mismatch
 
07:07:13.990 --> 07:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
now and uh please do think about the
 
07:07:17.310 --> 07:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
fact that we tried to start this last
 
07:07:21.548 --> 07:07:21.558 align:start position:0%
year and that's about all I want to say
 
07:07:24.070 --> 07:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
except to remind you that each of you is
 
07:07:27.270 --> 07:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
only one willing landowner away from
 
07:07:30.468 --> 07:07:30.478 align:start position:0%
having this come to your state park and
 
07:07:32.910 --> 07:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll keep that in mind and I
 
07:07:35.388 --> 07:07:35.398 align:start position:0%
hope that you will decide
 
07:07:40.548 --> 07:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
to uh make HB 177 ought to pass thank
 
07:07:41.990 --> 07:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
07:07:44.310 --> 07:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much for your
 
07:07:46.350 --> 07:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
testimony is there any questions
 
07:07:49.628 --> 07:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
representative po thank you Mr chairman
 
07:07:52.230 --> 07:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh M cas for taking my
 
07:07:52.240 --> 07:07:54.070 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh M cas for taking my
question

07:07:54.070 --> 07:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:07:57.788 --> 07:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
um by mentioning the whole um changing
 
07:08:00.990 --> 07:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
the rules Midstream concept you kind of
 
07:08:04.430 --> 07:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
um Peak my my memory or
 
07:08:07.708 --> 07:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
my if there was a policy or a
 
07:08:09.948 --> 07:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision or something
 
07:08:11.948 --> 07:08:11.958 align:start position:0%
that would prevent legislation from
 
07:08:14.468 --> 07:08:14.478 align:start position:0%
being passed if it affects current
 
07:08:16.788 --> 07:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
activities do you think that we probably
 
07:08:20.388 --> 07:08:20.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:20.398 --> 07:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

07:08:22.070 --> 07:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
07:08:25.910 --> 07:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
I I do not recall Mr Balden what you're
 
07:08:30.910 --> 07:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:35.230 --> 07:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
specific um yeah um so I believe many
 
07:08:37.910 --> 07:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
members uh who were opposed to the bill
 
07:08:41.110 --> 07:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
stated that um we were we were changing
 
07:08:45.190 --> 07:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
the rules uh during the the game um and
 
07:08:48.230 --> 07:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
I guess I was just wondering if you
 
07:08:50.708 --> 07:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
thought if there had been some kind of
 
07:08:52.948 --> 07:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
policy in the legislature that we could
 
07:08:56.190 --> 07:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
not pass any bills um that would affect
 
07:08:59.990 --> 07:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
a current activity we would probably not
 
07:09:03.270 --> 07:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
pass very much legislation would you um
 
07:09:06.070 --> 07:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
I concur with that and I would also like
 
07:09:08.388 --> 07:09:08.398 align:start position:0%
to say that some of the opposition on
 
07:09:11.910 --> 07:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
the house floor last year was because at
 
07:09:14.230 --> 07:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
that point we probably were a little too
 
07:09:16.468 --> 07:09:16.478 align:start position:0%
ambitious we included the appalation
 
07:09:19.910 --> 07:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
trail and that caused problems for Mount
 
07:09:23.030 --> 07:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
Carberry as you know we all feel that
 
07:09:26.468 --> 07:09:26.478 align:start position:0%
municipally owned uh waste districts
 
07:09:28.948 --> 07:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
should in my opinion at least be the
 
07:09:31.190 --> 07:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
future of solid waste disposal in New
 
07:09:34.628 --> 07:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not for profits and we
 
07:09:37.708 --> 07:09:37.718 align:start position:0%
this year have been very careful to make
 
07:09:41.150 --> 07:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
sure that um nothing in this very simple
 
07:09:43.190 --> 07:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan bill will affect the
 
07:09:45.628 --> 07:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
operations of Mount carbury including
 
07:09:48.788 --> 07:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:50.830 --> 07:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
expansions thank you any further
 
07:09:50.840 --> 07:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
expansions thank you any further
questions

07:09:55.590 --> 07:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:58.310 --> 07:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you so that's all I
 
07:10:01.750 --> 07:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
have my open it up and is there anyone
 
07:10:03.628 --> 07:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
else that would like to testify on this
 
07:10:06.230 --> 07:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
before I close the hearing all right so
 
07:10:16.868 --> 07:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:19.510 --> 07:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
up see the hands up holy there tons
 
07:10:33.150 --> 07:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:35.868 --> 07:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
hi yes uh sorry about that I'm pretty
 
07:10:37.510 --> 07:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
sure I signed up maybe there's a glitch
 
07:10:39.510 --> 07:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the system as we're all dealing with
 
07:10:41.990 --> 07:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
new stuff today uh my name is David
 
07:10:44.948 --> 07:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
Creer I am director of public policy for
 
07:10:46.910 --> 07:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
the business and industry Association of
 
07:10:50.030 --> 07:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh we oppose this bill uh
 
07:10:52.388 --> 07:10:52.398 align:start position:0%
for the simple reason that it follows
 
07:10:56.590 --> 07:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
basic economics um as this bill if it
 
07:10:59.190 --> 07:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
were to pass it would decrease capacity
 
07:11:02.150 --> 07:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
and then as you decrease capacity uh you
 
07:11:05.910 --> 07:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
know the uh the need uh or the supply
 
07:11:08.910 --> 07:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
will go down and then the need um or the
 
07:11:11.628 --> 07:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
demand for solid waste disposal will not
 
07:11:14.990 --> 07:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
decrease uh anytime soon for sure um and
 
07:11:17.628 --> 07:11:17.638 align:start position:0%
therefore the costs of solid waste
 
07:11:19.830 --> 07:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
disposal will increase as we need to
 
07:11:22.910 --> 07:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
find alternate sites or uh transport out
 
07:11:24.948 --> 07:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
of state uh more waste than we currently
 
07:11:27.310 --> 07:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
do uh and so this will result in
 
07:11:30.270 --> 07:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
increased costs for businesses uh in the
 
07:11:33.468 --> 07:11:33.478 align:start position:0%
state um and with that I'm happy to
 
07:11:35.310 --> 07:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony to save everyone
 
07:11:37.628 --> 07:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
some time uh and answer any questions if
 
07:11:40.270 --> 07:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you sir any uh
 
07:11:45.510 --> 07:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:47.990 --> 07:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
career not seeing any thank you for
 
07:11:50.388 --> 07:11:50.398 align:start position:0%
testifying today I'm sorry actually I
 
07:11:52.430 --> 07:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
believe uh representative s Kus was
 
07:11:54.628 --> 07:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
trying to raise her
 
07:11:58.350 --> 07:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
hand oh my apologies represent s Kus did
 
07:12:01.750 --> 07:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
you have a question yes thank you uh Mr
 
07:12:04.190 --> 07:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh Mr Creer for
 
07:12:07.670 --> 07:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is the end of
 
07:12:09.510 --> 07:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
the day and the first time we've talked
 
07:12:12.990 --> 07:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
about sending our garbage elsewhere and
 
07:12:16.150 --> 07:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
I was wondering how much of our garbage
 
07:12:18.310 --> 07:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
do we send out it seems like we're
 
07:12:20.030 --> 07:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
taking in
 
07:12:22.750 --> 07:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
more that is an excellent question and
 
07:12:25.190 --> 07:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have any answer
 
07:12:27.270 --> 07:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to disappoint you but I will
 
07:12:29.350 --> 07:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh make a note to try and find out how
 
07:12:33.030 --> 07:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
much it is um we definitely do not um
 
07:12:34.830 --> 07:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
keep all of the waste we produce we do
 
07:12:36.430 --> 07:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
export some but I'm not sure what the
 
07:12:38.070 --> 07:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
ratio is so I will look that up and I
 
07:12:41.190 --> 07:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
will get back to you thank you all right
 
07:12:45.350 --> 07:12:45.360 align:start position:0%

07:12:56.628 --> 07:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
look like we have several more hands up
 
07:12:58.388 --> 07:12:58.398 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give this hearing about
 
07:13:00.750 --> 07:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
nine more minutes and at 4:30 I have to
 
07:13:02.350 --> 07:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
close it because the committee has some
 
07:13:04.910 --> 07:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
business that needs to get done today so
 
07:13:07.430 --> 07:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask any call on and let if
 
07:13:08.548 --> 07:13:08.558 align:start position:0%

07:13:19.948 --> 07:13:19.958 align:start position:0%

Vermont and I'm the Vermont and New
 
07:13:42.190 --> 07:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community organizer with
 
07:13:44.670 --> 07:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
Community Action Works uh we work side
 
07:13:47.110 --> 07:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
by side with everyday folks to pre to
 
07:13:49.670 --> 07:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
prevent pollution and Seed Solutions
 
07:13:51.350 --> 07:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
we've worked with folks in the North
 
07:13:53.388 --> 07:13:53.398 align:start position:0%
Country for years and years and that's
 
07:13:55.750 --> 07:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
why we're here today uh simply put we're
 
07:13:58.548 --> 07:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
here in support of
 
07:14:00.990 --> 07:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
hb77 uh we know that landfills
 
07:14:02.868 --> 07:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of protection will eventually
 
07:14:05.590 --> 07:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
leak so water pollution uh they can
 
07:14:07.788 --> 07:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
spread noxious odors up to five miles
 
07:14:09.788 --> 07:14:09.798 align:start position:0%
and we just don't think it's a good idea
 
07:14:12.230 --> 07:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
to site them anywhere near uh New
 
07:14:15.110 --> 07:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state parks and then finally
 
07:14:16.750 --> 07:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
at the root of this this is a discussion
 
07:14:18.310 --> 07:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
about how much waste you're producing
 
07:14:20.070 --> 07:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
and what we're doing with that waste we
 
07:14:21.590 --> 07:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
need to get at the root of the issue
 
07:14:23.110 --> 07:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
which is that we're producing too much
 
07:14:26.150 --> 07:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
waste instead of uh pushing more
 
07:14:28.430 --> 07:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
landfills onto Rural and workingclass
 
07:14:30.910 --> 07:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
towns in the North Country so asking you
 
07:14:33.910 --> 07:14:33.920 align:start position:0%

07:16:34.708 --> 07:16:34.718 align:start position:0%

07:19:28.388 --> 07:19:28.398 align:start position:0%
here like 30 seconds I certainly can uh
 
07:19:29.990 --> 07:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
John Tut Hill from ACTH New Hampshire
 
07:19:32.750 --> 07:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County uh former member of the
 
07:19:36.510 --> 07:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
ENA committee um long ago I will submit
 
07:19:38.548 --> 07:19:38.558 align:start position:0%
written testimony uh one thing listening
 
07:19:40.030 --> 07:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
to over three and or about three and a
 
07:19:41.590 --> 07:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
half hours of testimony today is that
 
07:19:43.030 --> 07:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with very very large
 
07:19:46.388 --> 07:19:46.398 align:start position:0%
issues here long term uh going both back
 
07:19:50.070 --> 07:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
and forward it struck me today that uh
 
07:19:51.910 --> 07:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at at a situation
 
07:19:53.670 --> 07:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
where the site evaluation committee
 
07:19:56.270 --> 07:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
would probably be an appropriate venue
 
07:19:58.070 --> 07:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
or frankly the Public Utilities
 
07:20:00.670 --> 07:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
Commission we're now looking at an
 
07:20:02.110 --> 07:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
industry that basically is an
 
07:20:02.120 --> 07:20:03.788 align:start position:0%
industry that basically is an
unregulated

07:20:03.788 --> 07:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
unregulated
 
07:20:06.990 --> 07:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
Monopoly um I think we really need to
 
07:20:09.070 --> 07:20:09.080 align:start position:0%

key aspects of what the amendment does
 
07:29:44.590 --> 07:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh first of all the most important thing
 
07:29:48.350 --> 07:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
is that uh what the uh bill will do as
 
07:29:51.070 --> 07:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
amended is will provide the Department's
 
07:29:53.350 --> 07:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
need for an efficient mechanism for
 
07:29:55.110 --> 07:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with health certificates to
 
07:29:57.868 --> 07:29:57.878 align:start position:0%
track to track animal transfers for
 
07:30:00.350 --> 07:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
licensing uh for licensing of pet
 
07:30:03.990 --> 07:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
vendors uh the um main things that the
 
07:30:06.990 --> 07:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it Narrows the bill to
 
07:30:09.308 --> 07:30:09.318 align:start position:0%
deal only only with health certificates
 
07:30:12.510 --> 07:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
it eliminates fees it Ren it renames the
 
07:30:15.070 --> 07:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
health certificate to the official
 
07:30:16.750 --> 07:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
certificate of transfer which was a
 
07:30:19.628 --> 07:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
department request it modifies the
 
07:30:22.230 --> 07:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
confidentiality section to allow
 
07:30:25.468 --> 07:30:25.478 align:start position:0%
official local federal and state in
 
07:30:28.388 --> 07:30:28.398 align:start position:0%
investigations of specifically of animal
 
07:30:31.110 --> 07:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
health and pet vendor license
 
07:30:33.430 --> 07:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
investigations uh it strengthens the
 
07:30:35.468 --> 07:30:35.478 align:start position:0%
confidentiality provision to prevent
 
07:30:38.948 --> 07:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
unauthorized access and use of the data
 
07:30:42.430 --> 07:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
it adds a civil penalty uh the adds the
 
07:30:44.910 --> 07:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of a civil suit if that's
 
07:30:48.430 --> 07:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
violated it adds a full-time it position
 
07:30:50.350 --> 07:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
to the Department of agriculture markets
 
07:30:51.750 --> 07:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
and foods to
 
07:30:57.150 --> 07:30:57.160 align:start position:0%
design uh and uh manage the design put
 
07:30:59.350 --> 07:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
together and manage the
 
07:31:01.910 --> 07:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
database it adds an appropriation for
 
07:31:04.628 --> 07:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
the second year of the management costs
 
07:31:06.990 --> 07:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
it converts uh it it corrects some
 
07:31:09.230 --> 07:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
wording flaws in the bill and and the
 
07:31:12.830 --> 07:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
existing law and it removes the payback
 
07:31:15.830 --> 07:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
from to the dedicated funds uh because
 
07:31:17.030 --> 07:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
the fee that would have paid them back
 
07:31:17.040 --> 07:31:18.110 align:start position:0%
the fee that would have paid them back
is

07:31:18.110 --> 07:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:31:19.948 --> 07:31:19.958 align:start position:0%
eliminated uh
 
07:31:23.750 --> 07:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
a couple things uh that are still in the
 
07:31:26.110 --> 07:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh that it remain leaves in the original
 
07:31:28.788 --> 07:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
bill is a clarification for dealing with
 
07:31:30.990 --> 07:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
a health certificate waiver which was a
 
07:31:32.910 --> 07:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
request of the department specifically
 
07:31:39.190 --> 07:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
of the vets and uh it pays for the um uh
 
07:31:41.388 --> 07:31:41.398 align:start position:0%
design and deployment uh with excess
 
07:31:44.990 --> 07:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
money from the IP and product LIC
 
07:31:47.510 --> 07:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
funds and uh
 
07:31:50.110 --> 07:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
if anyone wants a a little more detail
 
07:31:52.430 --> 07:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
on that I can give it to them if not
 
07:31:54.590 --> 07:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
then I would be happy to start
 
07:31:57.190 --> 07:31:57.200 align:start position:0%

doit the commissioner of agriculture in
 
07:32:10.750 --> 07:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
the state vetenarian and we discussed a
 
07:32:12.190 --> 07:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
lot of the changes that we were making
 
07:32:14.670 --> 07:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
and many of these changes were at the he
 
07:32:17.350 --> 07:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
of them and their agencies in order to
 
07:32:20.150 --> 07:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
comply with the areas work on on one of
 
07:32:21.590 --> 07:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
the things that's in this bill as
 
07:32:23.788 --> 07:32:23.798 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby discussed is a
 
07:32:27.388 --> 07:32:27.398 align:start position:0%
full-time it position and one of the
 
07:32:28.510 --> 07:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
things that will occur with that
 
07:32:30.750 --> 07:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
full-time it position and I'm trying to
 
07:32:32.468 --> 07:32:32.478 align:start position:0%

representative Bix correct me if I'm
 
07:32:35.510 --> 07:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
wrong but I believe the department back
 
07:32:39.468 --> 07:32:39.478 align:start position:0%
currently has 12th of one person's time
 
07:32:41.430 --> 07:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated to support its
 
07:32:45.708 --> 07:32:45.718 align:start position:0%
it uh needs and this full-time position
 
07:32:47.750 --> 07:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
would not only support the it needs of
 
07:32:50.350 --> 07:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
of the database but the other needs that
 
07:32:51.990 --> 07:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
are within the department that are
 
07:32:54.670 --> 07:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
currently not being met right and that
 
07:32:57.468 --> 07:32:57.478 align:start position:0%
is cor the 12th is correct and the
 
07:32:59.430 --> 07:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner of it said that that would
 
07:33:02.350 --> 07:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
probably decrease because of uh new
 
07:33:04.548 --> 07:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
demands on their
 
07:33:07.388 --> 07:33:07.398 align:start position:0%
time all right any other discussion from
 
07:33:10.590 --> 07:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
committee members uh yes I I uh Sher
 
07:33:13.628 --> 07:33:13.638 align:start position:0%
Duty I just had one question um so if
 
07:33:17.830 --> 07:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
they if we include the IT person um does
 
07:33:19.670 --> 07:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
that take care care of the
 
07:33:22.308 --> 07:33:22.318 align:start position:0%
commissioner's concerns about uh the
 
07:33:25.430 --> 07:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing funding of the database because
 
07:33:27.270 --> 07:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
I know that that was a concern of his
 
07:33:30.590 --> 07:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm assuming that the ongoing
 
07:33:33.590 --> 07:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
funding issue you know relates to having
 
07:33:36.468 --> 07:33:36.478 align:start position:0%
an IT person so do you understand what
 
07:33:40.590 --> 07:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
I'm saying uh I the the ongoing funding
 
07:33:44.548 --> 07:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
is something that um has more to do with
 
07:33:47.548 --> 07:33:47.558 align:start position:0%
uh how the money gets into the system uh
 
07:33:51.230 --> 07:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
the um for initially that it person I
 
07:33:54.548 --> 07:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
believe would be paid for out of the uh
 
07:33:58.230 --> 07:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
funds Set uh uh that are being used to
 
07:34:01.388 --> 07:34:01.398 align:start position:0%
establish it uh and
 
07:34:04.510 --> 07:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh and having an IT person who really
 
07:34:05.990 --> 07:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
knows what's going on and is working
 
07:34:08.388 --> 07:34:08.398 align:start position:0%
with the Department should help them get
 
07:34:10.388 --> 07:34:10.398 align:start position:0%
a cheaper contract than they might
 
07:34:15.150 --> 07:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise get uh but in terms of the
 
07:34:18.868 --> 07:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
funding uh into future um future terms
 
07:34:23.070 --> 07:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
of legislature that will depend on the
 
07:34:24.830 --> 07:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
um continuing
 
07:34:27.270 --> 07:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh
 
07:34:30.788 --> 07:34:30.798 align:start position:0%
which in most departments have their
 
07:34:33.150 --> 07:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
staff funded by General funding
 
07:34:35.070 --> 07:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for a lot of their works
 
07:34:36.708 --> 07:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
so that I think that's that's something
 
07:34:39.308 --> 07:34:39.318 align:start position:0%
that is reasonable to expect because
 
07:34:42.190 --> 07:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
this is for work that is required of
 
07:34:44.708 --> 07:34:44.718 align:start position:0%
them by the state which they currently
 
07:34:48.230 --> 07:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to to do and
 
07:34:51.308 --> 07:34:51.318 align:start position:0%
and I'll add or to that representa is
 
07:34:53.910 --> 07:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
what one of the advantages well I guess
 
07:34:55.388 --> 07:34:55.398 align:start position:0%
maybe not an advantage one of the things
 
07:34:57.110 --> 07:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
that was sought after in this bill by
 
07:34:58.910 --> 07:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
removing the fees and going to an
 
07:35:01.590 --> 07:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation general fund appropriation
 
07:35:04.670 --> 07:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
is back in 2018 when uh the legislature
 
07:35:07.430 --> 07:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
decided to make this mandate that the
 
07:35:08.868 --> 07:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
department do this and make it part of
 
07:35:12.270 --> 07:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
their job they didn't bother to fund and
 
07:35:14.548 --> 07:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that it was fair to put the
 
07:35:18.510 --> 07:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
cost of funding that onto the the animal
 
07:35:20.190 --> 07:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
owners of New Hampshire and especially
 
07:35:22.590 --> 07:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
the readers and those who are who are
 
07:35:25.190 --> 07:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
seeking these Health certificates and it
 
07:35:27.308 --> 07:35:27.318 align:start position:0%
was certainly my strong opinion and I
 
07:35:28.830 --> 07:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
know it's shared by many others that if
 
07:35:31.590 --> 07:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature wants this uh task to be
 
07:35:33.150 --> 07:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
performed then the legislature needs to
 
07:35:36.350 --> 07:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:39.628 --> 07:35:39.638 align:start position:0%
it thank you welcome any other
 
07:35:42.070 --> 07:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
conversation thoughts comments or we all
 
07:35:46.270 --> 07:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:49.230 --> 07:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
vote Mr chair I still have some issues
 
07:35:51.830 --> 07:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
on that page three about the public
 
07:35:55.548 --> 07:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
being able to uh Source at the source
 
07:35:58.270 --> 07:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
information on the uh Health
 
07:36:01.070 --> 07:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
certificates um we we be able to discuss
 
07:36:02.590 --> 07:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
that at a later time when it comes back
 
07:36:05.070 --> 07:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
out of Appropriations we certainly would
 
07:36:06.230 --> 07:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mason you
 
07:36:08.230 --> 07:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
raised a point in a private conversation
 
07:36:11.590 --> 07:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
between you and I and uh I had directed
 
07:36:12.750 --> 07:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative Mason to have a
 
07:36:14.510 --> 07:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
conversation with Dr Crawford and there
 
07:36:16.308 --> 07:36:16.318 align:start position:0%
may be a slight verbage change that
 
07:36:18.548 --> 07:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
needs to occur there for a point that
 
07:36:19.910 --> 07:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
represent resentative Mason brought up
 
07:36:21.628 --> 07:36:21.638 align:start position:0%
and that is certainly something that we
 
07:36:25.430 --> 07:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
could um uh adjust in language when it
 
07:36:27.350 --> 07:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
is over in finance being looked that I I
 
07:36:31.708 --> 07:36:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:36.990 --> 07:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:40.708 --> 07:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
discussion all right so we have a motion
 
07:36:45.548 --> 07:36:45.558 align:start position:0%

any further discussion before we go to a
vote

07:38:31.948 --> 07:38:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:35.388 --> 07:38:35.398 align:start position:0%
representative um Mr chair we're having
 
07:38:39.468 --> 07:38:39.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:43.590 --> 07:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
again you hear me now yes
 
07:38:46.548 --> 07:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:38:50.868 --> 07:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
sorry um so so we just added an IT
 
07:38:54.750 --> 07:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
person um into this an IT position on
 
07:38:56.430 --> 07:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
top of the original
 
07:39:01.230 --> 07:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:03.868 --> 07:39:03.878 align:start position:0%
commission eventually that will occur
 
07:39:05.830 --> 07:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
again the IT person will be funded
 
07:39:09.270 --> 07:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
because of the startup cost of initially
 
07:39:10.708 --> 07:39:10.718 align:start position:0%
they will be funded out of the startup
 
07:39:12.110 --> 07:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
cost and if they are maintained then
 
07:39:13.150 --> 07:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
they would have to be a different
 
07:39:16.868 --> 07:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:19.708 --> 07:39:19.718 align:start position:0%
correct so I just to give you a little
 
07:39:23.308 --> 07:39:23.318 align:start position:0%
background I reached out to U uh Dave
 
07:39:26.990 --> 07:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
alonis who is uh head of the OS and
 
07:39:28.868 --> 07:39:28.878 align:start position:0%
asked him about the process of updating
 
07:39:30.830 --> 07:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note because we've made
 
07:39:33.270 --> 07:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
significant changes to this bill we've
 
07:39:35.190 --> 07:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
gone from a fee structure to
 
07:39:37.190 --> 07:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation I was informed that we're
 
07:39:39.190 --> 07:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
not able to get an updated fiscal note
 
07:39:41.388 --> 07:39:41.398 align:start position:0%
until after the house passes the bill on
 
07:39:45.030 --> 07:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
the floor so if we pass this as a
 
07:39:46.708 --> 07:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
committee and it goes to the house floor
 
07:39:48.308 --> 07:39:48.318 align:start position:0%
and then passes before it goes to the
 
07:39:50.030 --> 07:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
SEC committee then they will do an
 
07:39:52.468 --> 07:39:52.478 align:start position:0%
updated fiscal but we're not able to do
 
07:39:56.468 --> 07:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:03.270 --> 07:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:05.230 --> 07:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
discussion all right seeing none I'm
 
07:40:07.430 --> 07:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
going to ask the uh clerk to call the
 
07:40:10.910 --> 07:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
role on an otpa on House Bill 532 with
 
07:40:10.920 --> 07:40:12.150 align:start position:0%
role on an otpa on House Bill 532 with
Amendment

07:40:12.150 --> 07:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
