entire state which is how it came to be
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.269 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
specific uh policy changes at peas do
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
you think would result by the board um
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
appointees being appointed by the
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
governor as opposed to local thank you
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
communities I appreciate the question
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
and there'll be there'll be others to
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
speak to this but um the the the way the
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
membership is is uh at this point in
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
time uh there has been a history
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
let let me start by saying this is a
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
state facility not just a just not one
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
town it has everything to do with the
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
economic uh prosperity of the state but
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a town um was um was
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
leaning on representation from their
 
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
town to think first for their town as
 
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to what's best for the authority
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
and best for the state and it's my
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that they're trying to um
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
while localities should be involved in
 
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
while localities should be involved in
the

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
conversation but they should be part of
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
a of the higher uh cause which is a uh
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
which is the economic uh development of
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
the entire State and there's there have
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
been issues to my understanding to the
 
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.470 align:start position:0%
been issues to my understanding to the
other

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%

Hampshire that local
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
control is very important to us we

premise and this is one of those
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities to live up to that
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
premise and keep that Spirit of
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%

chair of the peas Development Authority
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
folks decide to make up our membership
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh but I will give you my personal
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
opinion and tell you about the issue
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve first in answer to
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
the question what do we decide we
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
actually decide on every contract every
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
proposal for development at peas every
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
proposal for use of our ports and
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
harbors which are pretty
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
extensive uh and it's a big job um I was
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
the governor's appointment when I was
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
asked to serve I said why me I'm from
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
conquer I don't go to Portsmouth I don't
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
do any business I don't know the players
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
I never go out on the ocean I don't even
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
eat much seafood and uh I don't even
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
know the players he said perfect you're
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
just what we want um here's the so we
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
decide um we have everything from people
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
who want to expand businesses over there
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
sigu for example is in the middle and we
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
lease space to them uh to whether we're
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
going to allow cruise ships to come into
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
the port that's being rebuilt in
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth it's a very wide
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
ranging organization it was the first
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
base closed in this country under bra
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
you remember when P closed it has I
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
would argue been the single most success
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
ESS F Redevelopment of a port in the
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
country or base it works very well here
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
are a few overlying facts we don't
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
actually Own It We Own It subject to an
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
FAA Grant to us when the defense
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
department gave up the property they of
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
course have a recall provision if we
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
were in a war and they needed to take
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
over the entire property they
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
could then it went to the FAA the FAA
 
00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
then granted it and deed it if you will
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
to the p Development Authority subject
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
to the right that we or subject to the
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we have to follow
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
all of their mandates so we get a number
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
of mandates that we don't have any
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
choice in we also have gotten a lot of
 
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
federal money that also uh impacts us so
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
every time we think we want to do
 
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
something it's a very laborious process
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
for example I suggested why why don't we
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
have a private operator or let the
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
National Guard run the airport why now
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
that it's developed sort of we have a
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
few Lots left why have us and the FAA
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
came up from Boston and said you can't
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
do that you must continue to run it I
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
said well what if we decided we don't
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
want to uh they immediate response was
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
every Community that's in the area would
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
lose its eligibility for any Federal
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
grant of any kind which was kind of
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
threatening so we have a lot of
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
strictures on us here is the issue that
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve and I would
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
recommend you kill this bill I have
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
great friends the mayor of Portsmouth
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
was calling me and saying we want to
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
have our local control and there's a
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
makeup the governor appoints somebody
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
the speaker appoints somebody the towns
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
have a representative the uh county has
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
a representative it's a great group they
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
work hard uh people change in and
 
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:15.799 align:start position:0%
out I would recommend you kill the bill
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you the problem we're
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
trying to solve if you look at the
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it says every vote
 
00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:24.029 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it says every vote
we

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.039 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
take every member has to consider three

things the impact on the surrounding
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
communities the impact on the region or
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%

coldbrook Handover North Conway
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
Kean there are a couple issues that come
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
up from time to time whether it's Air
 
00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
where not with bad
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
intentions perhaps not understanding
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we're a body itic which is subject
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
to exercising our fiduciary duty where
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
the local appointed representatives were
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
directed by the municipal governing
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
Authority on how they were to vote on an
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
issue and that was brought to the
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
board's attention saying I have a letter
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
from my governing Authority that tells
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
me that notwithstanding my obligation to
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
consider the impact on the area or not
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
withstanding my obligation to consider
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
the benefit or impact to the state I
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
cannot consider those I must do as I
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
have been directed that is directly
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
incompatible with the enabling
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
legislation and with our responsibility
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
in fact we showed it to our legal
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
councel who reviewed it and reviewed it
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general saying that's
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
not permissible it's not if the governor
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
sent me a letter telling me how to vote
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
on an issue I would resign because they
 
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
do not have that Authority it runs
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
contrary to the whole establishment of
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
the authority there are some issues that
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
get very emotional particularly for the
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
most affected communities how many
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
flights a day and who's going to how
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
many trucks you know we have a lot of
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
users go right through Greenland for
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
example noise over Ry there are lots of
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
issues and there's no question the most
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
adjacent communities are the most
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
affected but when you tell a member they
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
must vote a certain way that puts not
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
only that member in a bad position it
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
prevents The Authority from doing what
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
the statute says we are to do which is
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
to consider all three so I think there's
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
a simple solution simpler solution to
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
this it's important for the communities
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
that get appointing authority to make
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
that that appointment but I think if we
 
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
if you decide to get rid of this bill
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
which I would recommend that we come
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
back with another bill that simply makes
 
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.870 align:start position:0%
back with another bill that simply makes
it

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
clear that no appointing authority
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's the governor it's the town
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
of Newington it's the Str stord County
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
appointee shall direct any member on how
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
to vote because it's directly contrary
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
to how we do things in New Hampshire and
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
it also would be an abdication of their
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility under the statute and I
 
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
also think if you look at the appointing
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
authority how you can be removed I
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
actually serve at the pleasure of the
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
governor um but most of the appointments
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
say you can be removed for cause we need
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
to make it very clear that just because
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
a representative appointed from straford
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
County or from Portsmith or from one of
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
the communities doesn't vote the way the
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
governing body the selectman of the city
 
00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:41.519 align:start position:0%
council would like them to that absent
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
bad faith or absent gross negligence
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
that's not cause because we need people
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
to exercise their independent judgment
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
you know I get the question all the time
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
what good is peas doing for Kean what
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
Good's PE doing for North Conway
 
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
what good is pe's doing for wrench and I
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
know let's be honest the burden falls on
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
the local communities but so has an
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
enormous benefit it has been a true
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
economic engine so that's everything I
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
know I I would recommend you kill this
 
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:15.799 align:start position:0%
bill it will preserve the right of the
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
communities to make their appointments
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that the sponsors or someone else
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
come back with a new bill that simply
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
strengthens the duties that says no
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
appointing authority whether it's the
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
governor the Speaker of the House house
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
the town of Newington Portsmouth shall
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
direct their member how to vote and
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
voting contrary to that Town's or
 
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:37.519 align:start position:0%
appointing Authority's wishes is not
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
good cause just cause for removable
 
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
absent bad fith we cannot be in a
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
position where we have members come in
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
who say I feel constrained not to
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
consider the impact on the county or on
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
the state because I've been directed by
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
my governing Authority whether that's
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
the governor telling me what what to do
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
or town selectman or the city council
 
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to answer any
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
questions any any questions by members
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
har thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question you um this is a
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
board of directors do you have bylaws
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes we do have a followup a followup
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
could you not make that same statement
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
in the bylaws that you'd want us to pass
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
a bill to say have you looked into that
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
um we definely could have and our bylaws
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
talk about our fiduciary duty to abody
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
politic but when an appointing authority
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
tells a member you shall vote that way
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
they obviously feel constrained and I
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
think we just want to make
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
sure that whoever anybody who has the
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
authority to appoint somebody doesn't
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
also think they also have the authority
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
to tell them how to vote good thank
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
you any other questions by members of
 
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.590 align:start position:0%
you any other questions by members of
the

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
committee representative of Derby thank
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned um uh including
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
remove for cause um and one of the um
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
one of the positions of the seven does
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
have removed for cause are you are you
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting all of them including the
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
three appointed by you know there's one
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
by the governor one by the by the
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and so on all of
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
them should that would be fine okay uh
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
right now it's only straford County and
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
the municipal appointed if there were
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
some definition cause can't be I
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
disagree with how you voted
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
cause should be you know negligence
 
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
gross negligence abdication of Duty not
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
showing up for the meetings you know uh
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
but we what we're trying to do is make
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
sure that every decision we make
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
considers all three of what you told us
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
we had to consider benefit and impact on
 
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities benefit and
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
impact on region and let's not forget
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
state representative donelly thank you
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
question um in the in the past ear year
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
has there been any
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh vote that actually uh said look we
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
don't want the following thing and it
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
did impact the state I'm trying to
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
understand the well I'll give you an
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
example there was for a brief time a
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
proposal for Air Cargo now keep in mind
 
00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
that the last time I went to peas we
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
were flying strategic bombers with
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
nuclear tipped weapons on them so I
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
think anything's an improvement over
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
that but um uh Air Cargo would have a
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
significant impact on those in the
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
flight path okay uh there are benefits
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
to the state for Air Cargo tremendous
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
benefits uh there benefits to the
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
airport in terms of fees because we
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
spend a 100% of our funds that we make
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
from the golf course and rent to keep up
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
the airport I keep going why don't we
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
take that money and do something else
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
with it we're not allowed to by the FAA
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
in fact we can't take the profits we
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
make at the airport and use them to help
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the ports I mean that's how strict the
 
00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
restrictions are on us so uh a good
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
example uh that proposal died uh I think
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
a majority of the board didn't think Air
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
Cargo is appropriate at peas for a
 
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
number of reasons but that's a great
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
case where Air Cargo could be a benefit
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
to the state but a detriment to some
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
degree to the impacted communities if
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
you tell a member they may not consider
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
the benefit to the state you're
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
basically taking away or trying to limit
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
them from exercising there for Deary
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
Duty which we just want to make sure we
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
make we're happy to hear from everybody
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
I think we have a very good track record
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
I've only been on this board for a
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
couple years of listening to everybody
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
on every issue and inviting people in to
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
talk to the staff with professionals and
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
not hiding any disagreements or disputes
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
and just trying to do the best job we
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
can that's fairest to everybody and
 
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.430 align:start position:0%
can that's fairest to everybody and
there's

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
always except when we approve a road
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
race use of the roads inside everybody's
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
always unhappy about some decision we
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
make but that Air Cargo would be a good
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
example um you know for a while there
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
was a debate over how many free based
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
operators I'll give a good example FBO
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
is a freebased operator we've had one
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
there uh Port City air for many years
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
they took over from PanAm there was a
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
proposal by another group millionaire to
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
do one I think that's sort of gone away
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
but the FAA I said well why don't we
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
avoid this dispute and just say we only
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
want one FBO that's
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
illegal if 10 freebased operators come
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
in and meet the requirements we have to
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
let 10 in even though we think that's a
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
terrible idea personally I think it' be
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
a terrible idea but we have so many
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
strictures placed on us by the
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
FAA by the Department of Defense that it
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
really does limit some of our
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
discretion so I'm trying to make your
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
life easy you should tell everybody
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
who's here worried that we want to take
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
away that we don't leave that a point in
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
Authority let's work on how we make it
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
clear that no appointing authority shall
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
vote representative love it for question
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:17.389 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
my

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
question if you were to put the Hat on
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
the representatives the representatives
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
from the local communities what do you
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
think that they're major or over the
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
years over the the past couple of years
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
their most significant concerns have
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
been um well with the cargo air
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
particularly everybody was going to be
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
at the South End of the runway they
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be in a noise pattern
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's very legitimate different from
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
the state's concern which would in hear
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
it on this big fight where lobbyists got
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars so I'm glad they're
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
thriving to lobby for against the FBO
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
that was applying it was environmental
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
concerns and those are I think still
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
working their way through the court even
 
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
though the original right of Entry is
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
what we call permission to start to
 
00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
investigate a site has expired but we
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
know there are going to be more FBO
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
applications so um I think those have
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
been the two sort of hottest issues uh
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
frankly there have been issues
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
surrounding Sig hour uh which needs to
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
expand because of that large government
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
contract um we've had issues in the past
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
interestingly all the people who have
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
Office Buildings or any building over
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
there they don't own that why don't they
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
own it because they lease it why do we
 
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
not let them own it because the FAA
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
won't because the FAA has a right to
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
take every piece of that land back so we
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
give them long-term leases uh but we do
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
not have the right to actually sell a
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
piece of property per se a lot of people
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
that or
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
followup thank you can you just really
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
quickly give me a an update on how the
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities around peas are
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
have addressed or are dealing with the p
 
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
issue um that's a great
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
question remember we we're we're limited
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
amount of time I'm trying to help you to
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
kill the bill here folks so everybody
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
can go home so here's
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
the you're talking to a guy who took his
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
last science course as a senior in high
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
school I'm a liberal arts history kind
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
of guy but here's the problem there's P
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
everywhere over there
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
um anytime there is a project it's a
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
concern um under the transfer from the
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
Air Force to the FAA to us somebody with
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
great foresight and I think it was
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
somebody in Governor Greg's office
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
because this happened on his watch
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
trying to imagine the Future made it
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
very clear that the Air Force owns that
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
liability so one of the things we have
 
00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0%
to be very very careful with is not
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
doing anything that would allow the
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
United States Air Force to say you've
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
assumed that
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
liability um and I'll give you an
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
example of that we have a development
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
that would require removal of a
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
discontinued fuel line that the Air
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
Force had and to give permission to do
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
that to the private entity that's going
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
to build a building there they wanted
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
the Air Force wanted this private
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
developer who would never have deep
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
enough Pockets to solve the Pas issue to
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
assume liability and we wouldn't let
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
that happen we said that's a deal killer
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
we have to do it so ultimately what I
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
believe is going to happen is the United
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
States Air Force is going to be the
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
primary party responsible for cleaning
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
that up nationally again from the
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
briefings we've gotten on a pentagon
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
level they have this problem not only at
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
peas but lots of places
 
00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
and they've been in my opinion this is
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
just me this is not the official
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
position of the peace Development
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
Authority they have been kicking the can
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
down the road and avoiding the issue and
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank goodness we have Portsmouth and
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
Newington and Ry and Greenland and
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
straford County and the state of New
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pushing hard on this issue
 
00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
because it has to be addressed it is
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
their liability they are going to have
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
to address it and these communities and
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
P are pushing for a solution But
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to be the Air Force
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
it's going to be we don't know whether
 
00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
it's a $300 million cleanup or a billion
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
doll cleanup at this point but we just
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
know it's a horrific problem and we're
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
being very careful to make sure the
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire does not assume a
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:47.800 align:start position:0%

representing the board of Selectmen you
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
all have uh at your desk a letter from
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
the board they are in opposition to this
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
bill to briefly speak to a few things
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
that have come up specifically
 
00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
representative litz comments or
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
questions regarding past the town of
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
Newington is very concerned about the
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
past contamination that came from the
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
peas Development Authority uh area that
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
was due to firefighting foam being
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
released by the
 
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
USAF and we are now experiencing it in
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
our wells all over
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
town so in that regard there's a serious
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
concern about what happens and what is
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to be developed right over the
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
the aquifers that service the town of
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
Newington in addition I'll just say that
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
um three of the seven votes on this
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
Authority are for Portsmouth Newington
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Greenland just three of them so the
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
majority still stands with the governor
 
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
majority still stands with the governor
and

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
counsel and
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
also um different than many other State
 
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
Properties the town and cities provide
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
police fire and Public Works Services
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
the Newington Police Department uh is in
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
charge of the the policing of the
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
Newington half of the PDA Portsmouth
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
their half Public Works and fire as well
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%

much

00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:25.390 align:start position:0%
much
John

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you uh quick
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
reference to the past there is no
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
solution that anyone's really aware of
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
at this point so it's in our wells it's
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
in our water the US Air Force monitors
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
it for us lets us know when it's at a
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous level then if at that point
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
you change your water system you go to
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
town city water or you put filters on so
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
there's no solution that we're aware of
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
yet uh I commend Mr dpri for agreeing
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
that this is a build that should be
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
killed uh it really rests local control
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
and REM moves it to the state so again
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to see that he's in favor
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
of it I would point out that there's a
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
long history of the peace Development
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
Authority being very successful it
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
really is this he says an economic
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
engine for the region I think with
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
reference to the individual cases he
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned those are very recent and I
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
would look at those in the history of
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
the PDA there have been so many projects
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
that have come before the PDA that
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
everyone has approved it's only these
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
last couple projects the F ba fixed Base
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
operator um and the other one that the
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
towns in the area have objected to so I
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
think that's reasonable and then the
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
other one was the flights going over the
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
other end of the airport I think you're
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
going to expect a reasonable amount of
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
of objections from local communities
 
00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559 align:start position:0%
they really impact them
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
significantly I would agree that there
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
should be something in the documents as
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
you said Mr Arby that points out as Mr
 
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
Bri said as well that the towns have no
 
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:47.559 align:start position:0%
mandate in terms of how their
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
individuals vote but to your point Mr
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
Derby it should be that all members of
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
the PDA can be removed for M feance or
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
something as opposed to just a strap of
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
rep so very good point that you pick
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
though again I thank you for looking at
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
this bill I agree with the pr it should
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
you is there any questions for members
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the of the uh the
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.430 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
much

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.790 align:start position:0%
much
and

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.109 align:start position:0%
 
Emily

00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:27.790 align:start position:0%
 
selli

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
selli
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes in a name like Ren Zulu I should
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
have been able to read that good morning
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
I am uh here to speak in opposition of
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
this bill I have lived in New inton now
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
for 10 years and am pretty involved in
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
local politics there um New Hampshire
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
Prides itself on empowering local
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
citizens to be involved with its
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
government um as uh Dennis Malloy had
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
pointed out I think that is a
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of our
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh State um on the way in I was
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
commenting I you know I remember coming
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
here in fourth grade right um and and I
 
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
think that that speaks volumes in terms
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
of um having empowering citizens to be
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
involved um this bill as proposed does
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
the opposite by allowing the governor
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
who whoever that may be and the
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
executive Council to determine who
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
represents our citizens at the peas
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
development Authority the PDA has been a
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
successful board and has created a great
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
Economic and Business Hub and therefore
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
I would ask the committee to oppose this
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any questions by members
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
of the committee seeing none thank you
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
all of the pink cards and no one else
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify I will close the hear
 
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me I did put a card up
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
goodan oh I'm sorry I'm
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
sorry how did I get somehow got into a
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
apologies morning thank you Mr chairman
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I actually
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
like to thank uh chairman duri for being
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
here as well and speaking I think uh he
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
shed a lot of light on where uh his
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
feelings on this and I'm here to speak
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh in agreement with him that I think
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
this bill as it stands uh should be
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
killed and um sounds like there's
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
probably definitely room for the PDA and
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
our local communities to all come
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
together maybe enhance our communication
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit um in any any different
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
facets but uh again my name is Brian
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
srini I'm a resident of Newington I'm
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
here to uh speak in opposition to that
 
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.670 align:start position:0%
here to uh speak in opposition to that
business

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
as a lifelong resin of the SE Coast I've
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
seen firsthand the evolution of peas
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
from a Strategic Air Command base into
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
the thriving business and Commercial uh
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
development that it is today uh in fact
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
like many in the area and throughout the
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
state I believe what's taken place at
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
P's now International Trade Port uh over
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
the past 30 plus years is a true success
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
story in Economic Development none of
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
that success happened by accident for
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
sure and it came about through through a
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
lot of hard work by many people over the
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
years um but and uh much of which was
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
led and guided by the PDA and the
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
various board members in that time and
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
again over the years a big credit um and
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
a big reason why is the composition of
 
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
that board and um I think that that's
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
integral to have state government
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
involvement the governor and the council
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
house Speaker Senate President but just
 
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
as importantly some local community
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
input as those communities are are
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
directly affected but I also appreciate
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
what chairman duy said that the PDA is
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
does not work for the the seast it's
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
truly a state organization entity and I
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
do appreciate that but this is how it
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
was set up 30 years ago I think the
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
results of um PS and the PDA speak for
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
itself in those 30 years um and again I
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
just would uh like to thank you for your
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
time and and encourage you to uh
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%

I'm not a good typist as
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
so it is such the intent of the
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is to give the Department of
 
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:37.720 align:start position:0%

regulate The Cutting of native aquatic
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
vegetation in New Hampshire's Lakes up
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
until a short time ago it was assumed
 
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
that Dees had that Authority Under The
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
Dredge and Phil statutes chapter
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
482a now Dees is concerned that the
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
present Dron Phil statute may not
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
be may not have that Authority Under the
 
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
present uh pres regen Phil
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
statute uh since they're concerned
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
they that this the statute does not may
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
not give them that Authority why not
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
give them why not we give them that
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
Authority immediately
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
as or immediately as possible uh in a in
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
482a

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
482a
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that I have much else
 
00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
to say on that I think other than
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
that uh we should do these things this
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
as quickly I feel they should do this as
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible to have
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
that their ability to regulate the the
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh The Cutting of native
 
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
vegetation in uh in the our
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
Lakes should not go be lost we it's
 
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
there's a clear and present danger I
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
think on that in that respect so
 
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.230 align:start position:0%
think on that in that respect so
uh

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's all I have to say I think
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
weren't included in this amendment well
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
invasive species are already already
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
included in a another section of the law
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%

Darby thank you Mr chair thank you for

taking my
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
question um the the bill that you're
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
amending is is a you know well supported
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill um I I believe that the we heard
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
that department of environmental service
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
is you know thinks this is an important
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
bill sometimes um non- gerine amendments
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
can act as poison pills when they get on
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall are you you
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
have any concerns about
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
that not in
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
well not in this not in this case I
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
think this uh I I uh I think that the uh
 
00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
it can be a a poison pill this is not a
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
poison pill believe me this is uh this
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
is something something that uh uh that I
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
really will think is important from a
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
point of view of uh leaving the V
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
leaving we leaving the Lakes the lakes
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
are vulnerable now in this in this
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
instance if uh people who
 
00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:20.839 align:start position:0%
are uh people the people who are who are
 
00:54:20.839 --> 00:54:21.630 align:start position:0%
are uh people the people who are who are
there

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
to to protect the lakes and they're the
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
experts if they're not if if they're not
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
at least monitoring what's
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
happening uh we we are the the likees
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
danger any other followup thank you Mr
 
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank thank you
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
again um so I I I very much appreciate
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and I spent a lot of time
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
reading uh researching based on your
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I can't find in um section 487
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
RSA 487
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
where it talks about um cut cutting
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
aquatic vegetation it does talk a lot
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
about studies it talks about um grants
 
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
to control them but it doesn't
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
specifically talk about cutting so then
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
I went to the um the dees rules and I
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't find any rules either about um
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
cutting aquatic vegetation and we know
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
um I know because I've you know as a as
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
a lak fromont property owner that
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
cutting mil foil is about the worst
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
thing you can do because it spreads it
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
and so I'm very concerned that if we
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
don't also allow rule making around
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
cutting all vegetation native and
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
invasive then we're leaving a whole do
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
you have any comments on that rule
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
making does exist uh I've handed out a
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh a packet and in there is the
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
chapter least and I pled this out by the
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
way yeah
 
00:56:01.029 --> 00:56:01.039 align:start position:0%
yesterday so it's no uh no I didn't send
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
it out no I didn't send it out I printed
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
it so it's uh if you look at the chapter
 
00:56:07.039 --> 00:56:08.309 align:start position:0%
it so it's uh if you look at the chapter
uh

00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
wt500 and you'll see in the very be very
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
beginning on the first page you'll see a
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
line just go go through that's okay
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see a line there where it says
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh this there's mentions the including
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
aquatic vegetation control water access
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
structure you know it's appr Pro is
 
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.150 align:start position:0%
structure you know it's appr Pro is
let's

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
let's
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
see discusses project criteria approval
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
482a might be needed including aquatic
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
vegetation control that's on page one
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh on I'm just finding areas where they
 
00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:02.549 align:start position:0%
uh on I'm just finding areas where they
talk

00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
talk
 
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
about Native
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
vegitation uh and we go to on page
 
00:57:11.789 --> 00:57:11.799 align:start position:0%
three uh where it's talk
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
about uh part EnV WT 510 aquatic
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak uh my name is
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
Christine Kamal I own a home on uh 59
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
Southshore Drive in pelum New Hampshire
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
on Little Island Pond I also served on
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
our local Conservation
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
Commission um I'm in favor of this bill
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh to um uh 15 um excuse me
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
1554 with amendment to permit um or give
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
authority to the Department of
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to regulate The
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
Cutting of native aquatic
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
vegetation um and the reason being is
 
00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
native aquatic vegetation plays a vital
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
role in our Lake ecology it actually
 
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
helps to keep the water clear and it
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
also uh keeps um a healthy aquatic
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
ecosystem uh we've got nutrients coming
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
into our lakes and ponds uh these um The
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
Aquatic vegetation and CYO bacteria need
 
01:00:05.029 --> 01:00:05.039 align:start position:0%
these nutrients to grow and proliferate
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
when you cut native aquatic vegetation
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
that and you remove it from the water
 
01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.589 align:start position:0%
that and you remove it from the water
water

01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
body the cob bacteria gets all the
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
nutrients there's no
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
competition and with that said I'd like
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
to share with you a very compelling
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
story uh what happens when unregulated
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
cutting is allowed to happen on our
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
lakes in 2022 Our Lake Association
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
decided to cut the Troublesome uh uh
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
weeds um they started cutting native
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
aquatic vegetation with hand rakes
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
despite uh several experts who advise
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
them not to take a heavy-handed
 
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
approach um a conservative estimate was
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
1.2 million square
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
feet was cut and removed from the lake
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
and uh the statutes um that um uh
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
rep um Rula was referring to uh a major
 
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
project is considered one greater than
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
10,000 square feet so uh 1.2 million
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
V uh the next year 2023 uh last summer
 
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
they purchased what's called a Water
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
Gator and in that packet I provided
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
images uh the last page shows the Water
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
Gator it's the size of like a little
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
Fiat um it has uh it's Opera remote
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
control there's a chaser boat that
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
follows it uh it has blades that are
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
adjustable they said that this machine
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
could cut in a half hour what it took
 
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
three days to do with handres and if you
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
look very carefully you can see that um
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
one of the downsides is that this uh
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
aquatic machine fails to pick up all the
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
cut vegetation you can see it in the
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
image floating all
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
around um these cuting can also
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
reestablish themselves by Falling to the
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
bottom not just by seed uh case in point
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
to drive home how much vegetation was
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
being cut one day a few friends went out
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
and uh we just taken a leisurely paddle
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
board and it was the day following the
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
Harvester when it had gone out uh we got
 
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
to the west side of the lake and uh it
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
was filled with floating cut vegetation
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
everywhere uh we knew this wasn't good
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we proceeded to pick it up with our
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
hands and pile it up on our boards and
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh there was three of us out there and
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
within less than two hours we had must
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
have picked up a dozen piles like the
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
size you see on those boards that was
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
not from boat activity that was left
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
over from that aquatic Harvester and let
 
01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:41.799 align:start position:0%
me remind you you don't need a permit
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
you don't need a license you don't have
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
to be a limnologist or a biologist you
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
don't even have to have knowledge of an
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
aquatic ecosystem to operate one of
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
these things and uh so with that said
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
bring us to August 2023 Last Summer sum
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
we had an unprecedented 71 days with CYO
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
bacteria advisories starting in August
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
we started seeing cob bacteria blooms
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
and they continued till um November 8th
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
was the last day and in one of the
 
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
photos there you're going to see this
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
image of this bright green Soo Bloom
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
that was posted on our Lake Facebook
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
page comment started coming in oh my
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
gosh I've never seen anything like this
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
in all my years living on the pond oh my
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
gosh what's causing this um there was a
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
lot of concern raised
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh and then lastly and I would like to
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
mention that the Department of
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services recognizes the
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
value of native aquatic vegetation uh
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
I've also included that in the letter
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's in your
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
packet um uh they have an article a fact
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
sheet titled aquatic plants and their
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
role in Lake ecology and in there they
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
say however complete removal of native
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
aquatic plants is not recommended not
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
only is it costly and practical and may
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
need a permit it is detri mental to a
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
lake healthy
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
ecosystem um and then they go on to say
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
that this has been proven in a number of
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes where where
 
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
disturbances in Native aquatic
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
vegetation has occurred um in conclusion
 
01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
I I I implore and I ask that you please
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh vote Yes on um this bill I thank you
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.029 --> 01:04:24.039 align:start position:0%
Julia before Julia speaks any questions
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
for Miss Kamal
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Iran thank you Mr chair
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss komal for taking my
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
question the last photo you have is that
 
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
a picture of the machine yes oh okay and
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
so what's on top of it has already been
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
cut so yes it's a so there's a conveyor
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
belt and as the machine's cutting the
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
vegetation is supposed to go up on that
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
conveyor belt but as you can see and
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
from our experience it's not effective
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
at collecting the cut vegetation it just
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
you have wave action you have wind
 
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
action and that can cause the vegetation
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
to drift way off okay thank you any
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
other questions from Miss
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:39.789 align:start position:0%
 
can

partner
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone my name is Julia
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
Steed mosson I live on 17 Southshore
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
Drive in palum New Hampshire on Little
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
Island Pond uh I'm a biologist and
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
environmental educator I'm also uh an
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
extension educator ameritus with UNH
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension and I'm delighted
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
to be here with you today um to follow
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
on Christine's uh comments um one of the
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
things as a biologist that I know is
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly important is that when
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
natural systems and humans interact we
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes need to engage management
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's forests or fields or in our
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
case aquatic systems like Lakes um I do
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 1554 as amended uh
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is incredibly important
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
because while there is language in our
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law regarding
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
um vegetation management the emphasis
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
appears to be more on the issue of
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
invasives and yes natives are mentioned
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
but at the same time there's a there's a
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity about how how the laws
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
can actually be applied um law is not my
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse but I've been trying to read
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
very very carefully what is available
 
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
and thanks to Christine and her Eagle
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
Eye on being able to read little tiny
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
type I'm trying to learn more and
 
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
understand it more but what I can see is
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
it really appears to lead to some
 
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
confusion because of this lack of
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
clarity concerning the actual Authority
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
that Dees has regarding the management
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
of native aquatic
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
vegetation now because Lake systems are
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
very complex there's a lot of moving
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
Parts um management of these systems
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be done extremely carefully and
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
that means that need to have uh
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
Community engagement you need to have
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
good planning you need to have good
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
oversight you need to have good
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
evaluation afterwards um we also know as
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
Christine said that our native aquatic
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
vegetation is extremely important
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
because of the ecological functions that
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
they can perform and loss of Native
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
aquatic vegetation is extremely bad for
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
our ecological
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
systems so they need protection and they
 
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes need
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
management now um we have had four
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
agencies Dees New Hampshire Lakes UNH
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension uh with the lakes
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
l monitoring program and also uh the
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
private consultant for aquatic uh
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
ecosystem research and all of them have
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
cautioned us and she mentioned that
 
01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
phrase heavy-handed she caution they
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
cautioned us against a heavy-handed
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
approach to actually any aqu itic
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
vegetation management but in particular
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
when we're thinking about natives
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
because when that happens there really
 
01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
four four major kinds of things that can
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
happen one is that you can inadvertently
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
be spreading the vegetation that you're
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
trying to control because fragments
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
break off seeds gets dispersed they can
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
also cause a problem where uh when when
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
vegetation is removed nutrients can be
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
that nutrient balance can be changed and
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
therefore or that can also lead to uh
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
the situation where there's more
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
proclivity for invasives to be able to
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
establish themselves because you you've
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
changed that balance of competition the
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
other thing that's important in
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
management is being very careful that uh
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
that also you're not uh again that
 
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
change of um the balance of nutrients
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're not making it a fow ground for
 
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.709 align:start position:0%
you're not making it a fow ground for
more

01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and then the last thing is
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
that all of this again this is all
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
complicated they're all inter we we all
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
interdependent and so therefore water
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
quality can be changed as
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
well so um I have looked at several uh
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
long-term management plans uh that we
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire there's there's
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
one right here it's Flint Pond from
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hollis and they're managing for mil foil
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
I did not give you copies of it it's 48
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
pages long because it's
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive doing all those things
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned before that are
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
important with good management
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
planning I've looked at several other
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
management plans and of course Dees has
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
had to help with this thank heavens for
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
Dees so all of these plans are they're
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
they don't follow the exact same boiler
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
plate because every lake is different
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
every Community around them it's not
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
just when you're doing these plans it's
 
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
not just the lake itself but it's also
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
the the human Community as well where
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
are the L where are the the wells
 
01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
located what are the transportation
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
issues what are the roads all those
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
things that come into play with these
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
plans so this is very comprehensive it's
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
48 pages some of them are 30 some of
 
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
them are 60 now I want to show you what
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
we have for the plan for little Island
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
Pond what we have is this we have two
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
paragraphs now I want to be very clear
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
that I support Dees is this wrong no it
 
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
is not wrong is it not the best
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's not the best because
 
01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's invasive or whether it's
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
native and if their needs to be
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
management and that's part of the
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
component is is there a need that the
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's native or invasive and if
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
it has to be managed it has to be done
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
carefully so a two-page
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph doesn't appear to me to be
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
adequate however we have to remember
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
that Dees must with work within the
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines of the legislation and so
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
therefore they must be extremely careful
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
when they're actually working with
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
communities in order to enact these
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that we're talking about
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
so having said all
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
that lack of O oversight you might say
 
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
well what's the big deal there is a big
 
01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
deal because all of these aquatic
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
systems are
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
interconnected so if there's
 
01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
mismanagement in a lake like little
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
Island Pond that's going to result in
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
say more cyano bacteria we actually saw
 
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
71 days of cyano this year who knows
 
01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
what you have to watch this over time as
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
well but whatever happens in Little
 
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
Island Pond it can flow down into the
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
wetlands it can impact also people that
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
have their Wells it can flow into
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
groundwater and the and the aquifer
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
itself so it's all interconnected so
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
mismanagement in a lake can have great
 
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
implications for the lands around it as
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
well so for this
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
reason I want to say that I I again I
 
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
fully support de's work their work is
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
hard they do great work they're working
 
01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
in complex systems with the complexities
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
of us the general public but we want to
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have the right
 
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
language to give them the tools that
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
they need to do the work they do so that
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
they can help us and we can work
 
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
together to make sure that these shared
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
resources that we have in our lakes in
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
our ponds in our wetlands are protected
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
and well used and well-managed this is
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
not a one Lake issue we know know that
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
we have our waters are warming we know
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
that nutrient loading is happening in
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
our Lakes throughout the state these
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
things um the nutrient loading issue is
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
also secondary to the incremental
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
impacts of development and let's face it
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
after covid everybody wanted to go live
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
on their Lake and be away from everyone
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
else but still have a great time but
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
these complexities are really causing a
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
lot of pressure on our New Hampshire
 
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
lakes and quite frankly on our staff at
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
Dees so therefore we need to work and
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're asking you to support this
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
legislation excuse me to make sure that
 
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
Dees has the tools it needs to do so
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
that all of our Lakes are protected down
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
the line and again issues of warming
 
01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
issues of nutrient loading in issues of
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
the incremental impacts of development
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
those three things are not going to go
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
away this is our future that we need to
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
think about and we need to prepare
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves and help Dees to be able to do
 
01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
the work now but also down the line
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
having said all that I thank you very
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate all of your time I
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
know that you're very busy please
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
support this important legislation
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
brought forth by representative rulu and
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
we thank him for that as well thank you
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
any questions for the
 
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you both for
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you kindly next
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
Lakes good morning chair and members of
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Andrea lamro president
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire lakes and I'm here to
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
speak in support of HB 1554 as amended
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative Rulo Christine and
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
Julia did a terrific job explaining all
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we support this bill so
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to reiterate that this is a
 
01:16:12.629 --> 01:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
Statewide problem and going forward
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
having a proper oversight of these type
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
of projects will help to avoid unended
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
consequences of uh impacts to our water
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
quality and as a result impacts to our
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
ability to recreate impacts to property
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
values and down the line so um again I
 
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
urge you to support this bill as amended
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
any question representative R thank you
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
question uh you mentioned this is a
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide problem do you have specific
 
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
examples as was the experience at Little
 
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
Island Pond in pelum where there was a
 
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
widespread cutting of um aquatic
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
vegetation that may or may not have led
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
to problems great question I don't have
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
a specific example now um I did speak
 
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
with Amy smug at the Department of
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and she has
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
indicated in the past there have been uh
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
projects in which um rais some biolog
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
some concerns um as you know she's a
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
biologist with the Department um I'm
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
happy to reach out to see if if there
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
are any specific um examples that she's
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
able to share but at this time I'm not
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
aware of any other specific
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else that wishes to
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
speak I don't have any more pink cards
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
on HB 1554 the non gerain
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment seeing no one approaching the
 
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
mic I'll close the hearing on HB
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.840 --> 01:18:20.950 align:start position:0%

01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
we were scheduled at 10:30 to exec a
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
number of bills because of the last two
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
hearings going longer than anticipated
 
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
we'll take a short four or five minute
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
break and then we'll come back and
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
immediately uh in the order that you see
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
them listed we'll uh start to EXA those
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%

01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
motion representative representative

01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
itl on 1513 is there a second on the

motion yes I I don't see any need to
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
changed the way the board is appointed
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
now I think the bill proposes to take
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
away um important local
 
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
control and already the the governor and
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
the executive Council um appoint four of
 
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
the members of the
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
board and um I think that is
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
enough and uh the PDA seems to be
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
working very well and the chair of the
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
board definitely wanted to see the this
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
bill um it so i' would like to support
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%

to um mention representative har brought
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
up a good point um during the public
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
hearing that there may be a
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
non-legislative remedy of uh by
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
addressing this through the bylaws so I
 
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
definitely support the itl thank you
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
there anyone else wishes represent
 
01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.590 align:start position:0%
there anyone else wishes represent
representative

01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:33.149 --> 01:36:33.159 align:start position:0%
Veil thank you Mr chairman um I believe
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill would have profound
 
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
economic impact on the area surrounding
 
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
um the P's former Air Force Base and I
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
think that when you're looking at
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
cumulative impacts on the environment
 
01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
you are looking to the people that are
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
living with these impacts which are the
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
abutters to the area and to me it is an
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
incredible project um we heard in the
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that it was Forward Thinking
 
01:37:02.830 --> 01:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
30 years ago to look at what is the
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the Air Force and what
 
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
is responsibility of the state and other
 
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
federal agencies um in the transition to
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
private property so for me this would be
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
a regression that we don't want to take
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
a chance on right now so I just strongly
 
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
urge the sponsors if they're looking
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
to um to take the advice that came up
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um and come back with
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:40.119 align:start position:0%

to help stem the flow of um cyano
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
bacteria and the effect that um cutting

01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
things before we proceed thank you
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
chairman rillo for the record my name is
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
Philip trobridge from the Department of
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services um speaking
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
regarding House Bill
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
1113 um the
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
um the there's been an attempt to make
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this bill we've worked
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
with representative harb on that um and
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
that Amendment we think would benefit
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
from a little extra time to discuss with
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
other parties um a lot of the work was
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
done uh with the Realtors
 
01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
association and um having some
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
discussions today with representatives
 
01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:09.639 align:start position:0%
from the designers and installers and
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
evaluators groups uh they would like a
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
little more time to discuss it so if
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity for that um we
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
as as I as I uh as I have explained that
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
we are up against a a
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
deadline if uh we put
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the LA the last day we could
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
actually have a hearing would be if it
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
be next
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
Wednesday it would be the one day before
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
the deadline and that's cutting it well
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
very close
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
we it also would require us to come back
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
again for that
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
day uh I put going to put it to the
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
committee they want to to do this uh the
 
01:47:11.589 --> 01:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh there is also you know
 
01:47:14.669 --> 01:47:14.679 align:start position:0%
a uh possibility
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
that uh you know we could we could
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
actually correct any issue with a floor
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment if um if the if we do pass the
 
01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm going to put this to the
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
committee I see representative Wolf's
 
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
hand first but then uh representative
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
wolf then repres representative
 
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair um as you know
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
I spoke with you earlier today about uh
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
extending one week on um House Bill
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
390 I didn't realize there was anybody
 
01:47:54.189 --> 01:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
else that was was looking for an
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
extension neither did
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
I well I didn't pull out out of that um
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
anyway um now there are two possible
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
bills to that are being asked to
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
postpone um I think in the point of
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
getting our legislation right and
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
accurate and inconveniencing ourselves a
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
little bit I would suggest that we do
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
delay this for one week and hopefully
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
you'll give me the same courtesy when I
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:44.270 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um how uh is it something
 
01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:51.639 align:start position:0%
that you can work on and and fix in the
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
week and then we can back and do it on
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
Wednesday yes I believe so I think a
 
01:48:59.229 --> 01:48:59.239 align:start position:0%
number of key people have been out of
 
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
town and there's just some discussions
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
that need to be had okay great thank you
 
01:49:03.599 --> 01:49:06.390 align:start position:0%
that need to be had okay great thank you
appreciate

01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.229 --> 01:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
it follow up or follow up um in which
 
01:49:13.709 --> 01:49:13.719 align:start position:0%
case I'm good waiting a week um I will
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
put it first I need to hear
 
01:49:18.430 --> 01:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
everyone do you have want to say
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
something to
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative yes uh as Mr Trowbridge
 
01:49:24.669 --> 01:49:24.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh I had a discussion with the
 
01:49:26.910 --> 01:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
department and on Monday I talked to Mr
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
deer I'm just surprised by the request
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't mentioned to me on
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
Monday I just want the record to know
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't have put the amendment
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
forward if I had been told that perhaps
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
on Monday but I appreciate the request
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
Bale I think um thank you Mr
 
01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
chair what we should probably do is just
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
see I mean I I think that this could be
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
amended on the floor to include things
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
um that were not thought of um prior to
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
the filing of this amendment and that
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
would give us um we would still have the
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
time um my understanding is the work we
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
do on this bill will you know it it
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something that we would be
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
debating if we were to put the time into
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
putting in a floor Amendment on the
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
other hand we do have next week there
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
may be other matters that we need to um
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
postpone until next week so I leave it
 
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
do I just want to further my support for
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
um uh coming back next week um for these
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
two important bills that are not quite
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
ready uh to EXA today in my opinion
 
01:50:44.119 --> 01:50:46.390 align:start position:0%
ready uh to EXA today in my opinion
thank

01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
Rong yeah um I've worked on this bill
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
for months and I've had discussions with
 
01:50:58.510 --> 01:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
both the realtors association and Dees I
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
am curious to see what's missing from
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
the this amendment but I am willing to
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
support putting it off until next week
 
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
particularly since there's likely going
 
01:51:09.069 --> 01:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
to be another bill that we'd have to
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
delay um and and I I just have
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
tremendous appreciation to
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%

01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%

with it uh as I was dealing with my
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's as chair I have the authority to
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
call any meeting anytime I want but this
 
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.510 align:start position:0%
in this
instance

01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh I'll let the the I'll let the body
 
01:51:48.669 --> 01:51:48.679 align:start position:0%
decide whether they wish to uh spend
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%

I'll I I will not do this as I will as a
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
overall uh well a push off of of any
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
bill that we don't that we're not
 
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
certain of or don't like this is this we
 
01:52:19.709 --> 01:52:19.719 align:start position:0%
we'll do this on on each individual
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
bill now so if if because I've been I've
 
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
been told that there are some bills that
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
might that there are amendments that
 
01:52:33.629 --> 01:52:33.639 align:start position:0%
were asked for and uh may not have may
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
not be here that may
 
01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
require also the
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
our are being here another day but uh if
 
01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
we if a bill is ready to
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
go uh I I I will not uh and somebody
 
01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
just wants to move it off again that's
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
going to take another vote of this
 
01:52:59.950 --> 01:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative representative
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
mck thank you Mr chairman Mr Trish can
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
you just give us a an idea what it is
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
you may want to further
 
01:53:12.119 --> 01:53:13.790 align:start position:0%
you may want to further
modify

01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
modify
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
um just an idea of the complexity is it
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
something that we could easily change on
 
01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
the floor just to save 20 people in in
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
staff and these folks from coming back
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
next week for one bill um it I guess the
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
the the thing that we'd like to be doing
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
and we weren't aware of potential
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
concerns that were held by the designers
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
and installers side of this you know
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
part of this process and so we need to
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
have those conversations to make sure
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
that they support it uh so I don't know
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
if they will have any opposition or not
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
it may be nothing but it's a
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
conversation that we I think would be
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
good for good to be have had before
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
going to um voting it on the house
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
floor so so could be no change at
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
all and they
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
could have of course could have input
 
01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
with their representatives before we
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
vote on in the house and then again in
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate so we could come back next
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
week for absolutely no changes no
 
01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
amendments no nothing that's possible
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
thanks then Mr chairman I'd say given
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't even know there's an
 
01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.069 align:start position:0%
that we don't even know there's an
amendment

01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's Bob Dunn uh I made one slight
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment at the time to representative
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
rang's amendment that she supports which
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
was to change the time that um the
 
01:58:31.229 --> 01:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
septic system would need to be reped
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
from 6 months to one year and although I
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
always catch flak and comments on it uh
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
some of you know my major practice in
 
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
real estate is in Massachusetts and I
 
01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
was there before the startat of Title 5
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's how long I've been there and uh
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
Title 5 enables the um repair to be
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
within a year year and it's been in Mass
 
01:58:56.910 --> 01:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
for quite a while and that seems to work
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
with the Realtors the bar and everyone
 
01:59:02.069 --> 01:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
else so I just simply suggested that I
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
would make that change I did advise Mr
 
01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
deer that I would be making that change
 
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
and the board of realtor supported it
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
and told me that's was what they were
 
01:59:14.069 --> 01:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
hoping they could get so other than that
 
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
I I representative rang and I worked on
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
this and I think it's a good amendment I
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
think we're all in favor of protecting
 
01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
the Lakes and our water supplies and as
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh Mr de reminded me this is on
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
waterfront property and uh for some of
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
you that may not be aware the amendment
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh changed the 200 ft to 250 because the
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
shorland protection act is 250 I was
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
reminded of that so I think this
 
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
amendment makes sense I think it goes a
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
long way would it need amendments in the
 
01:59:49.709 --> 01:59:49.719 align:start position:0%
future I know some of you have suggested
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
maybe some I'd say yeah but I'd like to
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
see see this get into effect so that we
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
can work immediately to protect our
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
water system thank
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
you would you like to speak to your
 
02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:04.679 align:start position:0%
second yes thank you very much Mr chair
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
um I also want to bring attention to um
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
section six which addresses a lot of the
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised at the public
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
hearing regarding people buying property
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
to raise it and then build another
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
property it would need a new septic
 
02:00:21.629 --> 02:00:21.639 align:start position:0%
system design that the original build
 
02:00:24.990 --> 02:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
didn't account for that um like why
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
would we expect a seller to have a
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
operational septic system if that's just
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to be removed so that takes into
 
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
account a lot of those issues I I that
 
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
came up um and again um I I really
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate um representative har you
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
know polishing the the St the stone on
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
this one uh it really helps and it is a
 
02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
very good
 
02:00:50.430 --> 02:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment this committee has for at
 
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
least the six years I've been on it been
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
addressing Shoreline septic system
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
issues we've heard in committee um at
 
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing about the contribution they
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
have to the phosphorus that contributes
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
to cyano bacteria blooms it could be
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 11 to 20% and um this is a
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
good first step to getting a handle on
 
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
controlling phosphorus coming from fail
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
septic systems that exist on the
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.669 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:22.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Darby for a comment thank
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so this I do definitely uh
 
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
support the amendment I just wanted to
 
02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
point out a few um uh points that I made
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
to representative harb privately um
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
which is the reason I am was encouraging
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
um delaying a week so that these could
 
02:01:43.599 --> 02:01:44.589 align:start position:0%
um delaying a week so that these could
be

02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
incorporated I'll do them last to first
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
because the first is the most
 
02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
controversial but um as an example the
 
02:01:54.510 --> 02:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
um the disclosures the New Hampshire the
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
realtor disclosures um contain language
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
about um about the existing statute for
 
02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
um what is it
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
um about the the evaluation the the
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
waste the septic evaluation so those
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
forms have to change and typically um
 
02:02:15.629 --> 02:02:15.639 align:start position:0%
when the forms have to change the
 
02:02:18.069 --> 02:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
Realtors are asked to make those changes
 
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
on the first of the year and so the
 
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
effective date I think should be moved
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
to the first year rather than 60 days
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
secondly there's a few places where um
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
the it says that the evaluator these are
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
in um you know Sub sub paragraphs five
 
02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
um sub paragraphs A and B where it says
 
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
that the evaluators um need to provide
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh information or need to notify about
 
02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%
the um about the failed system but
 
02:02:48.270 --> 02:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
there's some cases where it's actually
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
the designer that detects it instead of
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
the evaluator and so the language should
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
be change to say the evaluator or
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
designer a third case is that
 
02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:01.270 align:start position:0%
designer a third case is that
um

02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
uh um so the bill says that the seller
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
the buyer can perform the um septic um
 
02:03:14.109 --> 02:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
evaluation um on um and on behalf of the
 
02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
buyer so that basically if if you think
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
your if you think your system's in
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
Failure you want to figure it out ahead
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
of time um it doesn't have that same
 
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
caveat for um if you have an old system
 
02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
that requires the septic syst septic
 
02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
system designer to come back so I think
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
that caveat should be added because
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
right now the burden is always on the
 
02:03:35.470 --> 02:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
buyer um and and those issues might not
 
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
be determined until late in the game
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
which might actually cause problems with
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
the transaction and then most
 
02:03:43.069 --> 02:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
importantly although something I'm
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
willing to overlook for um for this bill
 
02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
um for because the amendment is so
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
important is that the penalty um right
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
now of $500 if you don't comply with the
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
um the Waterfront evaluation has been
 
02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:59.350 align:start position:0%
um the Waterfront evaluation has been
removed

02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
removed
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
so potentially there's other ways that
 
02:04:04.109 --> 02:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
the this can be enforced but um the very
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
explicit $500 penalty has been removed
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
and um I think that's a consideration as
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
well so I'll be supporting the amendment
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
Unless somehow I can get people to um
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
push this out a week but um I just
 
02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to um point out my um my concerns
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
in case there is an amendment that maybe
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
these could be rolled in for the floor
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:31.480 align:start position:0%

uh chair yes that's 20 to zero motion
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
passes yeah oh now I if there's in the
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
this probably should not go on consent
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
simply because we if we do have a floor
 
02:07:54.189 --> 02:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that we want to put on it
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
would save us having to find 10 people
 
02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
and so and get it off the and also any
 
02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
time you get a something off of consent
 
02:08:05.549 --> 02:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
it's at the end of the calendar and all
 
02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of strange things happen so I was
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
go I would suggest we keep it on the uh
 
02:08:14.910 --> 02:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
on the regular calendar
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Ina in case of that need need uh
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay that closes House Bill
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%

the right section of
 
02:09:52.830 --> 02:09:52.840 align:start position:0%

um representative Aaron had originally

02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
clarifies um the same thing it allows uh
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%

we need the bill and I do know that
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
there is Ru making we are going through
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
um a time when there's an app and a
 
02:14:09.790 --> 02:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
process being developed to quickly be

um we would
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
not be giving any additional power to
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
people than they already have in statute
 
02:14:29.069 --> 02:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to mitigate the damage that
 
02:14:30.669 --> 02:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
comes from these
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
events that's what I remember from the
 
02:14:36.109 --> 02:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
testimony so at um today I'll be voting
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
against the autop pass is amended and I
 
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
look forward to the rule making to take
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
place and for us to be able to see what
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
those processes will be and see how we
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
can help with that when it comes along
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
if we need to address it in statute
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
else really quickly um thank you for
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
your comments representative veale I
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention that um we took
 
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
the language out of all already that was
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
already sort of in rules about um that
 
02:15:16.669 --> 02:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
they can only remove Woody debris uh
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
provided that sediment disturbance is
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
minimized and no in the results in no
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
new permanent impacts and that was to
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
keep it in context with um the most
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
important element of removal of Woody de
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
bre which is not to create any new
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
impacts uh to their neighbors
 
02:15:40.030 --> 02:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair I I do have a
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
question that I I appreciate very much
 
02:15:51.390 --> 02:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
the work that uh representative Harvey
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
willia put into this but I do have a
 
02:15:55.589 --> 02:15:55.599 align:start position:0%
question about what permanent impacts
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
means that I was wondering if I could
 
02:16:07.549 --> 02:16:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
about I say
 
02:16:15.709 --> 02:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh forc where you uh but on behalf of
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
the dees heard you well I ask Dees and
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Force forced as a representative of
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
Dees and the the representative of Dees
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
that um that testified on this bill uh
 
02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
to begin with that's why I would like to
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
ask her for this clarification will you
 
02:16:36.030 --> 02:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
will you
 
02:16:40.190 --> 02:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
yield the room to answer questions okay
 
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
then you heard the question can you
 
02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:45.559 align:start position:0%
comment on we we heard several scenarios
 
02:16:49.389 --> 02:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
that were discussed um uh during
 
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
testimony one of those was where you
 
02:16:55.469 --> 02:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
know new um new large rocks Boulders
 
02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
block the the main Channel and basically
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
divert the channel would you consider
 
02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:02.599 align:start position:0%
the removal of Boulders from the main
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
Channel this is a clarification yes yes
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
yes yeah but don't don't you so far I
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of you're just about to I
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
mean like literally one word away yeah
 
02:17:14.669 --> 02:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
this isn't like a regular hearing I know
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
I know but I'm just trying to understand
 
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
um if the removing of large rocks from
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
the middle of the Channel which is what
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
this says from the um from the channel
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
would be considered a permanent um a a
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
permanent what is the word here um
 
02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:34.589 align:start position:0%
permanent what is the word here um
permanent

02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:37.950 --> 02:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
impact thank you thank
 
02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
you any anyone
 
02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
else representing M since we're
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
apparently taking testimony how big do
 
02:17:48.509 --> 02:17:48.519 align:start position:0%
the rocks have to
 
02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:07.469 --> 02:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
darling Force Department of
 
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services Wetland Bureau uh
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
the question was asked what would the
 
02:18:13.709 --> 02:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
department consider to be a permanent
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
impact the permanent impact is one where
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
you are by rule already defined it's one
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
where you
 
02:18:25.389 --> 02:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
are moving sediment you are moving fill
 
02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
or you are constructing a structure with
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
no intent of undoing that change so if
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
you remove material that is or that is
 
02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
mineral material that we regulate
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
normally requiring a permit with no
 
02:18:40.110 --> 02:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
intention to
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
restore that would meet our existing
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
definition of permanent impact so this
 
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
should not get into intentional removal
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
substrates sorry representive Derby
 
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
asked you about rocks and big rocks and
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering how big do the rocks
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
have to be before you consider it a a
 
02:19:02.559 --> 02:19:05.030 align:start position:0%
have to be before you consider it a a
permanent

02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
modification like how how do you make
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
that judgment I really don't know so I'm
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
generally asking so and and that's not
 
02:19:15.629 --> 02:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
an easy question to answer because it
 
02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
would have to be something that we would
 
02:19:18.669 --> 02:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
have to be able to quantify it would
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
have to be measurable observable
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
documentable so we recognize that
 
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
anytime someone goes in and they're
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
moving Woody debris as you pick it up
 
02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
there's likely to be some fines that
 
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
will mobilize that there's no reasonable
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
way to document
 
02:19:39.389 --> 02:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
and um document that
 
02:19:41.790 --> 02:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
and measure
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
that we won't
 
02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:46.599 align:start position:0%
be it's not practical pursue that and
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's also impossible to to do the work
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
that we've telling people they could do
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
without that happening but if in fact
 
02:19:55.950 --> 02:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
you went in with equipment and began to
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
move um or mineral material around in a
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
way that you could photo document a
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
change in
 
02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:04.349 align:start position:0%
change in
Contour

02:20:04.349 --> 02:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
Contour
 
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
um either deposition or fill whether
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're adding or taking
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
away and you could measure
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
it that would be
 
02:20:19.309 --> 02:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
the that would be the threshold before
 
02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
we would take an action I I wish I could
 
02:20:23.309 --> 02:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
offer you something more but it has to
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
be a documentable measurable thing
 
02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise there's no evidence that
 
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
anything happened that we could enforce
 
02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
on no no more questions for instance
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
like if if there were a navigation ha
 
02:20:39.070 --> 02:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
third no more qu no Oh I thought you
 
02:20:40.630 --> 02:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
said further question sorry Mr chair no
 
02:20:43.230 --> 02:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
not further question sorry further wait
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
I misheard you I thought you said
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
further question you it's got obviously
 
02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
G to have to take my
 
02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:53.469 align:start position:0%
G to have to take my
medicine

02:20:53.469 --> 02:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
much I'm seeing no more no
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
more questions wish think
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
this don't don't ask her it's not for
 
02:21:08.590 --> 02:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
this is a comment only to the other
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives I'm not going to
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
clarifications representative L
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
montin um I appreciate the um that the
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is is much simpler and that
 
02:21:26.670 --> 02:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
you've included um you know that
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
sediment distur disturbance is minimized
 
02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
and the work results and no permanent
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
impacts um but I I feel
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
it initially I felt that we didn't
 
02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a problem that that
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
Dees already had
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
procedures to deal with um cleanup after
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
um an
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
event um and that people already
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
could withdraw um Woody debris from
 
02:21:58.240 --> 02:21:59.950 align:start position:0%
could withdraw um Woody debris from
streams

02:21:59.950 --> 02:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
streams
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
um but and I worry a little bit that
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're opening this up to damage being
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
called and then Dees comes in have to
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
come in later and say document that the
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
disturbance happened as a result of the
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
cleanup which was not
 
02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
permitted um you know when a after the
 
02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:21.550 align:start position:0%
permitted um you know when a after the
hearing

02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
earlier I heard um someone in favor of
 
02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
the bill saying I don't know why we just
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
can't bring our bulldozer in the Stream
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
and clean it up so that's what I'd sort
 
02:22:33.389 --> 02:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
of like to avoid
 
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
happening um and that I feel like the
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
language um still leaves it pretty wide
 
02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
open as to how um the cleanup would take
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
place so and for that reason I oppose
 
02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:49.429 align:start position:0%
place so and for that reason I oppose
the

02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:49.439 --> 02:22:50.950 align:start position:0%

much I really appreciate um
 
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
Darby's intent on the bill I completely
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
sympathize with uh the idea of wanting
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
more local
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
control um and trying to approach the
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
the uh problem in this manner he rep
 
02:26:22.030 --> 02:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
representative did did a good job with
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
um working out the public hearing
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
process but um I have to speak um
 
02:26:30.510 --> 02:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately against it on the basis of
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
what the assistant commissioner Eddie
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
Edwards said that the Department's
 
02:26:36.269 --> 02:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
current resources within the Bureau of
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
hearings to implement the pro pro uh
 
02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
policy are inadequate um and um I'd like
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
to probably speak with the
 
02:26:49.230 --> 02:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
representative um just based on my
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
experience with um being in a a plan and
 
02:26:54.429 --> 02:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
working on the planning department in a
 
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
town and filling out um and carrying out
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
the public hearing process of of uh you
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
know sending out um uh mailings um for
 
02:27:08.030 --> 02:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
notifications on
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
hearings um this although he had the the
 
02:27:13.950 --> 02:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
representative had a a lot of good
 
02:27:16.750 --> 02:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
points in here uh it's very difficult
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
for a private citizen to carry this out
 
02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:21.630 align:start position:0%
for a private citizen to carry this out
um

02:27:21.630 --> 02:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:27:27.550 --> 02:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
to document the um the mailings being
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
certified mail they have to uh hold on
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
to those um receipts for the certified
 
02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
mailings and then if there's a a problem
 
02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
with it they have to uh um there there
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
has to be a process for in a butter to
 
02:27:46.590 --> 02:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
say hey I didn't get my mail um and then
 
02:27:50.469 --> 02:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
also like possibly an appeals process um
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
I think Pro possibly the it's a a the
 
02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
intent is really I I appreciate the
 
02:27:59.070 --> 02:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
intent and possibly we can find a way to
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
do this in another more streamlined
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:09.630 --> 02:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
you representative wolf to speak the
 
02:28:15.550 --> 02:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
second thank you um I'm opposed to this
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
for another reason that I don't believe
 
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
was mentioned if we truly believe that
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
the lakes are all held in trust for
 
02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
everybody why should 25 people be able
 
02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
to have a hearing to restrict
 
02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
something and the person next
 
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
door the 26th house up wants to have
 
02:28:43.870 --> 02:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm very opposed to
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
spot I guess I'll call it spot Zoning
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
for any other
 
02:28:51.790 --> 02:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
reason um if we're going to do it do it
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
for the whole lake don't do it for this
 
02:28:59.190 --> 02:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
area and that and not for that area um
 
02:29:03.870 --> 02:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
so I don't like the idea that we will
 
02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:05.630 align:start position:0%
so I don't like the idea that we will
have

02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
varying spots on the lake and for that
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
bill anyone else to speak on the bill
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you Mr chair
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go on for five hours
 
02:29:25.309 --> 02:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
which I could easily do on this bill but
 
02:29:27.790 --> 02:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
I uh first I'll just reply very quickly
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
to um my colleagues concerns I'll note
 
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.309 align:start position:0%
to um my colleagues concerns I'll note
that

02:29:33.309 --> 02:29:33.319 align:start position:0%

02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
um the notification language in the law
 
02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
regarding horsepower and um horsepower
 
02:29:43.710 --> 02:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
and speed limit restrictions already
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
which which they there are a few of
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
these per year you can go on the website
 
02:29:50.590 --> 02:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
already requires exactly the same
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
requirement actually a slightly minor
 
02:29:53.950 --> 02:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
requirement but it does
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
require um a certified maale of 25 um
 
02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
sorry of everyone that's affected um in
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
fact the the quarter mile the butter
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
definition comes exactly from that um
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
statue with respect to um uh hearings in
 
02:30:11.950 --> 02:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
general hearings are a very well
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
established process by the department of
 
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
safety they're done uh numerous times a
 
02:30:20.590 --> 02:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
year for moins they also require 25 um
 
02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
25 uh petitioners um the fact that 20
 
02:30:27.389 --> 02:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
what what came up a lot in testimony on
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
this bill was 25 people can ban um the
 
02:30:33.870 --> 02:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
um you know can ban the sport can ban
 
02:30:35.790 --> 02:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
the activity that's that's not true at
 
02:30:39.550 --> 02:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
all um the specifically um the
 
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
department of safety has to take in um
 
02:30:44.429 --> 02:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that take into account during
 
02:30:46.269 --> 02:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
the the petition during the hearing
 
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
process and during the decision- making
 
02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the um that the what body of water
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
is a public resource and everyone has
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
access to it um and they have to find
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
they have to have a number of different
 
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
findings in order to determine that
 
02:31:04.030 --> 02:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
there's a real reason for this but
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
mostly what I'd like to
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
say um is that there's a lot of talk
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot in this committee
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot we've heard we've got
 
02:31:15.269 --> 02:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
a presentation in front of us about the
 
02:31:16.830 --> 02:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
differences between Senate bills and
 
02:31:20.269 --> 02:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
various bills and there's some some some
 
02:31:22.269 --> 02:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
people are starting to coales around
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
distances and I get distances but what
 
02:31:28.269 --> 02:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
we'll see again and again is that
 
02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
distances doesn't cover depth we heard
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
um we heard very compelling testimony
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
from a um a member on
 
02:31:40.269 --> 02:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
um the Lake's not in front of me where
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
half the lake is only wiip pocket lake
 
02:31:45.389 --> 02:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
where half the lake is only 10 ft deep
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
and because they're WG surfing in that
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the lake that's why they're
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
they're having such
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
disturbances so um so what this would
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
allow is that because we because the
 
02:31:58.070 --> 02:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
department of safety very clearly came
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
out and said we're worried about um
 
02:32:02.710 --> 02:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
trying to enforce depth restrictions
 
02:32:05.389 --> 02:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
this would allow those very sensitive
 
02:32:09.710 --> 02:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
shallow areas 10 feet depths um to be to
 
02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:10.990 align:start position:0%
shallow areas 10 feet depths um to be to
be

02:32:10.990 --> 02:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
managed we heard of course that people
 
02:32:16.030 --> 02:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
say oh you can't um WG surf in 10 ft
 
02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
well if that were the case um we
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have we we wouldn't have had
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
the problems we're seeing in wiip pocket
 
02:32:26.309 --> 02:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.550 --> 02:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
Lakes I I I could go on for a long long
 
02:32:33.870 --> 02:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
time about um about you know the the the
 
02:32:36.670 --> 02:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard but I've outlaid
 
02:32:40.110 --> 02:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
my outlined my major points on this uh
 
02:32:42.349 --> 02:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
on this sheet that I put in front of you
 
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I'd also like to say that on the
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
back of that sheet um describes the
 
02:32:49.309 --> 02:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and it describes how why the
 
02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses the concerns about
 
02:32:56.830 --> 02:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
the um about the hearings process we did
 
02:33:00.190 --> 02:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
apparently we did get a letter from um
 
02:33:02.150 --> 02:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh assistant commissioner Edwards about
 
02:33:04.910 --> 02:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
1301 I personally never saw it it wasn't
 
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
presented during testimony I never got
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
it in my email to tell you the truth I
 
02:33:10.790 --> 02:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
was frustrated that to hear about it
 
02:33:14.030 --> 02:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
this morning um but but we apparently we
 
02:33:17.309 --> 02:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
did but that was before this amendment
 
02:33:19.070 --> 02:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll just point out in particular
 
02:33:21.550 --> 02:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
here that the amendment includes
 
02:33:23.469 --> 02:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
language that allows the department of
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
safety to Define rules for when the
 
02:33:29.150 --> 02:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
hearings can take place um and those
 
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
rules will allow them to basically space
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
these out on a time frame that meets
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
their schedule so that they don't have
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
to hire um additional hearings officers
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't get a letter following that I
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
did I did speak with I did speak with
 
02:33:47.710 --> 02:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
attorney Casco the hearings um the
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
bureau chief um for hearing
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
um about my Amendment we did not get a
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
letter back after um of the impacts
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
after this
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment so I know I've already gone on
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
too long I would I wake surfing is of
 
02:34:07.950 --> 02:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
serious concern across the state serious
 
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
concern it is damaging the ecosystem and
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
it is damaging people's um people's low
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
impact uses of the lake and I would urge
 
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
you to um vote against this itm motion
 
02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.110 align:start position:0%
you to um vote against this itm motion
thank

02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:29.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:34:29.550 --> 02:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.469 --> 02:34:31.479 align:start position:0%
representative yeah representative I'm
 
02:34:34.349 --> 02:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
just looking for other okay thank you Mr
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
chair I'm also going to oppose the itl
 
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
um with great respect for my colleague
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
um representative wolf when we talk
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
about 25 people submitting a petition
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
these are people who live around the
 
02:34:50.990 --> 02:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
lake or on the lake and they are the
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
first people that are going to observe
 
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
damage or concern and this is a way for
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
them to bring that forward and have an
 
02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
objective hearing officer look at all of
 
02:35:04.990 --> 02:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
the considerations and make a
 
02:35:07.150 --> 02:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
determination each one of our lakes in
 
02:35:09.070 --> 02:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and our rivers are
 
02:35:12.590 --> 02:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
different from each other and um I think
 
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
this addresses the uniqueness of each
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
Lake um this this hearing process rather
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
than having some blanket regulation
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
across the state um this is really
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
taking into account the depth um we've
 
02:35:31.349 --> 02:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from divers from that
 
02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
diver who has saw a significant damage
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of the lake from Wake
 
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
boats um I heard from a constituent last
 
02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
night who lives on babusek lake in
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
miramac who has also seen significant
 
02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
damage from Wake boats have we heard
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
from people from Deep Lakes no it's not
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
an issue there so I don't see that
 
02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's a problem enjoy the Wake boats
 
02:35:59.070 --> 02:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
um but I think when they are placed on
 
02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
these very specific lakes that are
 
02:36:03.550 --> 02:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
brought to the attention by people who
 
02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
witness it um I think this bill helps us
 
02:36:11.790 --> 02:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
identify those problem areas and bring
 
02:36:14.429 --> 02:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
remediation so
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I I think that hearing
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
process we have to look at that as a way
 
02:36:23.550 --> 02:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
way of really pinpointing areas in our
 
02:36:26.830 --> 02:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
state where restrictions on Wake boats
 
02:36:28.990 --> 02:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
because of the damage they're doing
 
02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
should be considered thank
 
02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
you anyone else to speak representative
 
02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:37.150 align:start position:0%
you anyone else to speak representative
L

02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
L
 
02:36:41.469 --> 02:36:41.479 align:start position:0%
mon I yes um well I I agree with
 
02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative wolf that it would be um
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
we ought to pass um Statewide um
 
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
statutes about weight surfing if we're
 
02:36:56.429 --> 02:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
going to have to do that um I also agree
 
02:36:58.590 --> 02:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
with representative Rong and
 
02:37:01.150 --> 02:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
representative Darby that there will be
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
um small bodies of water where even if
 
02:37:07.469 --> 02:37:07.479 align:start position:0%
we pass other legislation which I think
 
02:37:11.349 --> 02:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
we're likely to do um there will be some
 
02:37:14.110 --> 02:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
bodies of water where the
 
02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
local um
 
02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:18.510 align:start position:0%
local um
conditions

02:37:18.510 --> 02:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
um there it's going to it's not going to
 
02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
fall under the um the broader statute
 
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
that we passed and that um people should
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
be able to bring forward a petition
 
02:37:32.349 --> 02:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
specifically to protect that body of
 
02:37:36.910 --> 02:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
water and as far as overwhelming um the
 
02:37:39.389 --> 02:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
department of safety with petitions I
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
think likely that since we are we'll
 
02:37:44.990 --> 02:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
probably get some sort of
 
02:37:47.630 --> 02:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
distance uh restrictions passed either
 
02:37:50.269 --> 02:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
with the Senate bill or 139
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
that that will take care of most of the
 
02:37:54.349 --> 02:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
petitions I think it would end up being
 
02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
a smaller number that actually have to
 
02:38:00.030 --> 02:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
or it would take care of the need for
 
02:38:02.670 --> 02:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
more petitions and it would be only a
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
small number of lakes that feel a need
 
02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
to bring a specific petition forward so
 
02:38:13.830 --> 02:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I to
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the itl for a
 
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons um this is a different
 
02:38:26.429 --> 02:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
approach than bills that we've had in
 
02:38:28.990 --> 02:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
the past and it is in keeping with what
 
02:38:30.790 --> 02:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dees has been saying with
 
02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
us down the line which defining the
 
02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
activity rather than the watercraft and
 
02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
looking at um the situation
 
02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
from an environmental impact um we
 
02:38:43.870 --> 02:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be ruling that out and we
 
02:38:47.070 --> 02:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be ruling that in um the
 
02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
problems that we're having with the
 
02:38:50.910 --> 02:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
lakes and the C bacteria and the
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
flooding um are all contributing to some
 
02:38:56.190 --> 02:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
serious conditions on the lakes and
 
02:38:58.590 --> 02:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
those conditions as we know with cyano
 
02:39:01.389 --> 02:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
bacteria really On The Rise can
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
critically impact um our state's economy
 
02:39:06.269 --> 02:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad that we're looking at this
 
02:39:07.870 --> 02:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
and we're moving forward with it and I
 
02:39:10.030 --> 02:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
hope to see more discussion of this bill
 
02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
as it makes its way through the
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
legislature um and I'm hoping that we
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
can defeat the itl so that we can bring
 
02:39:19.469 --> 02:39:19.479 align:start position:0%
a motion of um a to pass as amended I
 
02:39:22.830 --> 02:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:25.950 --> 02:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and anyone else wish to

wolf thank you Mr
 
02:39:36.990 --> 02:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm opposing this bill because
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
and maybe I shouldn't be talking about
 
02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment at this time but the bill
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
the I
 
02:39:47.550 --> 02:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
will the wording in the bill allows 25
 
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
or more residents of property own of a
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:00.030 --> 02:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
lake and there are some other places in
 
02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:01.670 align:start position:0%
lake and there are some other places in
here

02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
that I don't think are correct but
 
02:40:07.469 --> 02:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
that's a big one and as I said before
 
02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.510 --> 02:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
me I I'll surprise some people with some
 
02:40:18.110 --> 02:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
other votes down the line but this one
 
02:40:21.150 --> 02:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
is a spot zoning Bill and I'm against it
 
02:40:24.030 --> 02:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
for that very reason I understand
 
02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:25.710 align:start position:0%

process as exists for um a combination
 
02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
of wake um horsepower and um speed limit
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions and the um and
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
um ski craft restrictions both that have
 
02:45:13.469 --> 02:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
hearing processes so the these uh the
 
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
hearing process that uh is in the
 
02:45:18.550 --> 02:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
original bill um is already in existing
 
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
statute and so I see no reason not to
 
02:45:23.550 --> 02:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
pass the bill as is and I urge you to
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%

02:45:36.309 --> 02:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I want to just
 
02:45:38.830 --> 02:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
repeat what representative Darby said
 
02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
we've already had this longstanding
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
statute this is just adding wake boats
 
02:45:46.269 --> 02:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
to it and I think considering the
 
02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
environmental damage they're causing to
 
02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
shallow areas of our Lakes it's very
 
02:45:52.990 --> 02:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
important that we get something in that
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
would include this weight boats as well
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
as existing um subjects as far as
 
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
horsepower goes and those other things
 
02:46:04.469 --> 02:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
that fall under that hearing statute
 
02:46:04.479 --> 02:46:07.349 align:start position:0%
that fall under that hearing statute

chair no that's 1010 it's 1010 we
 
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
are at a deadlock the the only other
 
02:47:11.790 --> 02:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
thing we could do is a motion to interim
 
02:47:13.269 --> 02:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
study but I don't think that's going to
 
02:47:16.349 --> 02:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
go very far
 
02:47:22.349 --> 02:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
so which case declare a uh a no
 
02:47:25.550 --> 02:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation so it goes to the floor
 
02:47:29.309 --> 02:47:29.319 align:start position:0%

why we we have a uh an amendment it just
 
03:42:36.030 --> 03:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
came back from
 
03:42:41.790 --> 03:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
oll there's some errors in it um and uh
 
03:42:45.469 --> 03:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get it corrected so that we
 
03:42:52.030 --> 03:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:52.040 --> 03:42:54.349 align:start position:0%
 
bill

03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:42:57.429 --> 03:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to make this decision as
 
03:43:00.910 --> 03:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
chair I'll I'll let go ahead I'll would
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
you want
 
03:43:04.710 --> 03:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
to say something I'll I'll listen to but
 
03:43:06.070 --> 03:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't want to put this to a
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
discussion but I just want to say I
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
support representative Wolf's idea of
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
postponing the bill I think we heard a
 
03:43:16.870 --> 03:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
lot of of testimony and there are a
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
couple amendments that are coming in and
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
I think we could use some more
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
time I'm I'm the I'm and I'm going to
 
03:43:28.630 --> 03:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
make this a as a
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
chair I I see how these bills are going
 
03:43:35.189 --> 03:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
no Amendment my belief is going to
 
03:43:39.830 --> 03:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
change anybody's Minds so let's let's
 
03:43:43.990 --> 03:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
bite the bullet and put it to and put it
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
all to put it to a vot
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I'd be very surprised if any if
 
03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't if uh this is not
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
a well let's just say I let's just send
 
03:44:06.750 --> 03:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:10.830 --> 03:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
right but let's why we continue yeah
 
03:44:15.870 --> 03:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
yeah all right
 
03:44:17.830 --> 03:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair I think I need a second on
 
03:44:19.910 --> 03:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
my motion to
 
03:44:32.110 --> 03:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
MCH second uh is there do you wish to
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
speak on your motion yes I'll speak
 
03:44:41.870 --> 03:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
briefly on my motion
 
03:44:45.070 --> 03:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned in this bill about the
 
03:44:47.590 --> 03:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
depth issue about the shoreline issue
 
03:44:50.429 --> 03:44:50.439 align:start position:0%
about all the maps and plans we sh saw
 
03:44:52.110 --> 03:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
that would probably send a whole bunch
 
03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
of boats and to a
 
03:44:57.309 --> 03:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
particular uh Lake because they can't
 
03:44:59.389 --> 03:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
ride on another Lake and then there
 
03:45:02.309 --> 03:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
there's going to be congestion traffic I
 
03:45:05.830 --> 03:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
also saw the um testimony that was
 
03:45:08.950 --> 03:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
submitted uh regarding the inability of
 
03:45:12.910 --> 03:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh the Marine Patrol to uh figure depths
 
03:45:15.149 --> 03:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
and to test depths and what happens that
 
03:45:17.870 --> 03:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
the depths change so for that reason I
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill as they say is
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time that's why I moved
 
03:45:25.990 --> 03:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh to itl it I also believe that if
 
03:45:28.269 --> 03:45:28.279 align:start position:0%
there are amendments and things that uh
 
03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
the representatives on this committee
 
03:45:32.670 --> 03:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
think might be applicable to wake
 
03:45:35.389 --> 03:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
surfing I'm told that uh the Senate Bill
 
03:45:39.030 --> 03:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
431 will come to us and and that might
 
03:45:41.550 --> 03:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
be the time to bring all these other
 
03:45:46.670 --> 03:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendments in for Senate 31 43 one thank
 
03:45:49.030 --> 03:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chairman I'll support the
 
03:45:54.269 --> 03:45:54.279 align:start position:0%
motion of itl I'm a lifelong Boer and in
 
03:45:56.910 --> 03:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
depths change every day some are known
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
only to the local
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
boter we heard from the Marine Patrol
 
03:46:03.630 --> 03:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
would be almost impossible to enfor
 
03:46:05.710 --> 03:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
enforce any depth provision it would
 
03:46:07.429 --> 03:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
cost a massive amount of money and
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
personnel and resources and be difficult
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
to educate the public in terms of depth
 
03:46:15.030 --> 03:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions additionally we'd be out
 
03:46:17.510 --> 03:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
long an entire entire classes of boats
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
and I heard representatives from this
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
committee say just earlier today that we
 
03:46:25.149 --> 03:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
should be concerned about the behavior
 
03:46:27.349 --> 03:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
not the specific
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
watercraft uh that very often boats
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
other than wake boats will put off large
 
03:46:35.149 --> 03:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
wakes I've experienced that myself and
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's annoying uh and it could be
 
03:46:40.149 --> 03:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
damaging it's that behavior that we
 
03:46:43.870 --> 03:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
should enforce um not a specific class
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
of boat or single out a specific Sport
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
and cause significant e economic damage
 
03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
to our tourism industry and make us the
 
03:46:56.110 --> 03:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
only um such a restrictive state in New
 
03:46:57.910 --> 03:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
England we just it would just really be
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
bad for the state so I'll support the
 
03:47:00.990 --> 03:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
itel for those reasons there two other
 
03:47:03.110 --> 03:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
states anyone else wish to speak
 
03:47:05.229 --> 03:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
representative Derby then representative
 
03:47:08.269 --> 03:47:08.279 align:start position:0%
lante uh thank you Mr chair just to
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
correct the record um the the bill um at
 
03:47:16.990 --> 03:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
1390 as passed actually is in a or in is
 
03:47:20.590 --> 03:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
in um Place same restrictions are in
 
03:47:21.990 --> 03:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
place in Vermont so it wouldn't be the
 
03:47:25.030 --> 03:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
only state in New England but more to my
 
03:47:27.149 --> 03:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
the point that I really want to make is
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
that um we know that cyano bacteria is
 
03:47:35.710 --> 03:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
causing havoc on our Lakes we know that
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh wig surfing is not the only source of
 
03:47:40.030 --> 03:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
that cyano bacteria nobody would ever
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
presume that we just we just passed a
 
03:47:45.189 --> 03:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
bill I think we passed the bill to uh
 
03:47:47.429 --> 03:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
just recommended the bill to deal with
 
03:47:49.469 --> 03:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
um septics as a as a source of that
 
03:47:52.309 --> 03:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
cyano bacteria we passed a bill earlier
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
we recommended a bill earlier passed on
 
03:47:57.070 --> 03:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
consent to treat Lakes to treat lakes
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
with aluminum because we know how much
 
03:48:01.189 --> 03:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
of phosphorus is coming out of the
 
03:48:01.199 --> 03:48:02.229 align:start position:0%
of phosphorus is coming out of the
sediment

03:48:02.229 --> 03:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
sediment
 
03:48:06.149 --> 03:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
itself we know this committee knows that
 
03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
the sediment contains phosphorus yet
 
03:48:14.149 --> 03:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
we're willing to let boats uh and in uh
 
03:48:18.830 --> 03:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh eject this sediment into the um into
 
03:48:21.670 --> 03:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
the water water column the chief aquatic
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
biologist of Dees testified that leg
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
phosphorus um can be measured to have
 
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
been increased 20% um due to sediment
 
03:48:33.309 --> 03:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
disturbance caused by wake surfing in uh
 
03:48:35.670 --> 03:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
Waters Body Waters of water less than 20
 
03:48:38.990 --> 03:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
feet so not considering uh not
 
03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
considering depth is is um is just the
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
wrong approach uh we we need to take
 
03:48:44.399 --> 03:48:45.349 align:start position:0%
wrong approach uh we we need to take
every

03:48:45.349 --> 03:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
every
 
03:48:48.590 --> 03:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
um every effect we can in order to fight
 
03:48:51.110 --> 03:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
cyano bacteria it's poisoning our legs
 
03:48:53.630 --> 03:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's po it's poisoning our animals it's
 
03:48:56.269 --> 03:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
poisoning our residents thank you I I
 
03:48:59.990 --> 03:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
itl anyone else wish to speak
 
03:49:02.800 --> 03:49:06.670 align:start position:0%
itl anyone else wish to speak
oh

03:49:06.670 --> 03:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:10.870 --> 03:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
sores yes the Wake sports are um not the
 
03:49:13.229 --> 03:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
only reason people come to enjoy the New
 
03:49:15.670 --> 03:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes and I think it's really
 
03:49:18.590 --> 03:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
important that we keep them healthy and
 
03:49:24.670 --> 03:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
also um we're not Banning wake surfing
 
03:49:27.070 --> 03:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
the idea of the bill is to impose some
 
03:49:30.349 --> 03:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
restrictions so that other users of the
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
lake um can have their interest and how
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
they enjoy the lake also protected um in
 
03:49:40.269 --> 03:49:40.279 align:start position:0%
addition to the environmental concerns
 
03:49:42.830 --> 03:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
and I think we should oppose the itl
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
because there are some amendments that
 
03:49:46.590 --> 03:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
will will address some of the
 
03:49:50.229 --> 03:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
concerns and I don't believe that um it
 
03:49:55.550 --> 03:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
would be so expensive and impossible to
 
03:49:58.110 --> 03:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
um Define depths on a lake every Lake
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
Association knows how deep the water is
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
and various locations it would be very
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
easy to put up buoy markers defining no
 
03:50:09.229 --> 03:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
wake zones at any
 
03:50:12.070 --> 03:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
Lake um so I think we
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
should um not it the bill and allow
 
03:50:19.870 --> 03:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:23.149 --> 03:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
forward representative
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
Bale thank you Mr chair and in the
 
03:50:27.429 --> 03:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
interest of time I did bring an
 
03:50:30.110 --> 03:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
amendment um and I second what has
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:35.880 --> 03:50:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
itl

03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative I didn't I keep hear
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
seeing people pointing you but I'm not
 
03:50:48.910 --> 03:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
seeing you looking at me so all right do
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
then then then representative
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
W thank
 
03:50:57.510 --> 03:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
you I think I'm gonna go quickly first
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm G to be voting against the
 
03:51:04.189 --> 03:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
itl I'm one of those people who uh wants
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
to vote for a compromise Amendment
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the house or something
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
we Reed from the Senate um I hope we'll
 
03:51:13.990 --> 03:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
get a bill from the Senate but I don't
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
want to count on that so I'll um vote
 
03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
against this and hope to have the chance
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
to vote on a compromise
 
03:51:24.790 --> 03:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative
 
03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
w i uh second representative Simpson's
 
03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh comments originally I was going to
 
03:51:34.830 --> 03:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
vote against this bill 500 ft was just
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
too much for me to accept but we I've
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
worked it down to a couple of amendments
 
03:51:42.550 --> 03:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to move forward and have
 
03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to amend amend the bill
 
03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative hey and I were talking
 
03:51:50.590 --> 03:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
about an average depth on certain
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
Lakes um and there may be some other
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
stuff unfortunately I don't have the
 
03:51:58.149 --> 03:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
luxury and we're going to have to go
 
03:51:59.910 --> 03:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
with what I have
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
today but there is a need to do
 
03:52:07.510 --> 03:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
something and I'm not going to let the
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
perfect be the enemy of the
 
03:52:14.790 --> 03:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
good let's try and get something through
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that we don't screw it up for our
 
03:52:19.070 --> 03:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
kids and our
 
03:52:21.990 --> 03:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
grandkids the cob bacteria and the
 
03:52:24.910 --> 03:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
pollution isn't going to happen in the
 
03:52:27.750 --> 03:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
next year or two or
 
03:52:31.910 --> 03:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
three but it's like the changing
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
temperatures and people can't tell you
 
03:52:36.630 --> 03:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
tell me that I'm going to
 
03:52:39.870 --> 03:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
believe that we're not seeing change in
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
climate and temperature I know when I
 
03:52:44.590 --> 03:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
get out of my sugar house I'm starting
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
in two months earlier than I used
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
to that warmth is going to affect the
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
lakes and it's going to affect the
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
ability to use the
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
lakes and I would like to see something
 
03:52:59.070 --> 03:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
get pasted I don't know I have my
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
amendments here but we have to get off
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
and try to find a
 
03:53:08.670 --> 03:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
compromise please don't let it just go
 
03:53:12.910 --> 03:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
down the road marine industries has been
 
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
working with compromise
 
03:53:18.269 --> 03:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
we've been working let's do something
 
03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
itl anyone else to speak represent
 
03:53:26.910 --> 03:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
representative rang then
 
03:53:29.830 --> 03:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I also
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
want to remind the committee of the
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
testimony we received which I found very
 
03:53:36.550 --> 03:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
compelling from The Loon conservation
 
03:53:39.269 --> 03:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
committee or loon preservation committee
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
um and also from the diver who has gone
 
03:53:46.630 --> 03:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
under um and seeing the damage this is
 
03:53:50.429 --> 03:53:50.439 align:start position:0%
causing in Shallow areas um throughout
 
03:53:52.990 --> 03:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um last night I received
 
03:53:55.870 --> 03:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
an email from a constituent in miramac
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
who is a diver also and noted the damage
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
from Wake boats so I agree with my
 
03:54:04.950 --> 03:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
colleague from Newbury that we we can't
 
03:54:06.309 --> 03:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
kick the can down the road and I'm
 
03:54:08.429 --> 03:54:08.439 align:start position:0%
willing to look at a compromise as well
 
03:54:11.269 --> 03:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
to address a lot of these issues I also
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
want to challenge the assumption that by
 
03:54:16.269 --> 03:54:16.279 align:start position:0%
restricting weight boats in certain
 
03:54:17.910 --> 03:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
areas is going to have an economic
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
impact because anecdotally I hear from
 
03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
people who don't want to be on the Lakes
 
03:54:24.790 --> 03:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
because of the Wake booat so that's
 
03:54:26.830 --> 03:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
economic value that we're going to lose
 
03:54:30.189 --> 03:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
because of them so without a objective
 
03:54:32.349 --> 03:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial
 
03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
analysis um I I don't think it's fair to
 
03:54:36.710 --> 03:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
say that there will be an economic
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
impact thank
 
03:54:42.870 --> 03:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:46.110 --> 03:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
point I agree with representative
 
03:54:49.750 --> 03:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
wol um I also think that if if Vermont
 
03:54:52.590 --> 03:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be passing laws to restrict
 
03:54:54.990 --> 03:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to send all all of our all
 
03:54:57.590 --> 03:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
of their boers that they can't use their
 
03:54:59.510 --> 03:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
lakes and and if we're not prepared for
 
03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have a whole lot
 
03:55:01.680 --> 03:55:02.469 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have a whole lot
more

03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
boats and no restrictions keep them
 
03:55:08.670 --> 03:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
under control so I agree we should do
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.790 --> 03:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you any anyone else to
 
03:55:16.510 --> 03:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
speak on the
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
motion itl representative Donnelly um I
 
03:55:22.750 --> 03:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
just would like to talk briefly about
 
03:55:25.590 --> 03:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
the what representative talked about and
 
03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
that is we're talking about a behavior
 
03:55:31.710 --> 03:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
and now we're we're I'm for the itl due
 
03:55:33.790 --> 03:55:33.800 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we're specifying a
 
03:55:38.670 --> 03:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
craft and not the behavior so um my
 
03:55:40.750 --> 03:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
frustration with this bill is the way it
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
has been presented to go after one
 
03:55:45.070 --> 03:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
specific uh
 
03:55:48.670 --> 03:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
craft and it really what we're
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
complaining about is has to do with the
 
03:55:53.309 --> 03:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
waves and things in that for the last
 
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
two days I live on the lake the waves
 
03:55:55.870 --> 03:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
that have been coming because of the
 
03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
wind have been amazing in what they've
 
03:56:00.510 --> 03:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
done for destroying and and and making
 
03:56:03.670 --> 03:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
lots of damage against the the shoreline
 
03:56:05.830 --> 03:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
so I think we've done a lot of good
 
03:56:08.830 --> 03:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
bills in here that could do the could do
 
03:56:10.510 --> 03:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
really good things I think this this
 
03:56:13.630 --> 03:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
this bill um has flaws due to the fact
 
03:56:16.990 --> 03:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
that it's specifying a specific boat at
 
03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
a specific
 
03:56:23.590 --> 03:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
um when it's at a specific um I'll say
 
03:56:25.870 --> 03:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
plane so it's at when it's creating it's
 
03:56:27.070 --> 03:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
four- foot wake and things of that
 
03:56:28.030 --> 03:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
nature so there was a lot of good
 
03:56:29.710 --> 03:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and going back to the Loon
 
03:56:31.469 --> 03:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
preservation they only mentioned that
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
there was nothing about I because I
 
03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
asked that specific question uh you know
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
what's what's the distance and all they
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
said is you have to look at the loons
 
03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
behavior and that's true for any boting
 
03:56:43.349 --> 03:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
so we should ban all boats then on all
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
lakes because bons on them I mean I I
 
03:56:47.910 --> 03:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
think we have to be cognizant of our of
 
03:56:50.189 --> 03:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
our Wildlife absolutely but there
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be that testimony didn't
 
03:56:55.630 --> 03:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
really pan out um in my in my opinion
 
03:57:00.510 --> 03:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%

1108 okay everybody anybody need a
 
04:01:23.910 --> 04:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
chance to read
 
04:01:34.830 --> 04:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
sentence ready all right you wish to
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
speak on your on your
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes I would in the original
 
04:01:46.990 --> 04:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
bill um the wakes Sport
 
04:01:49.990 --> 04:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
Zone um the area where it says wakes wak
 
04:01:56.189 --> 04:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
permitted it says on the original bill
 
04:02:01.469 --> 04:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
on a body of water smaller than 50
 
04:02:04.030 --> 04:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
contiguous Acres that was
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
removed um on the distance from
 
04:02:12.630 --> 04:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
Shoreline that was reduced from 500 ft
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
to 300 50 ft and the waters less than 20
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
ft deep was left the same so I just
 
04:02:22.389 --> 04:02:22.399 align:start position:0%
brought this forward to see if people
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
would be more apt to
 
04:02:28.189 --> 04:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
support different limits than the ones
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:39.550 --> 04:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
that then wish to speak and your
 
04:02:42.840 --> 04:02:44.910 align:start position:0%
that then wish to speak and your
second

04:02:44.910 --> 04:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
yes I think this is um a reasonable
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
compromise and that
 
04:02:54.429 --> 04:02:54.439 align:start position:0%
um I'll repeat what other people have
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
said I think it's really important that
 
04:02:57.630 --> 04:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:03:01.229 --> 04:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
something and to just let this go
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
another year um we're likely to have
 
04:03:08.110 --> 04:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
more damage and yes of
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
course some some of these restrictions
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
will mean that some parts of lakes or
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
small lakes and
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
ponds would mean there is no wake Sport
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
Zone on that particular body of water
 
04:03:28.269 --> 04:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
but that is necessary if we're going to
 
04:03:30.429 --> 04:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
protect the water
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
quality and protect other people's
 
04:03:35.229 --> 04:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of the lake and I think the
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
depth is a really important component of
 
04:03:40.429 --> 04:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
this as we heard a lot of testimony
 
04:03:41.830 --> 04:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
about how much
 
04:03:45.149 --> 04:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
damage the Wake surface
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
does to the stirring up the settlement
 
04:03:49.790 --> 04:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
in Shallow
 
04:03:57.149 --> 04:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%

laws for not individuals but for the
 
04:06:18.110 --> 04:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
greater good of the State of New
 
04:06:20.910 --> 04:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and somebody's going to get
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
scorched and I feel badly about
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
that but there are more people that are
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
benefit by doing something
 
04:06:39.389 --> 04:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:41.830 --> 04:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
creating we have a lot of people that
 
04:06:43.790 --> 04:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
enjoy them and we have haven't
 
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
eliminated them by my motion I want them
 
04:06:49.070 --> 04:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to go out and enjoy
 
04:06:51.550 --> 04:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
themselves on the Lakes I want those
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
gentlemen over there to be able to
 
04:06:54.670 --> 04:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
continue to sell
 
04:06:59.229 --> 04:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
boats in Havens but at the same time I
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
see our Lakes turned into where those
 
04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
weed whacking machines are employed
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
fulltime they're not the only cause of
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
this the problems here
 
04:07:17.750 --> 04:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have septic systems we have high
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
winds we have a lot of things but unless
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
we pick some of the things that we can
 
04:07:24.429 --> 04:07:24.439 align:start position:0%
do something
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
about we're going to lose our ability to
 
04:07:29.349 --> 04:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
enjoy the
 
04:07:32.830 --> 04:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
Lakes I have put this bill forward and
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
I've reduced it down to something that I
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
think I know what it is and maybe you
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
people are all smarter than I am but 300
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
ft is a football field so I know how far
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
out I have to be it's not 350 not 400
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's a football
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
field a smaller Lake of 50 acres that's
 
04:07:56.910 --> 04:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
what's been in here and
 
04:08:01.389 --> 04:08:01.399 align:start position:0%
determined I have not put in a
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
depth requirement because basically if
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
you're out 300 fet you're going to be
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
over 15 ft of water and that's where my
 
04:08:16.389 --> 04:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
people at the lake cipy protective
 
04:08:19.550 --> 04:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
Association tells me it's a
 
04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
minimum now they're going to be some
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:27.630 --> 04:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
eroded no there's nothing I can do about
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
it I'm looking for the greater good I'm
 
04:08:35.870 --> 04:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
looking to preserve the lake Lakes
 
04:08:39.429 --> 04:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
plural for
 
04:08:42.510 --> 04:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
those that are my children and my
 
04:08:42.520 --> 04:08:45.349 align:start position:0%
those that are my children and my
grandchildren

04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
grandchildren
 
04:08:49.950 --> 04:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
is it perfect no it isn't and Andy
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me represented Mr chairman if I
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
had another week I probably couldn't
 
04:08:58.349 --> 04:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
make it much better so this is the one
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
that I want to move forward and if you
 
04:09:03.630 --> 04:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
people feel it's up to the the group on
 
04:09:05.990 --> 04:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall that's fine
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
too we can take the two bills and put
 
04:09:08.560 --> 04:09:09.750 align:start position:0%
too we can take the two bills and put
them

04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:09:12.750 --> 04:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
together but if we don't do something
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
and start the ball rolling
 
04:09:18.990 --> 04:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
today it's going to be that much
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
worse a year two years three years and
 
04:09:28.109 --> 04:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
will it be able to turn around I hope
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
so but when we had a record warmth in
 
04:09:33.429 --> 04:09:33.439 align:start position:0%
February I wonder whether we're going to
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
be able to turn the climate
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
around this is a climate to me and it's
 
04:09:41.910 --> 04:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
time to do something before it's too
 
04:09:45.309 --> 04:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
late I hope will pass this amendment and
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
then pass the bill so that we can move
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
forward and make what necessary changes
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.070 --> 04:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank Mr chairman thank
 
04:10:03.189 --> 04:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative wolf for bringing this
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses the depth
 
04:10:07.950 --> 04:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
issue addresses the small body of water
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
issue that we heard from our Marat
 
04:10:13.070 --> 04:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
constituents uh this will be a step
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
forward forward the the Senate Bill
 
04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
language is very close to this um I
 
04:10:24.189 --> 04:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
think it's 250 ft um and also 200 or two
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
200 thank you so it's it's quite quite
 
04:10:28.229 --> 04:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
close to this so I might still prefer
 
04:10:29.910 --> 04:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
that language but this is a good step
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
for sure so I thank representative wolf
 
04:10:34.349 --> 04:10:34.359 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward uh I think it
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
it helps out our our marac constituents
 
04:10:38.109 --> 04:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
and all of our constituents that have
 
04:10:41.469 --> 04:10:41.479 align:start position:0%
the small body of water issue especially
 
04:10:44.429 --> 04:10:44.439 align:start position:0%
uh so for those reasons I I support this
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
it still doesn't address the the
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
behavior so I think it's a it's a good
 
04:10:50.830 --> 04:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
first step and I'd encourage the Marine
 
04:10:53.710 --> 04:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
Patrol to address that with you know no
 
04:10:55.950 --> 04:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
wake zones where it's necessary and they
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
can do that on an ongoing basis Lake by
 
04:11:00.910 --> 04:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
Lake um I have a little concern on the
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note you know if they were to
 
04:11:04.590 --> 04:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
need funding to put buoys out but those
 
04:11:06.870 --> 04:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
are things they can ask for on an
 
04:11:09.429 --> 04:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis um but this brings us a
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
step closer to solving the problem and a
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
step closer um
 
04:11:15.109 --> 04:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
in you know from this committee's
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
position anyway so thank you
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative wolf and I encourage you
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
to support this amendment and then ought
 
04:11:22.510 --> 04:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
thanks thank
 
04:11:27.469 --> 04:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative wolf for being this um I
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
think it's a step in the right direction
 
04:11:34.030 --> 04:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
because any step forward is going to be
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
helpful um and I also think that
 
04:11:40.870 --> 04:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
bringing the setback to 300 feet is
 
04:11:43.229 --> 04:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
important because in in some of our
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
small lakes and in my community babus
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
lake is 228 Acres but having 300 ft um
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
it will prevent wake boats I I don't
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
know if there how much room there is
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
between each Shore but it we could have
 
04:12:02.229 --> 04:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
lakes that are greater than 50 acres but
 
04:12:04.750 --> 04:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
still wake boats would be restricted
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't be able to pass
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
down the center of the lake and still
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
clear 300 ft from each side but um I'm
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you did this I think it's a
 
04:12:15.070 --> 04:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
great compromise and I'm going to be
 
04:12:41.349 --> 04:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so mine is on not working at
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
all check everybody oh I'm back you
 
04:13:03.070 --> 04:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
never know there's somebody watching
 
04:13:04.750 --> 04:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and they're not in the
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
room things can
 
04:13:12.269 --> 04:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
happen I get to start over um yeah this
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
so this has been you know this has been
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
going on it's a long process uh we heard
 
04:13:19.269 --> 04:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
testimony that it's been 5 years that
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
people have been bringing up wake Sports
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
as an as something that they feel needs
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
to be addressed and um throughout the
 
04:13:28.349 --> 04:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
day today here we've spoken about a lot
 
04:13:30.349 --> 04:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
of environmental concerns and you've
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
heard me say the words cumulative
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
impacts over and over we really have to
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
look at everything that's happening on
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
the Lakes all sports probably impact the
 
04:13:43.630 --> 04:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
lake we can't say that you know one
 
04:13:46.830 --> 04:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
one particular crowd or one particular
 
04:13:49.229 --> 04:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
activity is really doing all of the
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
damage that's not but in the end what we
 
04:13:54.670 --> 04:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
need to do is have a compromise so that
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
the people can coexist and when we had
 
04:14:01.389 --> 04:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
the um the hearings last week in rep's
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hall we heard from someone who came in
 
04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
and he said wait a minute now we this is
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
the water is held in the public trust
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
and we all get to use it so as long as
 
04:14:13.830 --> 04:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
um we're continuing to work
 
04:14:15.510 --> 04:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
with this with all the people that and
 
04:14:16.990 --> 04:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders that have come to the
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
table so far I think we will come to a
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
compromise I'm not sure this is it but
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
I'm proud that we're working on it so
 
04:14:23.920 --> 04:14:27.790 align:start position:0%
I'm proud that we're working on it so
thank

04:14:27.790 --> 04:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:30.910 --> 04:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair I think the last
 
04:14:33.389 --> 04:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
statements of my fellow representative
 
04:14:36.349 --> 04:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
Veil tells you why I'm going to vote
 
04:14:37.469 --> 04:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
against the
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm not sure this is the
 
04:14:42.189 --> 04:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that should be passed uh I
 
04:14:43.950 --> 04:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that it needed to be worked
 
04:14:47.590 --> 04:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
on some more um so that's number one
 
04:14:51.389 --> 04:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
number two I I am from a town which is
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
only one of two towns in the entire
 
04:14:56.750 --> 04:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
state that has no standing body of water
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
so yes plasto New Hampshire so uh I'm
 
04:15:03.389 --> 04:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
sort of unbiased here because I can't
 
04:15:04.870 --> 04:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
get in trouble with any of my
 
04:15:06.990 --> 04:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
constituents because we don't have a
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
standing body of water but I I listen to
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
all the testimony I listen about the
 
04:15:14.830 --> 04:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
wind I listen about the um ice the lack
 
04:15:19.870 --> 04:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
of ice the more ice um I I listen
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
to the speed of the Wake boats I don't
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
have a boat so I look you know how fast
 
04:15:28.269 --> 04:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
do they go we're not talking about the
 
04:15:31.070 --> 04:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
um cigarette boats in Miami you know
 
04:15:33.309 --> 04:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
it's a boat I'm told that doesn't go too
 
04:15:36.269 --> 04:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
fast and um so I I listen to all this
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I think yes I I those of you that
 
04:15:42.109 --> 04:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
know me I'm always the great compromiser
 
04:15:44.109 --> 04:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
which is why I looked at the Senate bill
 
04:15:46.149 --> 04:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
and I mentioned that before I said well
 
04:15:47.710 --> 04:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
maybe the Senate Bill's got something
 
04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
that we can play with send back to the
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
Senate and compromise with the Senate um
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
so for those Reasons I'm not opposed to
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
doing something this isn't the thing I
 
04:16:00.149 --> 04:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
think I can support in the future I
 
04:16:01.790 --> 04:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
might be able to support something else
 
04:16:03.469 --> 04:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to vote against the
 
04:16:05.550 --> 04:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
amendment although I might be as
 
04:16:07.149 --> 04:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
representative Darby says once in a
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
while and the
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
minority thank
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative Derby
 
04:16:17.710 --> 04:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so you know I've
 
04:16:22.070 --> 04:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
already made my um my note my intent
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
about how how important depth is known
 
04:16:27.109 --> 04:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
so I won't repeat those arguments I will
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
say that the the specific cases that we
 
04:16:32.750 --> 04:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
heard where people are being directly
 
04:16:36.109 --> 04:16:36.119 align:start position:0%
impacted wiip pocket lake um babusek
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
Lake Arlington Pond none of those are
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
going to be saved by this bill you can
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
look at the depth Maps I've got them up
 
04:16:47.070 --> 04:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
on my screen right now um they all have
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
they're all less than 20 ft for the vast
 
04:16:51.790 --> 04:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
majority of the lake and they all have
 
04:16:53.229 --> 04:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
um they're all more than about a
 
04:16:55.870 --> 04:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
thousand feet wide so we can vote for
 
04:16:57.149 --> 04:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
this bill but we're still going to
 
04:17:01.229 --> 04:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.950 --> 04:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
Lon well I do agree that it's um it is a
 
04:17:11.030 --> 04:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
start and there's no guarantee that the
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
Senate bill is going to pass so I think
 
04:17:15.389 --> 04:17:15.399 align:start position:0%
we should keep moving forward with this
 
04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
and there's always opportunity to
 
04:17:21.030 --> 04:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
compromise or have a conference
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
to um produce a better bill but um as to
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
those other ponds let's hope that your
 
04:17:31.630 --> 04:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
bill will has a chance of passing
 
04:17:33.149 --> 04:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
because that's the only way some of
 
04:17:36.109 --> 04:17:36.119 align:start position:0%
those other ponds and small lakes might
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
be able to protect themselves since they
 
04:17:40.990 --> 04:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
clearly won't be protected by this
 
04:17:43.389 --> 04:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
restriction and it is just a restri
 
04:17:46.189 --> 04:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
restriction and it is restricting the
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
weight Sports activity wake boo is
 
04:17:52.590 --> 04:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill but it is about the
 
04:17:55.229 --> 04:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
activity not a particular boat that's
 
04:17:55.239 --> 04:17:58.109 align:start position:0%
activity not a particular boat that's
being

04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
restricted anyone else representative M
 
04:18:05.149 --> 04:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
for a second time thanks and I'll just
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
be really brief I may agree with
 
04:18:07.950 --> 04:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative harb that some of the
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill aspects or we may have to
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
change just like small things like the
 
04:18:13.550 --> 04:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
effective date because it happens the be
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the summer which could
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
be problematic so we may have to tweak
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
that using the Senate bill or maybe even
 
04:18:24.070 --> 04:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
ask the Senate to amend it further but
 
04:18:26.109 --> 04:18:26.119 align:start position:0%
it's a good step it's a good step
 
04:18:30.830 --> 04:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
forward so and anyways

you'd like to speak to your
 
04:30:29.469 --> 04:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
yes my apologies my apologies for the
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
humor um it but thank you Mr chair I I
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
um as we heard in testimony wetlands are
 
04:30:41.469 --> 04:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
is a scientifically defined term and New
 
04:30:43.149 --> 04:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shouldn't try to define the
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
term itself as it does in this bill in
 
04:30:47.349 --> 04:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
fact Wetlands is used the term is the
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
definition is used Nationwide and it
 
04:30:52.469 --> 04:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
would there would be um implications in
 
04:30:56.269 --> 04:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
terms of uh interacting with um the the
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
federal statutes if we tried to redefine
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
Wetlands um and uh Department of
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services it was very
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to you know recognizing that
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes there needs to be exclusions
 
04:31:12.070 --> 04:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
to um to permitting for wetlands in fact
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
we talked about one of those earlier
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
today um that I voted for um and they
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
suggested the permitting should be um
 
04:31:20.510 --> 04:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
based on the activities rather than
 
04:31:23.189 --> 04:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
redefining the terms so for all of those
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
reasons and others that I'm sure you
 
04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
don't want me to go into I urge you to
 
04:31:30.149 --> 04:31:30.159 align:start position:0%

maybe they even come up with an app so
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
it'll make it even easier for them
 
04:38:04.230 --> 04:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
because if they take a picture of it or
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
have an app that's what I have for my
 
04:38:07.070 --> 04:38:07.080 align:start position:0%

successful career in my working days
 
04:40:08.910 --> 04:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
although I would call these some of
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
these working days and one of the
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
reasons for that is I got great advice
 
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
along the way and I had a boss that once
 
04:40:20.470 --> 04:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
told me Rosemary you're really great at
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
leading a parade but look back once in a
 
04:40:25.830 --> 04:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
while to see if anyone's following and
 
04:40:28.110 --> 04:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
obviously with this bill I didn't have
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
many people following so I'd like to
 
04:40:33.270 --> 04:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
just you know have the parade go off
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
into the sunset and uh uh we'll let this
 
04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
go and enjoy the rest of the Beautiful
 
04:40:40.240 --> 04:40:43.230 align:start position:0%
go and enjoy the rest of the Beautiful
Day

04:40:43.230 --> 04:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
Day
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.948 --> 04:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
you wish
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
this yes Mr chair I feel she read my
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
mind before she began to speak except I
 
04:40:59.190 --> 04:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
didn't know the story but thank you so
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
much representative um rang we did have
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
a heated meeting down in reps Hall and
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
there was so many interesting facts that
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
came out and not only were they
 
04:41:12.628 --> 04:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
interested they were terrifying and I
 
04:41:14.190 --> 04:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of work ahead before
 
04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
we can look at something like this and I
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:24.070 --> 04:41:24.080 align:start position:0%

rang for bringing this bill forward
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
because while she might not have had
 
04:41:43.070 --> 04:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
many people um behind her that's true
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
she um the discussion that it uh that it
 
04:41:47.470 --> 04:41:47.480 align:start position:0%

04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in statute regarding
 
04:41:52.150 --> 04:41:52.160 align:start position:0%

start on the Senate bills any idea uh
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
probably now that we are uh finished uh
 
04:44:30.990 --> 04:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
this this finish them uh I would think
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
we would start on uh after up crossover
 
04:44:38.190 --> 04:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
and crossover is only a week or so away
 
04:44:41.070 --> 04:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
week or two away but you got the you got
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
