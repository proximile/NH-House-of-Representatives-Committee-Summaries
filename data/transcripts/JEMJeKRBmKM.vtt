577 as you are all well aware New
 
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is currently facing a housing
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
crisis that demands our immediate
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
attention and action according to recent
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
data New Hampshire has seen an alarming
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
shortage of affordable housing with an
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
estimated 20,000 new homes needed to
 
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
meet demand rental prices have soared by
 
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
over 20% over the past few years and
 
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
many residents particularly younger
 
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
people seniors and those in low-income
 
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
brackets are finding it increasingly
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to find suitable housing
 
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
within their needs the lack of
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
affordable housing is not just an
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
economic issue it's a community issue
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
families are being displaced young
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
professionals are leaving for more
 
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
affordable areas and seniors are
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
struggling to stay in their homes as
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
property taxes and housing costs rise
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
one critical solution that we can
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
Implement immediately to help address
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
this crisis is to make it easier for
 
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
homeowners to build accessory dwelling
 
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
units or adus currently the law allows
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities to regulate adus but
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
these regulations very widely creating
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
confusion and unnecessary barriers for
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
homeowners who wish to build or or
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
convert an Adu on their property adus
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
provide a flexible and efficient way to
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
create additional living space whether
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
for aging relatives as I'm sure you'll
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
hear hear about young adults just
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
starting out or as rental units to help
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
homeowners meet riseing costs
 
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some municipalities have
 
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
adopted overly restrictive rules that
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
limit property owner's ability to
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights HB 577 seeks to
 
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
address this imbalance by creating a
 
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
more form and reasonable framework for
 
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 align:start position:0%
adus across a St a state this bill
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
ensures property owners have the right
 
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
to build an Adu on their property as
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
long as it meets reasonable safety and
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
Zoning standards it preserves local
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
control where necessary but removes
 
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions upon Property Owners
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
ability to use their land effectively HB
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
577 enables a property owner to build an
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
Adu by right up to 950 Square ft and the
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
property owner can choose whether the
 
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
Adu is detached or attach the main unit
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
a key provision in this
 
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
bill moreover it's important to note
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
that the current law already recognizes
 
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
the value and potential of adus the
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
issue lies in the fact that many of the
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
restrictions imposed by municipalities
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
make it difficult costly and sometimes
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
impossible for homeowners to take
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
advantage of of this option this bill
 
00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
balances the need for local oversight
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
with a fundamental right of property
 
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 align:start position:0%
owners to make decisions about their own
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
land by supporting HB 577 this commun
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
this committee will be standing up for
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
the principles of private property
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
rights and giving homeowners the tools
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
they need to contribute to solving the
 
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
housing shortage in New Hampshire it's a
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill that benefits homeowners
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
strengthens communities and aligns with
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
our broader goals of expanding
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing options in conclusion
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee to support 577
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see from the speakers following
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
me that this is a bill that has broad
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
support across all of New Hampshire's
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
communities it's a common sense approach
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
that supports property rights while
 
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
addressing our state's growing housing
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
needs let's work together make it easier
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
for homeowners to contribute to the
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
solution thank you I'm happy to answer
 
00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you there are any
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative Reed thank you
 
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative as you
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
are very well familiar this is an issue
 
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
I've worked on for years and I'm very
 
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
passionate about and I thank you for
 
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
offering to put it in in our current
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
environment for me um so I did notice
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
that you removed uh a piece and that
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
piece is um the providing that a town on
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
a second Adu which I realized she took
 
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
out the right for the second Adu but any
 
00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:42.039 align:start position:0%
additional beyond the first Adu that a
 
00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:44.519 align:start position:0%
town may require Workforce housing uh
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
rent levels and My worry is upon
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
removing that and I'm not saying I'm
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
against the bill because you know I am
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
very passionately for the bill um but
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
removing that what that allows is for uh
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
adus to be built for the short-term
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
rental market which would be detrimental
 
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
for our housing market it would further
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
add to the very many um factors that are
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
increasing our housing costs so um can
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
you speak to how that would not be a
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
concern in your current wording well
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you again for
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan work that we've done in
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
the past fews on this bill um you've
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
been a leader on this issue um what what
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
I would say is yes that provision was
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
removed I am not not against
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
language that would clarify the
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
short-term rental provision because if
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking for long-term rentals or
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
you know or rentals for seniors or
 
00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
something like that that wouldn't be a
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
short qualify as a short-term rental um
 
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not against adding that language
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
back into
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
it yes thank you chair I just I like the
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
bill I just had a clarifying question on
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
page two line three um if I'm reading
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
that correctly does that mean that there
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
has to be a door between the two units
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering for
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
clarification why thank you um I believe
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
that and I'm I'm sure somebody will
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong there's I'm sure
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
people a lot to speak but I believe
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
that's the current law that would
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
require the if per attach would require
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
the unit to share a wall or a door in
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
between in between the two units that
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
but are there any other questions
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative Reed Mr chair this isn't
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
a question I just wanted to clarify the
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
point just raised if you would allow me
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
should yes that's um that is current
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
well current laws said that the
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
municipality could choose and this
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
language is based on the previous Bill's
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
language which removes that choice it
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
just says that the Ingress or egress has
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
to there has to be an Ingress and egress
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
point it can be external it can be
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
internal it's up to the person building
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
town thank you there any other
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
you all right I see a lot of cards here
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
and everyone wrote down three minutes
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that I will'll
 
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%

Forefront of the state's most
 
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
challenging issue
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
housing I watched the legislator's
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
efforts last session to pass an Adu bill
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
it was far reaching and perhaps a little
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
too far in that reach so recently the
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
home builders in collaboration with
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
chairman Alexander representative Reed
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
the Bia the New Hampshire Realtors the
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing and Finance
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
Authority neighborworks talk about a
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort in
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
that to bring you today a comprehensive
 
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
collaborative and effective measure to
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
address the housing needs on all levels
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
HP 577 before you here are the facts
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
this will allow by right meaning that
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
the municipality cannot say no but
 
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
instead how can we make this work
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
currently you must seek permission from
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
municipality if this passes that no
 
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
longer applies units must be limited to
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
950 square units or above but above that
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
correction is limited to 950 Square ft
 
00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to go above that you work
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
with your municipality to design and
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
build one that's
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
larger it's limited to one unit attached
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
to a detached you can have separate
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
electrical service if you wish there's
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
no familiar requirement your septic and
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
water draw must be able to sustain this
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
added unit if you have a two-bedroom
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
septic system and you're trying to add a
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom unit you have a
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
challenge this works within the original
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
framework that we have
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
now the town needs to work with you on
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
the Aesthetics a treehouse or a pirate
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
ship probably wouldn't be an acceptable
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
aesthetic or even a practical Adu
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
the Adu must be constructed to code
 
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
building permits are still required and
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
the town can no longer limit you to or
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
cannot limit you to one bedroom so with
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
that 950 if you want two-bedroom unit I
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
came with a 950 because I lived in
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
condominium that was two-bedroom two
 
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
bath 850 Square ft and that suited my
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
needs just
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
fine this will allow people stay in
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
their homes longer help them pay their
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
mortgages and property taxes but most
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
important and immediate this helps
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
infill a lot of the urban areas which
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
cuts down the
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
sprawl and this also Pro provides
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
attainable housing for those who are
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
working hard every single day the New
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire homeb Builder Association are
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
Holland good morning my name is Sarah
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
Holland I am a real estate broker in
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
central New Hampshire and I'm the
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
current chair of the public policy
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the New Hampshire
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors the Realtors ask
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
you to support HB
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
577 and in December we conducted a
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
survey of New Hampshire residents and we
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
asked them if they support the current
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
law requiring municipalities to allow an
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
attached Adu and 90% said that they
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
supported that statute we then asked if
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
they would ex support expanding the law
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
to allow either an attached or a
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
detached Adu by right and 81% supported
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
the concept and this bill in front of
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
you is just that so it's not surprising
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing this type of report
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
considering the same survey showed that
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
half of our residents are not confident
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
that they could find adequate housing in
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
their Community if they had to move
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
Realtors see this housing anxiety every
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
day parents who have um aging children
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
are unable to afford housing families
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
who have elderly parents can no longer
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
live independently and caregivers who
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
need to find Housing close by those that
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
they are caring for accessory dwelling
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
units need to be an option
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
so think of two families they live on
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
the same road a mile apart but in
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
different towns they each have lived in
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
their home for decades never thinking
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
nor worrying
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
about that the time might come when they
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
need to take care of a parent or a child
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
one family is allowed to build an Adu
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
because they live on one side of the
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
Town Line the other family is prohibited
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
from doing so because they happen to
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
just live on the other side of that town
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
line property private property rights
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
should not be extinguished because youve
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
crossed a Town Line the state has a
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
proper role to play to protect all
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
residents and their basic property
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
rights keep in mind under this bill as
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
previously stated if a property owner
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
cannot provide adequate septic for an
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
Adu they cannot build it if they don't
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
have access to water they cannot build
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
it if the Adu does not have an adequate
 
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
buffer from Wetlands or neighboring
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
properties then they cannot build you
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
have to adhere to all Town ordinances
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
and building requirements this build
 
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
does not change that we sometimes hear
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
claims that an Adu will impact property
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
values of neighboring homes there's no
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
evidence to suggest that this is true in
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
fact published data shows that an Adu
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
increases the value of the property and
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that building an
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
Adu is not
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
inexpensive logic would then suggest
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
that if my property inre increases in
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
value that does not mean my neighbor
 
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
goes down and generally it's quite the
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
opposite my property value raises so
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
does my neighbors there are plenty of
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire some which
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
would be considered affin or wealthier
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
towns which currently allow for detached
 
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
adus there's been no complaints that
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
have Arisen from those neighboring
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
Property Owners or that values have
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
decreased so this is an one of those
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
important steps to alleviating our
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
state's housing crisis as you'll hear
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
lots of stories today so we we ask you
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Brian chirichello
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a Dairy resident um I am a real
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
estate agent I've been a real estate
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
agent for 25 years but I'm here to
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
represent myself and I want to paint a
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
picture uh of of what I am going through
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the town of Derry 10 years ago I
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
built an oversized 2car garage now my
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
house is let me back up my house is
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
1903 it's a
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
1356 foot New Englander on a third of an
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
acre I'm on Town water and town sewer 10
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
years ago I built
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
a a oversized two-car garage on the
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
property and up above it I uh I I made a
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
man cave uh okay to watchh
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
football still have the furniture up
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
there still have the TV up there the bar
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
the whole n yards but interestingly
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
enough I don't use it anymore it's
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
roughly a little bigger than 550 square
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
feet but in the town the town of dairy
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
does not allow me on Water and Sewer to
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
make that an Adu because their
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
requirement is it has to be
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
attached I mean I suppose I could get a
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
2x4 and nail it on one side and the
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
other but you know I'm not about to do
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
that my point is is that this particular
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill if you want to um
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
solve the affordability issue this is
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
really the perfect Bill to do that um
 
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
because when you're Building Homes
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
you're got to buy land we're not buying
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
land in a lot of cases we' you've
 
00:19:59.789 --> 00:19:59.799 align:start position:0%
already got that land and in my case
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
I've already got that space sitting
 
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
there now the benefit to me is as I'm
 
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
getting older I could rent that out at
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
an affordable rate of let's I'm just
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
throwing a number out there $1,500 a
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
month in my town I think the average
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
rent is 2500 and I'm the fourth largest
 
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the state the fourth
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
largest community I'd be more than happy
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
to rent that out for $1,500 a month to
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
somebody that that's in crisis or a
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
traveling nurse or somebody that's just
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
starting out so
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
yes I I guess I could go to zoning board
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
um but then I've got to prove a hardship
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that that's necessary
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to tackle
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
affordability this bill does the job I
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
think this is a very very good bill and
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
I would urge you to pass that thank you
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions if anyone has
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
any thank you thank you there any
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
much Notch
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
Gra NCH sorry thank you thank you Mr
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
chair n Grace for the business and
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
industry Association we are the
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce I want to
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank the uh we support this legislation
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
I want to thank the sponsor for bringing
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
it forward the co-sponsors and along
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
with a number of other members of the
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and past members of the
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
legislature in this room who have worked
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
on this over the years um we believe
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
this is a sensible update to the 2017
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
Adu law as you just heard uh we have a
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
number of examples antidotal examples
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
across the state of really kind of
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
bizarre requirements that don't make a
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
lot of sense where we could add
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
additional housing units um not only for
 
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
traveling nurses but often times for
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
family members and they just can't be
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
utilized uh given the given the current
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
state of things um so this strikes a
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
great balance uh between local control
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
and um and also uh the need to do more
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
with housing because it still requires
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
that uh you know people building adus
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
follow all of those local processes and
 
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
local codes as Mr Mayberry pointed out
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
um but it does open up the ability to uh
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
to develop these sensible units um to a
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
wider audience here and IT addresses a
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
number of issues uh that have been um
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
raised over the years like the water
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
septic sewer issue uh and and um along
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
with the conversion of some unused
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
buildings that are already on property
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave it at that but I'm
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to take any questions
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
the committee may have thank you there
 
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.269 align:start position:0%

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
support family caregivers a key issue in
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire facilitate Aging in place
 
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
strengthen intergenerational living

expand affordable housing options and
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
address Workforce housing needs I get
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
into more detail in my written testimony
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
which hard copies are here so you don't
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
have to remember things um one story
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to share with you that
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrates some of these benefits one
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
of our members talked about one of her
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
granddaughters who recently with her
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
partner moved into an Adu and this Adu
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
was built by an elderly gentleman who
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
was about ready to retire uh by her
 
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
moving in there it was a win-win for
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
both parties um she was struggling to
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
find housing and was able to find an
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing unit and the landlord
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
one because he's going to be getting
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
income to help him in his golden years
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
so that's one story and now I'll turn it
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
over to Sharon to tell another story
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
well actually that was my story
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
but so anyway we're on the same page
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
which is great so good morning um
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
members of the House housing committee
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
my name is Sharon Monroe and I'm also a
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
volunteer in um for AARP so actually I
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
was at a social Gathering a couple of
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and the you know people
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
started talking about housing and
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units how the impact
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
is on their um family members and this
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
was a situation where their
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
granddaughter was just entering in the
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
workforce and oh and they were uh just
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
entering in the workforce and they
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't find any available housing or
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
afford it and actually it was um an
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
elderly gentleman in a house that um he
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
rented the AG you to this young couple
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
and they were very happy and independent
 
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
starting out um and then his plan was to
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
um when he retired move into the Adu
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
himself and then rent out a house which
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
could free up you know housing for a
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
larger family um so anyway I think that
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
story um is similar to Stephanie's and
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
it exemplifies how adus can benefit our
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
communities by not only creating more
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
housing but also allowing for additional
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
income for older adults as they near
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
retirement and a limited income um thank
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
you for listening and I ask that you
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
consider passing this legislation which
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
is a step forwards to Al toward
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
alleviating the housing shortage in our
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
state any questions thank you do we have
 
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
any questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
much thank you for
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the House
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
housing committee I'm Nick Taylor I'm
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
the executive director of housing action
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're a Statewide advocacy
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
organization that supports increased
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
access to housing our members include
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
developers homeless shelters lenders
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
property managers and more uh we're here
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
in strong support of House Bill 577 you
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of the points that have been made
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
won't repeat them around affordability
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
around property rights but we just
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
really find adus to be a fantastic
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
attainable housing option that really
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
adds to our communities without you know
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
making a huge um impact in terms of how
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods feel it's a great
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity with the garages barns
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
existing structures the standardization
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
that comes from this right now about
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
half communities in New Hampshire allow
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
for detached adus half don't there's a
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
patchwork of regulatory framework that
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
makes it diffic difficult for the market
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
to mature in terms terms of contractors
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
and developers that specialize in
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
building adus it also makes it difficult
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
for lenders to assess the risk in terms
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
of you know creating construction loans
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
and products that make sense for people
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to build uh adus in their
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
communities we have started to seen some
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
Community Banks lend in this space and
 
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
create products because there's a strong
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
desire this will just continue to unlock
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
that market and is a great you know
 
00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
solution for New Hampshire so happy to
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you any
 
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:30.760 align:start position:0%

much V from Peterboro I can't read the
 
00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.750 align:start position:0%
much V from Peterboro I can't read the
first

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
name was is it oh Ivy welcome iy I'm
 
00:27:45.389 --> 00:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
still Ivy van from Peterboro uh thank
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
you for letting me speak as you know
 
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
this is a thing I care deeply about um I
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
am a land use planner um I'm a certified
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
land use planner I've been working oh
 
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
gosh 10 or 15 years now I have done a
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
lot of Housing Opportunity planning
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
Grant work
 
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
for about 12 or 14 towns in New
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the last two years and one
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
of the things that I have seen over and
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
over and over again is Adu ordinances in
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
individual towns that don't make any
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
sense and that are clearly had been
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
adopted to restrict the construction of
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units accessory
 
00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799 align:start position:0%
dwelling units
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
are they're just so cute we should you
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
know and and and we talk we talk about
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
this in the work that I do a lot whether
 
00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:42.039 align:start position:0%
things are cute or not is actually
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
important and you know we we know that
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
we need housing and you know people when
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
you say well we need to build more
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
housing in neighborhoods what people
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
imagine is a 40 unit Lite building and
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
that's not that's never what I'm talking
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
about I'm always talking about
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
house-sized multifamilies but even even
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
smaller and more Charming are accessory
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
dwelling units and they feel a huge need
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
um as everyone has said before me
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
they're great for people who are
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
starting out they're great for people
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
whose house has gotten too big for them
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
all of those things and having the Adu
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
ordinances uniform across the state is
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
really important it makes it easier for
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
those Niche developers who are building
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
adus to be sure that they can do that
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
it's better for the banks for the
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
lending it's better for everyone I mean
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
I have seen accessory dwelling unit
 
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances that require not only an
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
interior door but that the space between
 
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
the main house and the and the Adu be
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
heated I've seen ordinances require four
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
parking places for an Adu this seems
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
outrageous um and I'm just delighted
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
with this building it's sort of
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
everything I would ever have asked for
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's what I tell towns they ought to do
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I want to talk
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
about just briefly is the whole question
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
of short-term rental towns can restrict
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
that and that's a thing for towns to do
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
individually the one thing I would
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
remind the board of or the committee of
 
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
sorry is that um building an Adu is not
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
cheap and sometimes in order to make the
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
money work to create another unit you
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
need to be able to short-term rent that
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
unit for some amount of time um and
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's just an economic fact we know
 
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
that even before well we don't know
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with lumber
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
prices but even before the UN current
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
uncertainty about lumber prices we know
 
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
that um square foot prices are between 3
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
and a/4 and 375 a square foot and that's
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
you know that's IKEA cabinets friends
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
and neighbors that is not fancy adus
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
tend to be
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
expensive um per square foot because
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
they're small and you have to have all
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
the parts for a bigger unit in that
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
smaller unit and sometimes the numbers
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
just won't work unless you can get the
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
higher price of a of a short-term rental
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
and here's the thing once a unit exists
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
then it can become all kinds of things
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
over the course of its life it it may
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
not be a short-term rental forever it
 
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
may only be a short-term rental for a
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
year or so because frankly having a
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
short-term rental is annoying um people
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
think that this is going to be a really
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
swell idea but changing those sheets and
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
cleaning those bathrooms once a week GH
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
um so I would just caution the committee
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
about putting restrictions about whether
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
or not the Adu can be used as a
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
short-term rental for those reasons
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
um and I think I've said everything I
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to say anybody have any questions
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
the committee see none thank
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
you okay I'll be back in a
 
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.870 align:start position:0%
you okay I'll be back in a
bit

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.029 align:start position:0%
bit

young people across New Hampshire I am
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
here today to testify in support of
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
577 uh to expand the definition of
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units and remove
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
barriers uh that limit their development
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
um you know you'll hear you've heard
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
from a lot of folks today so to
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
summarize um adus have a lot of benefits
 
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
for retirees and seniors in the granite
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
state but also for young people who are
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
just starting out and finding it
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult to afford homes
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh near their jobs uh their families and
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
the communities that they want to stay
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
in um as the cost of living continues to
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
rise it's important more now than ever
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
to create housing options that meet the
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
diverse needs of people at different
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
stages of their life and uh House Bill
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
577 would do that I personally know the
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
impact of uh accessory dwelling units
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
and they that they can have on
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
affordability I live in a home with an
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
Adu um my partner uh dad lives with us
 
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
and it's made a significant difference
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
in our ability to afford living uh in
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
our community and staying there um so I
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
that's from my own personal experience
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
why I would urge you to support House
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 577 um this bill matters because it
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
creates more housing choices it creates
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
more affordable uh accessible housing
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
Cho options for everyone removes
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
barriers to adus and it meets the
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
diverse housing needs of our state um by
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
passing this bill you could uh help make
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire more affordable uh and
 
00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
livable for people at all stages of life
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
and so why we urge you to vote uh a to
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 577 thank you and I
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
would take any questions thank you there
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
are any questions from the committee
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much see you
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
Murray good morning Mr chairman and uh
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
Grace Murray and I live in Amherst and I
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
work as the political director of New
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire youth movement and I'm here to
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
testify in support of HB
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
577 I've talked to hundreds of young
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
people and college students about the
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
issues they care about and
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
unsurprisingly housing is one of the
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
biggest stressors for a young person in
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire today as a college student
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
housing is stressful because most people
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
can't afford to live in school provided
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
housing because of the high cost and
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
there's never enough off-campus housing
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
to go around it honestly doesn't get
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
much better after graduation I've had
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
many friends move out of state because
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
of the lack of housing here even though
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
they wanted to stay these people were
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
teachers lab techs nurses and more New
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would benefit from having more
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
young people in these professions but
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
because there were no homes for them
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
they had to
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
leave I grew up in New Hampshire I went
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
to school here and I plan on continuing
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
to live to live here but if our housing
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
Supply doesn't increase the choice to
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
stay in New Hampshire might not be up to
 
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:28.750 align:start position:0%
stay in New Hampshire might not be up to
me

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
the thing is I don't want to leave New
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have really deep roots here
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm heavily involved in my community
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
I spent a lot of time and effort
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
building my life here and I don't think
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
that I or any other young person should
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
be forced to move out of a state we love
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
just because our housing shortage has
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
been left to municipalities to fix local
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
government has had decades to address
 
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
this problem but the housing crisis is
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
just getting worse and it's time for
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide Solutions cutting the red tape
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
for property owners to build accessory
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
dwelling units is the kind of strong
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that will make a POS
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
positive impact on the young people in
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire adus can be rented out to
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
a student a recent graduate or someone
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
else with a modest income for college
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
students and graduates adus can also be
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity to live near work in
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
school in a smaller space at a lower
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
cost while also remaining close to
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
amenities these units have a low impact
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
on the neighborhoods that they're in
 
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
while also having a high payoff uh
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
towards the crisis that we're
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
facing we need more places that college
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
students graduates and young Working
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
Families just starting out can afford
 
00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what this legislation
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
would result in I urge you all to
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
support HB 577 and give young people a
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
chance to stay in our state thank you
 
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
desar okay but I'm Sarah Burt Cohen I
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
think you put both of us yep
 
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
um so my name is good morning my name is
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
Sarah Burke Cohen I uh represent the New
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association the new
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
opposes the spell
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
um this would um make a local uh zoning
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
mandate for mun municipalities as you
 
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
all know every municipality is different
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
um it mandates um it creates a zoning
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
density issue um which is going to put a
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
lot of stress on on infrastructures that
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
are already stressed out um we also feel
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
like there are no requirements that um I
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
think one of the representative Reed
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
might have brought up that any of these
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
adus will be anything more than um
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
short-term uh rentals there's nothing
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
that says that these adus will be
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
affordable housing or requiring them to
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
be Workforce housing which will probably
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
not solve the problem for housing in New
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um with that um like I said
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
the nhma opposes this based on the fact
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
that local control of whether adus are
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
built needs to remain with the local uh
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
local governance um in order for um
 
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
these towns and mun these towns and
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
cities to know what's best for their
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
residents and for the health and safety
 
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
of their residents and their
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I'll take questions thank
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
you there any questions from the
 
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative deont hi
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um could you tell me what the
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
major difference would be from what the
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
way the law is today versus this bill
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
other than obviously a conjoining
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
wall I think that the major difference
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
right now is the detached right it's
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's adding a detached unit um I think
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
the other issue we have um which I
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
actually thank you for your question um
 
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
it also uh takes out the ability for a
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
municipality to determine the lot size
 
00:38:59.470 --> 00:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
um as you know
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
uh lot sizes can be problematic and this
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
needs to stay in local control as well
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
um because if you have a detached
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
accessory unit it could require um an
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
increase in the lot size and this bill
 
00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
takes that ability for a municipality to
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
determine whether a increased lot side
 
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
out there any other questions
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I just walked on the end of
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
your explanation so if this is an
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
ignorant question then I apologize but I
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
believe what I just heard you say is
 
00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't support this bill
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
because it might increase the lot you
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
might need an increase in lot size and
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
removes the town's ability to to require
 
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.390 align:start position:0%
removes the town's ability to to require
an

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
increase is that the question was what
 
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
the difference right um with this bill
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
and as I said to representative Dumont
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
part of what this bill takes out is a
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
municipal municipalities ability um
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
allow accessory um sorry detached
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units if in judging
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
whether it needs an additional lot a
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
bigger lot size it has that ability to
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
do that in current in the current
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislation in front of you that delete
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
deletes that repeals that portion um the
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
nhma believes that local control is
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
important for a number of reasons
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure issues um stress on
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um health and safety with
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know sewage capacity and water
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
capacity um as well as
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
um that was it I'm sorry lost my train
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
of thought no that's fine I was
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
clarifying because I wanted to ask a
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
question may asked the question follow
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
you followup thank you um so my
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of the current law from
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
2017 is actually while there may be an
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
ability for a town to require a larger
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
lot size for say something that they're
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
not having to approve like a detached or
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
a second ad
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
there is no current law that you
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
actually can build an Adu the town can
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
limit other things like parking lot
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
requirements or parking space
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
requirements but there's no ability in
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
our current law as I understand it um
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
for a town to require a certain lot size
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
on an attached Adu and I guess my
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
question is why would you need a larger
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
attached unless you want me I I'm gonna
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to actually turn it over to my
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
associate Brody he he actually may know
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
you if that's okay with the chair yes
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
state your name for the record please uh
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
my name is bires I represent the Amire
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association um let me crack
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
notes so your question was in regards to
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
why would we treat a essentially why
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
would we treat a detached Adu separately
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
from an attached Adu correct
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
specifically why if the Adu is the same
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
size why would you need a bigger lot
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
size for a detached versus attached
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
because a detach could as long as it um
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
conforms to the requirements of the
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
Planning and Zoning is not next to the
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit I mean you may need more
 
00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:23.559 align:start position:0%
space um you also may need additional
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
lot size for sewage disposal and um
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
health and safety of the community so um
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
I mean our position is that um and then
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's also Conformity to
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities have an interest in
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
um in the integrity and the character of
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and how they look and so
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
um an attached Adu obviously I mean
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
they're very different in nature while
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
they Ser Sim while they serve similar
 
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
purposes um detach you know having a
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
separate dwelling unit essentially a
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
second you know what would be like a
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
second um Abode on your property um it
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
may require a additional um it may
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
require additional space and then there
 
00:43:02.349 --> 00:43:02.359 align:start position:0%
are some things that the bill doesn't
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
consider for example um like ledge or
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
other things that might be on the lot
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
that really limit the building envelope
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
so if you don't require maybe additional
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
acreage um you know you could have a
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
1acre lot with an existing unit and then
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you could find out that
 
00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:21.079 align:start position:0%
3/4 of the lot is ledge that isn't
 
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
really buildable um and that could
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
create other issues for how the density
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
looks further question you may inquire
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I hear the words you're
 
00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559 align:start position:0%
saying but I don't understand why you
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
would need the ability to set a larger
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
lot limit if it's ledge that's already
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
determined like whether or not you can
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
build in that space is already
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
determined so if it's ledge it's ledge
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
you can't build there right you can't
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
build it anyway um if it's what was the
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
other thing oh this like setbacks like
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
you need a larger lot because there's
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
not enough space well if there's not
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
enough space to build then there's not
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
space to build there anyway so why would
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
you need the ability if there's not
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
enough room on that lot given the
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
setbacks to build one then you can't
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
they can't build it anyway so why would
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
you need the ability to prohibit them
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
from building it except for on a larger
 
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
lot if they can't build it anyway and
 
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
the water and sewer doesn't make sense
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
to me because 500 square fet one bedroom
 
00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:19.270 align:start position:0%
to me because 500 square fet one bedroom
one

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
bathroom has the same requirements for
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
water and sewer as does whether it's
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
attached or detached so I I'm hearing
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and it doesn't make
 
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
sense why a town would need to have
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
extended abilities to set lot limits
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
when all those they wouldn't be able to
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
build it according to current law and
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
according to this bill anyway according
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
what you just
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
said um my reading of the bill is
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
different but that's okay representative
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
um you threw a lot out there what is
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
your specific question if I may
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
clarify so my specific question was um
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
originally why why would a town need to
 
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
set a a larger lot limit on an attach a
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
detach and I realize I'm answering the
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the person testifying his question
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
um why would a town need the ability to
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
set a larger lot limit on a detached
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
versus an attach which they currently
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to I heard a
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
bunch of answers that didn't actually
 
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
make any sense and I was giving you the
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make sense of those
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
answers based on what I responded with
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
so if if you just want to leave it as
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
you read it differently then that's fine
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
we can leave it
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
there than there any other
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody else in the room
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
housing affordability uh as I've
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
disclaimed in the past I'm representing
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
my own views and not the views of the
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
MRA although I don't think anybody in
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
the group uh would object to me saying
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
that they're very in favor of adus uh
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
one of the the work groups that I'm
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
involved with there is uh specifically
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
focused on Adu education uh we have an
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
event coming up to kind of educate the
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
population of uh the madok region on uh
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
their options there uh so there's a lot
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
of reasons to be in favor of adus um I
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
think several other people have already
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
spoken to the multigenerational benefits
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
um there's also pretty significant
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
financial benefits uh in including um
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
the the ability to age in place uh which
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
supports multigeneration as well as uh
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
the needs of the elderly population um
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
but also for young people uh who are
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing their first home uh as I
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
bought my first home when I was 26 and
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
um the ability to rent out extra space
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
in that home made just a huge difference
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
in my ability to uh build a financial
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
base and continue to exist in a state
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
where the cost of housing is continually
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
Rising uh and at this point um I own
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
eight properties in New Hampshire I
 
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
don't own any single family properties
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh they they're Money Pit um and uh even
 
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
my own primary residence we have an Adu
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
in the basement that covers the property
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
taxes um just kind of pulling out my
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
financial calculator here if you picture
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who who you know purchases
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
their first home at the age of 30 they
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
have about 35 years before they reach
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
retirement age and if they were getting
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
$1,500 a month not adjusted for
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
inflation uh and they were putting that
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
into their uh 401K uh because they've
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
now freed up some of their housing
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
expense they'd be looking at a
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
retirement Nest Egg of $2.7 million and
 
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
with a safe withdrawal rate of 4% that's
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
a six figure income that is the
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
difference between an uncomfortable
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
retirement on you know the the median
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
social security benefit is around $1900
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
a month and a very comfortable uh
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
retirement so I see this as a great
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to set people up for success
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
in the future um you know people who are
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
going to rented out on a short-term
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
basis um as as the uh woman from
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
Peterboro mentioned um you do need that
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
in order to get over the high cost of
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
construction upfront I I don't see the
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
increase in short-term rentals is being
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
fundamentally detrimental uh if anything
 
00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:39.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to lower rates in the
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
short-term housing market and make it
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
less of a viable alternative uh and so I
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
think you know that would create some
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
Market pressures for people to convert
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
their short-term rentals into more
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
traditional housing um but it's you know
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to find that equilibrium
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
point so uh that's all I have to say on
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you there any questions seeing
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
none thank you very
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
much Brian you had something you wanted
 
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:13.109 align:start position:0%
much Brian you had something you wanted
to

00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
add thank you for allowing me to come
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
back up a second time I'll be really
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
really brief um I noticed on bullet
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
point number 26 uh and I've seen this
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
where um some communities will actually
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
have this
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh and I think that this is important
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
because what this bill does is it takes
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
it out it's a municipality shall not
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
require a familiar a f a family
 
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
relationship between the occupants of an
 
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit and the
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
occupants of a uh principal dwelling
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
unit so some of these some of these the
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
language in some towns not my
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
town uh are not going to allow an Adu
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
unless it's a family member I don't know
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
how you police that number one but more
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
importantly what this bill does is puts
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
a stop to that because it is out there
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to point that out
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
because I didn't hear anything um
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
discussed about that representative Reed
 
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so that's actually
 
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
current law the bill as written because
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
there were enough changes it's not doing
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
the strike and the Bold it's just saying
 
00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:12.799 align:start position:0%
this entire section is going to be
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
replaced but I would say about 90% is
 
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
actually in current law it's just a few
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
little tweaks but that is currently in
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
law you are correct there are some
 
00:50:23.789 --> 00:50:23.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities who have illegally put
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
into their zoning practices restrictions
 
00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
on and I've pointed it out in this very
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
committee last year um if they enforce
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
those ordinances then they could be sued
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
they're putting them indeed restrictions
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's right and it's
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
not going to solve the problem that we
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
all want to address is the affordability
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
of housing especially for the elderly or
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
the younger family so thank you very
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
much thank you is there anybody else
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
would like to testify on
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
can just recess to
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire as we all know New
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is facing a severe housing
 
01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
crisis with riseing cross and growing
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
demand for affordable living spaces in
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
this context one of the most important
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
rights we can protect and expand is the
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
right of property owners to use their
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
land how they see fit within the bounds
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
of reasonable public regulation HB 685
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
is designed to support these public
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
these private property rights while also
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
addressing the housing shortage at its
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
core HB 685 provides a clear path
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
forward for manufactured housing to be
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
allowed in all residentially zoned areas
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire by doing so it
 
01:02:40.349 --> 01:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
ensures property owners have the right
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
to utilize their land for manufactured
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
housing without unnecessary restrictions
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%

RSA
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
67431 to clarify the definition of
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing this definition
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
includes homes that are built on
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
permanent chassis designed to be used as
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
a dwelling and connected to essential
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
utilities like Plumbing Heating and
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
electrical systems it's important to
 
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
note that this bill specifically
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
excludes Campers or recreational
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles ensuring that we are focusing
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
on permanent residential solutions that
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
will stand the test of time section two
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
is the heart of this bill it mandates
 
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
that manufactured housing be PR be
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
permitted in all residential zones with
 
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
every municipality in New Hampshire this
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
is a strong protection for private
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
property rights of individuals that wish
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
to place these homes on their land it
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
ensures that no municipality can
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
restrict or prohibit the use of the
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
housing in in residential
 
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
areas um allowing the property owner the
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
discretion further section two requires
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal zoning ordinances be amended
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
to comply with the statute eliminating
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
local restrictions that may otherwise
 
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
unfairly limit or discriminate against
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing
 
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
Property Owners should have the freedom
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
to develop their
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
land section three establishes a
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
six-month timeline to amend their zoning
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
ordinances ensuring that we act swiftly
 
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
on local reg regulations with this new
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
policy Additionally the Department of
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development will
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
oversee compliance provide
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities with support and guidance
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
they need I believe there's an amendment
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
floating around by representative Paige
 
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
um that would move the timeline out to
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
comply with this section I'm I'm totally
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
in support of that amendment by passing
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
85 will expand property rights increase
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
housing options Empower individuals and
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
families across New Hampshire and just
 
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:35.799 align:start position:0%
to put in perspective I represent um a
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
town of gtown that has a very beautiful
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturing house co-op in town um
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
called medville cooperative and um you
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
know there's different processes in
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
which they could um establish their own
 
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
co-ops but I think what's important is I
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
get calls from Granite Staters across
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
the state because of this bill and
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
another bill that was signed into law
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
last year about hey I want to I bought a
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
huge property I want to build a bunch of
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing on this property so
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
my family can live together in a
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
compound I get those calls all the time
 
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
local ordinances prohibit this sort of
 
01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
thing from happening unless they get in
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
a co-op this is totally going to free up
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
that right for them to do that um
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
provided they follow um water sewer
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
standards things like that but um I
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
think this is a step in the right
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
direction I think we need a lot more
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
small houses across the state and
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing is one of the key
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
pieces of puzzle so I'm happy to answer
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
questions there's people here hopefully
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
to speak in support thank you we have
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Reed thank
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
for putting in this bill and adding me
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor I am in support um I do
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
notice that the language specifically
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
exempts modular and other um pre-site
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
built pre-fabricated housing and I was
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
wondering why do that instead of include
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
that type of housing I'm not talking
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
about RVs or Campers or anything without
 
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
a foundation um but why not include
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
other um non-stick built housing uh in
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
this to allow as many options as
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
possible for someone to be able to buy a
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
piece of land and put up something
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
affordable that is safe specifically um
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
in this is language that was discussed
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
in this committee last term um as long
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
as it meets state and federal building
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
code um why not expand not just
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing but quanset prefab
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
modular all of those well thank you very
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
much for the question and thank you
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
again for being a co-sponsor on this
 
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
bill um I will confer with the chair of
 
01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
the committee but I believe that this
 
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
can have a work session next week where
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
I believe the committee can discuss more
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
about this I'm certainly open to
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.269 --> 01:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander I have a
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
question about section
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
five uh it says the Department of
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development shall
 
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
oversee and ensure compliance with this
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
statute providing guidance and support
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
to municipalities as needed to my
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge the state of New Hampshire
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a Department of Housing and
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
urbanville did I miss something no you
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
didn't miss something I'm totally
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
willing to scratch that okay sentence
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
out and and that I would if that would
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
be my that's my only concern with the
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill uh just cuz on the being on the
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
receiving end of this legislation I may
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
wind up in a town where they say well
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
you need to get approval from the
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
Development who says to me who are you
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
and why are you calling us well
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully it functions a little more
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
effectively now but I wouldn't want to
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
call the feds for this well my point is
 
01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
dealing on the local planning board
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
level they may use this you may have
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
this wonderful Bill and it may all work
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
fine and then they're going to say up
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
you got to check that box you can't do
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
that representative Aron thank you for
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward I my question
 
01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
is how would this affect the building of
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
trailer parks which are not allowed in
 
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
certain municipalities well this I mean
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
so a key piece to this legislation is
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
the this enables manufactured housing
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
this is different than a trailer Park
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
Model and it and I think the key piece
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
is the permanent chassis component where
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's something where it's a permanent
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
stable housing option and typically when
 
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
you find trailer parks they're more
 
01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
mobile um can be you know moved from
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
town to town things like that so this is
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
a more stable housing option so they're
 
01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.430 align:start position:0%
a more stable housing option so they're
not

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
related and I think that's part of the
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
conversation is is letting the public
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
know that there's a separation there's
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
no there's not a relation
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
there representative Reed thank you Mr
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
chair and I'm just asking because I'm
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
struggling to understand this so are we
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
def the question was regarding trailer
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
parks are we defining trailer parks in
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
the traditional kind of colloquial use
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
which is a manufactured housing Park
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
which is these would be the same type of
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
units or are we talking about like RV
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
camper Parks um and which this would not
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
address whatsoever um and
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
then further if the concern is that this
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
would allow the creation of subdivisions
 
01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
of manufactured
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
housing um then then would it not be
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
prudent to put in something along the
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
lines of for a um owner occupied lot for
 
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
example they can buy their own and that
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
an a manufactured house can substitute
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
for an Adu for example or any other
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
thing that's
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
allowed uh stick built allowed in the
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
town you can substitute a manufactured
 
01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.990 align:start position:0%
town you can substitute a manufactured
house

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
um but not the creation of a subdivision
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
of manufactured housing if that's my
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
understanding of the original intent of
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
the question yeah I thank you for the
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
question I don't think that any of that
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
language is required because if this
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill goes through if you're in a
 
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
residentially zoned area and you want to
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
build a manufactured house provided you
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
follow you know the typical requirements
 
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
a planning board goes through um setback
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
requirements water sewer infrastructure
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
things like that you should be allowed
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
to build it so um the same process would
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
happen under a subdivision as you would
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
go through that sort of process as
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
well are there any other
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
Bronson good morning chairman and
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um my name's
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
Abby Bronson I am a born and raised
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
Granite stator I currently live in
 
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester ward 3 but I'm here today as
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
the Director of policy and advocacy for
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund uh
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund as
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
you might know is a nonprofit lender um
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
primarily what we do is we help
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
residents in manufactured home
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
communities purchase their parks to
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
become resident-owned but we also um
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
provide Fair fixed rate 30-year
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
mortgages for manufactured housing um
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here in strong support of HP 685 um
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate representative
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
Alexander for bringing this bill forward
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
um we support it because we believe
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
it'll help more New Hampshire families
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
achieve the American dream of home
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
ownership um rep Alexander said it and
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
you'll probably hear it every day in
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
this committee um we're in a housing
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
Supply and affordability crisis um and
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
we have to use every tool available to
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
address it um this bill would create one
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
such very important tool um and will put
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
home ownership within reach as I said um
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
and just increase the supply of housing
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
which we all know we desperately need um
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
so when in an environment where the
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
median cost of a single family home is
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed U manufactured homes
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
represent an affordable option in fact
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
right now in most um of our
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
resident-owned communities you can own a
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured home for less than renting
 
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
a an apartment of the same size um this
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
won't be the case if we don't make it
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
easier to place new manufactured housing
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
units as is done in six HP
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
685 um as representative Alexander
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned it would allow manufactured
 
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
housing by right and res entally zoned
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
areas um and it'll just make it more
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
accessible for younger families to
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
purchase their first home and older
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters to downs siiz we heard a
 
01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
lot um in for the last bill um about the
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
importance of multigenerational living
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing also creates and
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
provides a lot of that um I also would
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
be remiss not to note manufactured homes
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
are not only affordable they're safe and
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
dignified housing they're on par with
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
site-built homes in terms of durability
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
and safety allowing them all residential
 
01:12:58.350 --> 01:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
areas will not only serve to benefit
 
01:12:59.950 --> 01:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
will only serve to benefit the cities
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
and towns across the state because they
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
desperately need housing for their
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
workers so I urge you to vote a to pass
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
on HP 685 thank you thank you there any
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you all for letting me talk again
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
I'm Ivy van I'm a land Ed planner in the
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I'm here to
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh manufactured
 
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
housing is not your Granddaddy's hunting
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
camp anymore manufactured housing units
 
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
are attractive safe they appreciate like
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
a regular house they no longer
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
depreciate like cars which they did in
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
the past they're built to strict
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
standards they ought to be treated like
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
any other form of housing as a planner
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm particularly interested in the
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
possibility of being able to use
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing units in what are
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
called um Cottage courts which is a
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
small grouping of cottages on a single
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
lot with shared systems shared water and
 
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
septic systems or water and sewer if you
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
have that well in septic otherwise those
 
01:14:23.229 --> 01:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
are ways where people can live more
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
inexpensively in community and
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing is a great use um
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
in those those um clusters of housing so
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to urge the committee to
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
support this bill and thank you all
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
again thank you there any questions
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank
 
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you so much um my
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
name is Sarah Holland I am a real estate
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
broker in central New Hampshire and I am
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
the 2025 chair of the public policy
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
committee for the New Hampshire
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors and the Realtors
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
ask for your support on HB
 
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
685 manufactured housing is a critical
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
component in New Hampshire's housing
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
landscape making up about 10% of
 
01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
residential sales in 2024 so just last
 
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
year it is also a more affordable option
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
for for many New Hampshire residents
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
with a median sale price of
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
$162,000 opposed to as opposed to the
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
$514,000 median sale price for a single
 
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
family home currently in the state it's
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
also worth noting that manufactured
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
housing prices are increasing faster
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
than single family homes since 2019 the
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
median priced single family home
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
increased 71% while the manufactured
 
01:15:56.629 --> 01:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
homes have increased by 138 8% going
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
from 68,000 to
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
162,000 the interest and demand for such
 
01:16:06.669 --> 01:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
housing is only increasing as a
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
costeffective solution to the inventory
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
shortage government regulations largely
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
local Municipal zoning ordinances have
 
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
been used to prevent the mar the private
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
Market from meeting the demand of such
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
housing this bill is a long overdue fix
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
for that towns opposed manufactured
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
housing out of a bias against more
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
affordable housing options believing it
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
will alter the character of the
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
neighborhood it is an outdated notion of
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
what manufactured housing looks like
 
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
today today's manufactured homes often
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
resemble traditional homes blending
 
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
seamlessly into neighborhoods often
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
having foundations with basements and
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
garages while maintaining high quality
 
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
living conditions as you previously have
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
heard and we need to remember this is
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
not the government's land this is
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
private property as long as a
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
community's health and safety are
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
protected then the government should
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
always tread very lightly on mandating
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
what you or I can do with our properties
 
01:17:00.159 --> 01:17:01.470 align:start position:0%
what you or I can do with our properties

67416 States very specifically that the
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
intent of zoning in New Hampshire is for
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of promoting the health
 
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
safety or the general welfare of the
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
community the argument I just don't like
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
that sort of housing is not a health
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
safety or general welfare argument
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
zoning in New Hampshire has veered quite
 
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
a distance from its original intent of
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
separating incompatible land uses
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
the residential use of a home is still
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
the residential use of a home regardless
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
of how much it costs to construct or how
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
big that home might be if you're in
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
favor of growing New Hampshire's economy
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
then pass this bill since this is how
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
our Workforce which is our businesses
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
which our businesses desperately need
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
will find more affordable housing if
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of ensuring New
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire R retirees find a more
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable home to enjoy their
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
retirement then support this bill this
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
is how they can downsize and live on
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
fixed income if you want to protect
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
private proper property rights please
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
also support this bill we ask you to
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
support HB 685 thank you for your time
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you there any questions to the
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative buer thank you
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um uh did I hear you uh
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
correctly that you said that the median
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
sale price on manufactured housing is
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
162,000 yes wow that is that is
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
substantially less um does that is that
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
for that figure does that also include
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing where the land
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
underneath is leased so there is a wide
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
range as far as pricing goes um for
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
homes for that specific reason whether
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
they're in a community in which that
 
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
land is rented um which you do have to
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
factor in that homeowner cost of paying
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
that lot rent um and then Properties or
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes on their own land so
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
it is a wide wide
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
range representative
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you just to clarify what was
 
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
just brought up I believe that median
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
cost is just the manufactured house
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
irrespective of where it's going to go
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
and I know this from checking out the
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
prices there are plenty in the 200,000
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
up to $300,000 figures um very nice
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
places that I think anybody here would
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
be extremely happy to live um so is that
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
correct it's regardless of the so it is
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
the median purchase price of a
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured home so that takes into
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
account those that are being sold on
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
rented lot space and those that are on
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
private land it's the median of that but
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's some that are sold that I
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
apologize follow up sure the question
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
you may inquire uh there are some most
 
01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
well most of the time when people buy
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
new ones they are buying it from a
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
dealer not on so they have a piece of
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
land they are separately purchasing just
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
the manufactured house yeah and that is
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
not part of our data because we're
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
generally not a part of that process
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
only once it's already located on a
 
01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
piece of property are there any other
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:05.629 align:start position:0%

01:20:05.629 --> 01:20:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman members of
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Nick Taylor I'm the
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
director of housing action New Hampshire
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
still a Statewide organization that
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
advocates for pro housing policies we
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
are here in support of House Bill 685 um
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
the housing affordability conversation
 
01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
often focuses on rental units this is a
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
great opportunity for home ownership
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
below the median sales price which has
 
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
been persistently up above 500,000 in
 
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:31.719 align:start position:0%
recent quarters so this is a real great
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to expand affordable home
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
ownership we Echo the property rights
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
and health and safety um conversations
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
that have been brought forward by other
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
speakers and also say to the question of
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
the definitions we really appreciate the
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
um interest in some of the other
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
Innovative construction models around 3D
 
01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
printing and prefab our understanding is
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
that at least in this bill those are
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
just in relation to the definition
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
section not in terms of being prohibited
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
on existing lands We Have You Know
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
spoken with companies that are doing 3D
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
printing homes in New Hampshire that are
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
not running into these prohibitions
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
already right and so it may be pertinent
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
and relevant for the committee to think
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
about making sure that that's not
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
something that could come forward but as
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
of now that is not something that a
 
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
community is prohibiting in terms of the
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
other types of construction to our
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge so um again we really we full
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
support there's no reason to treat these
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
any differently than any other type of
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
construction it's all rooted in stigma
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
in our opinion and so we again
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the committee and hope you
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
look favorably upon this Bill thank you
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are any questions seeing none
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
deales hi for the record uh Brody Dees I
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
Association um and we are opposed to
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 685
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
um we believe that local decisions are
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
best made by um local residents and the
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
voting booth um we think that planning
 
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
boards uh can um best make decisions to
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
represent their their constituents and
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
residents and to propose uh zoning
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendments and planning amendments to
 
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
the um to the local ordinances that bet
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
best meet the municipality's needs um I
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
think our our biggest concern with this
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
bill is specifically in section 2 Roman
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
3 where it says no municipality shall
 
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
adopt or enforce any Zing ordinances
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
regulation or policy that discriminates
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
against manufactured housing by
 
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
prohibiting or unreasonably restricting
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
its placement in residential zones we
 
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
find that to be very Broad and open and
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
maybe tough for interpretation for
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities that want to adopt
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable zoning or planning
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
requirements for a manufactured home um
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
so that is our biggest concern is having
 
01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
that unclarity for local planning boards
 
01:22:53.629 --> 01:22:53.639 align:start position:0%
zoning boards and um others who help in
 
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
the uh planning department Department of
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
the municipality and um with that I will
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
um take any questions thank you Mr
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
chairman or Mr Vice chairman thank you
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
there any questions representative Paige
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so I look I look
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
pretty favorably upon this bill um and I
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
Echo a lot of the um comments earlier
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
about a lot of this being rooted in
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
stigma um but I also want to be
 
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
responsive to what I just heard from you
 
01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:24.950 align:start position:0%
responsive to what I just heard from you
uh

01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
about that Roman numeral 3 so my
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
question for you is sort of what what
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable restrictions would
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
nhma like articulated here you know I'm
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think what those
 
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable restrictions might be and if
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
you have guidance for us on what you
 
01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
want to see this to be a fixed property
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
which I know can be tough with
 
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing because you're
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to want to put that in a slab and
 
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to want it to be movable
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
but um you know having a fixed having it
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
be in a fixed real property I think is
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
an important aspect I think design
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
aspects are important to municipality
 
01:23:58.990 --> 01:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
especially a residential neighborhood um
 
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to want it to meet the
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
planning um design requirements uh
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
depending on the situation um so I think
 
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
those are just two off the top of my
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
head that I can think of where there is
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
a compelling Community interests to make
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
sure that the type of manufactured home
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
and how it looks and ensuring that's
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's a fixed real property that it
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
actually stays there and someone isn't
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
just going to put a slab and then
 
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
eventually decide well I'm going to move
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
to a neighboring municipality and leave
 
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
the slab in the empty lot there um I
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
think that's important so I think those
 
01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
are two things that I can think of that
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities would probably look to
 
01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
guidance for us and some may argue is
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
that a reasonable or unreasonable well
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
when we use terms like that in the
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
statute and don't Define them or don't
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
point to some other statute that has
 
01:24:43.629 --> 01:24:43.639 align:start position:0%
good definitions then um then what ends
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
up happening is municipalities they're
 
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
using their discretion to the best of
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
their ability to listen to their
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
residents and then you have people who
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
are trying to develop and utilize this
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh statute who are going to say well
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
from my opinion that's unreasonable from
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
the municipality's re uh vantage point
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
it might be very reasonable and it might
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
be even extremely reasonable to the rest
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
of the residents that adopted specific
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
planning ordinances or zoning ordinances
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
municipality there any other
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody else that would
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
like to testify on HB
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
all right uh hello again uh Chris
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
Freeman and I am here to testify in
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
favor of House Bill 685 um in addition
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
to expanding and affirming the property
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
rights of land owners uh as others have
 
01:25:38.669 --> 01:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned it also does create a more
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
accessible Bottom Rung on the lad for
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
home ownership uh with prices in the sub
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
$200,000 range um the the gentleman from
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
from Peterboro raised the cottage courts
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
I would raise that as a potential area
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
if you do take this back to Workshop
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
that you um consider contacting some
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from the different
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities I know Keen New Hampshire
 
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
has recently um adopted a cottage core
 
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
ordinance and reading through it um as
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
is the tendency of that planning board
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat prescriptive and I would
 
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that when we're
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about the ways that
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities are adopting Cottage core
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
ordinances and the way that this um
 
01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
proposal could be implemented at the
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
state level that we don't create any
 
01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
ambiguities or conflicts um that would
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
preempt uh you know Developers in uh the
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
different towns from being able to make
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
sense of uh what their options are uh
 
01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
where we could end up confounding
 
01:26:35.229 --> 01:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
property rights um but uh generally
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
speaking um I think we just heard that
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
there's concerns about U maybe the
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics people have talked about the
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
stigma associated with these uh first of
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
all if you can build a split level you
 
01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
should be able to build what's basically
 
01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
should be able to build what's basically
a

01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
ranch um but uh you know some of the
 
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
concerns around uh where these might be
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
built you know and am I you know a
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
doctor in Handover concerned about uh
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
you know a trailer moving in across the
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
street from my10 million estate chances
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
are the buyer who's going to be
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
purchasing that land is not going to be
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
building a uh a manufactured home um the
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
market forces do tend to equalize uh the
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
types of construction that people choose
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
to develop in different areas
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
um uh so so there is that um but in in
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
general neighborhoods uh there is
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
evidence that socioeconomic diversity is
 
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
a really strong engine of upward
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
Mobility um you know if you are somebody
 
01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
who is just getting started and and and
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
you know building your uh Financial base
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
and you live in a neighborhood where
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
there are people who are further along
 
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
in that Journey than you it does open
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
doors uh for you to be able
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
to start a small business maybe your
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
neighbor is going to loan you money
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
towards your startup um you know
 
01:27:50.109 --> 01:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
certainly being able to borrow against
 
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
the equity in your home uh you know
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
strongly advances those goals um so all
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
around I see this as as pretty strongly
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh beneficial uh and that is all oh
 
01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
actually one one other point um when we
 
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
do Place restrictions on uh on mobile
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
homes uh based on stigma um you know we
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
have we have
 
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
this this tendency of planning boards to
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
try to preserve the existing character
 
01:28:19.109 --> 01:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
of of neighborhoods because they want to
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
support higher property values and the
 
01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
problem with that is that if you are
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
using state power to support
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
individual's property values what you're
 
01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
really doing is you're upwardly
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
redistributing wealth and I think that
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
that's really an unethical uh violation
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
of the the property rights of wouldbe
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
homeowners and that's all I have thank
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
you are there any
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
much is there anybody else that like to
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
testify okay I'll close the hearing on
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
685 turn the gavel back over to the
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
okay so um given the questions asked
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
about the first two bills we're going to
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
take those to work sessions next Tuesday
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
I'll publish that in the calendar um we
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't have any hearings next Tuesday so
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday will just be for us to work
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
through the language of um some of these
 
01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.149 align:start position:0%
through the language of um some of these
bills

01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
um at this time we don't have a full
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
committee so I don't want to exact um
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
some bills that uh we may we may not
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
agree on but I do think I have one bill
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to exec and then we can go
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
to lunch um that
 
01:29:40.719 --> 01:29:42.310 align:start position:0%
to lunch um that
is

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
604 and
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
I I confir with the ranking member
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
you're good with this y okay
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
um so at this point I'll call on
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron to make a motion on
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.109 --> 01:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
604 thank you Mr chair I move that we
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
retain this bill to work on it uh in the
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
future because there's some language in
 
01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
here that's not quite clear I second
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay so move by representative Aaron
 
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
second by representative Reed to retain
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
HP 604 comments on
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
this I I think there's some Merit to it
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that um I'd like to hash out
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
some of the details I think maybe
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
building a revolving fund or something
 
01:30:30.669 --> 01:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
and putting a dollar in it would be more
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
value I don't really love the provision
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
about the workforce housing range that
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
there is so I'd like to kind of work on
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
it and see and I think this maybe we
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
could come to a bipartison agreement on
 
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.390 align:start position:0%
could come to a bipartison agreement on
it

01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
so all right um are you
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
ready represent page I was I was just
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
going to say I agree and I think um some
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
of the comments today on the other Adu
 
01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
Bill we were hearing this morning really
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
get at that the heart of that
 
01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
affordability question and I applaud the
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor for trying to find solutions to
 
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
try to make this pencil um for folks who
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
want to put in adus um because I you
 
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
know if we're passing this Adu bill that
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
we heard this morning we also want to
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have um that we have
 
01:31:18.669 --> 01:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
those solutions for folks so that they
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
can actually afford to put them in so I
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
think they go hand inand and I'm happy
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
to retain it
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
all right you ready y okay the Kirk will
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
call the
 
01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
roll Vice chairman Cole
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative Faxton yes
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron yes representative
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
Buu yes representative Dumont yes
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
miles representative Miner yes
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
clerk reinford yes representative Paige
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
boras representative Reed yes
 
01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.109 align:start position:0%
boras representative Reed yes
representative

01:32:09.109 --> 01:32:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
Gibbs representative Hicks yes
 
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:15.880 align:start position:0%

yes representative Kerwin

01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
so the vote was uh 15 to zero that
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
motion carries um so at this point we
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a full committee I don't want
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
to pull up any more exec sessions so uh
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have a a rather lengthy lengthy lunch
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
um I do believe representative Cole has
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
to introduce a bill at 1:00 in another
 
01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
committee so because there's I can't I
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
can't share my own bill I'm going to
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
recess until 1:15 and we'll hear how
 
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
spill 459 at that time okay so we are at
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:52.709 align:start position:0%

Xander um thank you Mr chair members of

the committee this is the last time you

hear from me today in this position and
 
03:17:57.990 --> 03:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
bear with me this is probably my longest
 
03:18:01.990 --> 03:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
set of remarks um and as we know I'm
 
03:18:03.670 --> 03:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
here to introduce HB
 
03:18:06.349 --> 03:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
459 as we know the housing crisis in New
 
03:18:08.110 --> 03:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is urgent and the time for
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
Meaningful action is now for years we've
 
03:18:13.349 --> 03:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
seen skyrocketing housing costs that put
 
03:18:16.030 --> 03:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
homeownership Out Of Reach for too many
 
03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
hardworking Grant Staters from young
 
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
families to essential workers the
 
03:18:22.830 --> 03:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
inability to find affordable housing has
 
03:18:25.110 --> 03:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
had a profound impact on our economy and
 
03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:25.790 align:start position:0%
had a profound impact on our economy and
our

03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
communities let me Begin by explaining
 
03:18:30.189 --> 03:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
where I come from I'm a full-time
 
03:18:32.670 --> 03:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
Bartender by trade as you may or may not
 
03:18:35.349 --> 03:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
know it can be a pretty lucrative trade
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
and you can live a comfortable life
 
03:18:38.870 --> 03:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
however being in the hospitality
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
industry does not make you a rich person
 
03:18:43.469 --> 03:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
unless you open your own place it does
 
03:18:45.590 --> 03:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
however allow you to live comfortably
 
03:18:47.590 --> 03:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
under our current system Grand estaters
 
03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
like myself do not have the same
 
03:18:51.429 --> 03:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to own property partly due
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
to unreasonable lot
 
03:18:56.110 --> 03:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
sizes hb4 59 addresses the most
 
03:18:57.750 --> 03:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
significant obstacles to affordable
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
housing in our state restrictive minimum
 
03:19:02.950 --> 03:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
lot size requirements that unnecessarily
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
inflate the cost of building new homes
 
03:19:08.309 --> 03:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
for too long regulations have demanded
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
large lot sizes that make it impossible
 
03:19:12.510 --> 03:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
for small or more affordable homes these
 
03:19:14.910 --> 03:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions have often been used to
 
03:19:18.590 --> 03:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
enforce snob zoning a term used to
 
03:19:20.189 --> 03:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
describe zoning practices that
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
deliberately limit access to housing in
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
certain communities by pricing out
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
working families and people of modest
 
03:19:29.710 --> 03:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
means let's call it what it is it's snob
 
03:19:32.349 --> 03:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
zoning it's about keeping people out and
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's been a tactic used in our
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities to preserve the status
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
quo and exclude those who can't afford
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
to buy into the existing system these
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
zoning laws often reflect a desire to
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
protect the interest of those who
 
03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
already own property and they aim to
 
03:19:49.469 --> 03:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
keep the wrong type of people from
 
03:19:52.269 --> 03:19:52.279 align:start position:0%
moving in it's not about preserving the
 
03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
environment it's not about Community
 
03:19:57.070 --> 03:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics it's about
 
03:19:59.870 --> 03:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
exclusion in my opinion teachers
 
03:20:03.189 --> 03:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
firefighters police officers bartenders
 
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
Amazon Prime delivery drivers are not
 
03:20:07.070 --> 03:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
the wrong type of people but
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately under our current system
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
people are zoned out of communities HB
 
03:20:13.990 --> 03:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
459 is a direct response to this
 
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
thinking this bill would require
 
03:20:17.870 --> 03:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities eliminate unreasonable
 
03:20:20.110 --> 03:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
minimum lot sizes for single family
 
03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
residential homes particularly when it
 
03:20:24.070 --> 03:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
comes to those lots that aren't
 
03:20:26.389 --> 03:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
connected to Municipal sewer systems
 
03:20:29.870 --> 03:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
under HP 459 municipalities can no
 
03:20:32.349 --> 03:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
longer impose lot sizes that are
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
excessively large without showing
 
03:20:36.389 --> 03:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
evidence that it's truly necessary for
 
03:20:38.790 --> 03:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
the community's health or safety
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
specifically HP 459 proposes that in
 
03:20:44.990 --> 03:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
areas without Municipal um or Community
 
03:20:47.630 --> 03:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
sewer systems no or ordance can require
 
03:20:49.469 --> 03:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
a single family lot larger than what is
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to accommodate an individual
 
03:20:55.950 --> 03:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
sewer Disposal system as defined by Dees
 
03:20:58.030 --> 03:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
for lot served by municipal or Community
 
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
sewer infrastructure the bill limits the
 
03:21:02.710 --> 03:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size to 22,000 Square ft for
 
03:21:03.950 --> 03:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
the committee's reference that's about
 
03:21:07.469 --> 03:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
half an acre unless the town can provide
 
03:21:09.510 --> 03:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
solid evidence that a larger lot size is
 
03:21:11.750 --> 03:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
needed for public health or
 
03:21:13.750 --> 03:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
safety this bill would make it easier
 
03:21:15.389 --> 03:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
for developers to build homes that are
 
03:21:17.070 --> 03:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
affordable and available to those who
 
03:21:19.750 --> 03:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
need them by limiting unnecessary
 
03:21:22.030 --> 03:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions on law sizes we'll see the
 
03:21:24.550 --> 03:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
creation of smaller more costeffective
 
03:21:26.790 --> 03:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
homes that will ultimately lead to lower
 
03:21:26.800 --> 03:21:27.950 align:start position:0%
homes that will ultimately lead to lower
housing

03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:21:30.990 --> 03:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
prices let me be clear this is not about
 
03:21:33.150 --> 03:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
forcing municipalities to abandoned
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations entirely it's about
 
03:21:38.030 --> 03:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
striking a balance between local control
 
03:21:40.910 --> 03:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that we can build the homes
 
03:21:43.510 --> 03:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
we need to keep up with demand local
 
03:21:44.990 --> 03:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
governments still have the ability to
 
03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
make other zoning decisions as long as
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
they don't involve excessive lotsize
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
requirements that price people out of
 
03:21:50.880 --> 03:21:52.229 align:start position:0%
requirements that price people out of
the

03:21:52.229 --> 03:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:21:54.910 --> 03:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
market my friends from the new New
 
03:21:57.030 --> 03:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association will no
 
03:21:58.429 --> 03:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
doubt come out against this bill which
 
03:22:00.510 --> 03:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
is fine I hope the committee members
 
03:22:03.349 --> 03:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
will be shed enough to ask and HMA why
 
03:22:04.750 --> 03:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
they believe municipalities should have
 
03:22:07.750 --> 03:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
the right to set minimum lot sizes that
 
03:22:09.910 --> 03:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
far outpace what is necessary for the
 
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
health and safety of the community who
 
03:22:13.269 --> 03:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
is being
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
excluded this bill is about property
 
03:22:17.469 --> 03:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
rights it's about allowing people to
 
03:22:19.229 --> 03:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
build homes on affordable appropriately
 
03:22:21.309 --> 03:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
sized Lots without being subject to
 
03:22:23.870 --> 03:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
arbitrary excessive regulations that
 
03:22:25.030 --> 03:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
only serve to make housing more
 
03:22:26.870 --> 03:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
expensive and Out Of Reach for too many
 
03:22:30.030 --> 03:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
people and by the way line four of this
 
03:22:33.150 --> 03:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
bill says in a majority of land Zone to
 
03:22:35.830 --> 03:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
permit single family residential uses so
 
03:22:37.349 --> 03:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
I read that as
 
03:22:41.550 --> 03:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
51% so the other 49% of the Town set
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
whatever standards you want we're saying
 
03:22:48.309 --> 03:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
51% minimum LW size under this
 
03:22:51.550 --> 03:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
bill the impacts of these policies are
 
03:22:53.750 --> 03:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
real families arable to find starter
 
03:22:55.870 --> 03:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
homes businesses are struggling to find
 
03:22:57.950 --> 03:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
workers who can afford to live nearby
 
03:22:59.830 --> 03:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
and our local communities are seeing
 
03:23:01.309 --> 03:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
fewer and fewer opportunities for
 
03:23:03.950 --> 03:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
economic growth if we are serious about
 
03:23:06.750 --> 03:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
addressing this crisis and we must be
 
03:23:09.550 --> 03:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
then HP 459 is a crucial step in the
 
03:23:12.429 --> 03:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
right direction I urge you consider the
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
long-term effects of restrictive snob
 
03:23:17.590 --> 03:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
zoning policies it created the crisis
 
03:23:20.229 --> 03:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
we're in now let's not close the door
 
03:23:23.790 --> 03:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
behind us let's pass HB 459 open the
 
03:23:26.309 --> 03:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
door greater opportunity for all thank
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you there any questions from
 
03:23:31.349 --> 03:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
03:23:33.710 --> 03:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr
 
03:23:36.630 --> 03:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you representative
 
03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
Alexander um on the whole this is a very
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
good bill um and I support it and I
 
03:23:47.110 --> 03:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
strongly agree with uh your testimony um
 
03:23:50.189 --> 03:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
I have one problem uh which is the basis
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
of my question um and that has to do
 
03:23:56.910 --> 03:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
with lots serviced by municipal or
 
03:23:58.469 --> 03:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
Community sewer
 
03:24:01.269 --> 03:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um a lot of those lots
 
03:24:03.870 --> 03:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
probably most of them will be in urban
 
03:24:09.269 --> 03:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
areas and um the um minimum lot size
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
allowed uh for that is 22,000 Square ft
 
03:24:14.710 --> 03:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
which as you mentioned comes out to
 
03:24:17.349 --> 03:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
about half an acre uh uh a lot of the
 
03:24:19.229 --> 03:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
houses that are already in such
 
03:24:21.710 --> 03:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods will be on Lots smaller
 
03:24:24.710 --> 03:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
than half an acre think of an urban um
 
03:24:27.950 --> 03:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
area in Manchester in ashaa even in
 
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
conquer uh a lot of the lots of single
 
03:24:32.950 --> 03:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
family houses will be smaller than half
 
03:24:37.269 --> 03:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
an acre so why shouldn't that um minimum
 
03:24:39.990 --> 03:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
lot size that's allowed be not half an
 
03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
acre but a quarter of an acre um
 
03:24:43.990 --> 03:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you very much
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
for your question I think there may be
 
03:24:47.189 --> 03:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that agree with
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
you and I I have not evaluated that yet
 
03:24:52.070 --> 03:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
so I can't take a position but to answer
 
03:24:54.750 --> 03:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
your question line 17 section three of
 
03:24:56.670 --> 03:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
this bill says the requirements in
 
03:24:58.189 --> 03:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
paragraphs 1 and two shall not be
 
03:25:01.309 --> 03:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
construed to limit the pro potential for
 
03:25:03.590 --> 03:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
development on Lots created prior to
 
03:25:06.189 --> 03:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2025 meaning those smaller lots
 
03:25:07.389 --> 03:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
that already
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
exist there's nothing preventing that
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
that those from continuing to be
 
03:25:13.870 --> 03:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
developed as
 
03:25:16.469 --> 03:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
needed sorry followup follow up May
 
03:25:20.670 --> 03:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you um and that's I
 
03:25:22.990 --> 03:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
understand that and that's um that's a
 
03:25:26.830 --> 03:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
good exception um and obviously uh it
 
03:25:29.189 --> 03:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
all always has to be in line with what
 
03:25:31.150 --> 03:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
the sewer the local sewer system will
 
03:25:33.870 --> 03:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
support and I agree with that entirely
 
03:25:37.389 --> 03:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
but say if someone buys a larger lot and
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
wants to split it up into quarter of an
 
03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
acre lots why shouldn't we allow
 
03:25:45.870 --> 03:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
that I I wholeheartedly agree I think
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's a property rights issue and um you
 
03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
know I I take a look at legislative
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
approaches my legislative philosophy is
 
03:25:55.870 --> 03:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
I'd rather take smaller bites of an
 
03:25:59.790 --> 03:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
apple and get get what I we can get then
 
03:26:01.990 --> 03:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
completely like eat the whole Apple at
 
03:26:05.590 --> 03:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
once and um so while I may agree with
 
03:26:08.070 --> 03:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
you personally I think this is a a a
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
modest approach to address the issue
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
that we have right
 
03:26:14.469 --> 03:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
now representative thanks
 
03:26:18.910 --> 03:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
D maybe I miss misunderstood the
 
03:26:22.030 --> 03:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
bill coming off of Representative Gibb's
 
03:26:24.389 --> 03:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
question my understanding of and I only
 
03:26:27.469 --> 03:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
read it online just a few seconds ago uh
 
03:26:28.830 --> 03:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the bill was that
 
03:26:30.990 --> 03:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
what we were doing here was setting a
 
03:26:34.389 --> 03:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
22,000 square foot maximum lot size that
 
03:26:37.030 --> 03:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
could be required in those areas am I
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:41.790 --> 03:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
backwards my my idea was that you
 
03:26:43.830 --> 03:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't maximum yes Max you could you
 
03:26:46.910 --> 03:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't require greater than 22 so you
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
could I use the wrong word you're right
 
03:26:51.910 --> 03:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay so then if if that's the case then
 
03:26:54.189 --> 03:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
I'm that just make sure I got it so it
 
03:26:56.349 --> 03:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
makes all the difference in the world
 
03:26:59.070 --> 03:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
03:27:00.990 --> 03:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
deont do you believe Frontage
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
requirements also pose the same issue
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
and how do you feel that would tie in
 
03:27:07.389 --> 03:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
with this I'm I'm okay entertaining
 
03:27:08.429 --> 03:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
something to deal with Frontage
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
requirements as well if that's what the
 
03:27:09.680 --> 03:27:11.590 align:start position:0%
requirements as well if that's what the
committee

03:27:11.590 --> 03:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:27:14.710 --> 03:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
desires yes representative um along
 
03:27:16.349 --> 03:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
those lines how do you see the is
 
03:27:19.750 --> 03:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
playing out in rural areas and and all
 
03:27:21.189 --> 03:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
by that I'll bring up what do you think
 
03:27:24.429 --> 03:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
this would look like in a conservation
 
03:27:27.910 --> 03:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision um well I I just go back to
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
the line four of the bill that
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
allows it to be zoned in a majority but
 
03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
not all land so I think that that would
 
03:27:40.550 --> 03:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
help cover some a situation like
 
03:27:43.229 --> 03:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
that any other
 
03:27:45.630 --> 03:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:47.710 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

03:27:47.710 --> 03:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:27:54.910 --> 03:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:57.910 --> 03:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
Norwood good good afternoon Mr chair
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:28:01.750 --> 03:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
Chris Norwood and uh I have a handout
 
03:28:03.349 --> 03:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
that I'll leave you all with of just a
 
03:28:06.150 --> 03:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
Q&amp;A that we've prepared so my name is
 
03:28:08.950 --> 03:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
Chris Norwood I'm a real estate broker
 
03:28:10.950 --> 03:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
with a firm at nii Norwood group I
 
03:28:13.229 --> 03:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
reside in the Sea Coast and I am the
 
03:28:15.710 --> 03:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
2025 Vice chair of the New Hampshire
 
03:28:17.349 --> 03:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
Association ation of Realtors public
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
policy committee and our some 7,000
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
members would encourage you to support
 
03:28:25.710 --> 03:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
this bill um shortly in one word it's
 
03:28:28.510 --> 03:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
density uh density is really the key in
 
03:28:31.469 --> 03:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
order for us to build more affordably
 
03:28:34.389 --> 03:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
and we feel that this bill uh in the in
 
03:28:36.030 --> 03:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
the words of Representative Alexander
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
makes a it's a good modest step towards
 
03:28:41.070 --> 03:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
increasing that density um a couple
 
03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
things I'll just leave you with that are
 
03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know my personal experience with lot
 
03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
development and density when I first
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
became a broker in my early 20s I kind
 
03:28:52.349 --> 03:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
of thought naively that uh you know you
 
03:28:55.389 --> 03:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
just take the the number of lot Allowed
 
03:28:58.429 --> 03:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
by uh per acre and you kind of multiply
 
03:28:59.830 --> 03:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
that by the number of Acres of the
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
parcel and then you have your your math
 
03:29:03.349 --> 03:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
figured out that's how many single
 
03:29:04.990 --> 03:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
family homes you can develop or how many
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
apartments you can put on a subject
 
03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
parcel uh representative Dumont I
 
03:29:10.710 --> 03:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
believe you brought up the the question
 
03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
about Road Frontage right there's also
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
Wetland setbacks there's uh slopes right
 
03:29:18.750 --> 03:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
there it's kind of like a game of 3D
 
03:29:22.469 --> 03:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
chess which is why as a naive 20-some I
 
03:29:23.950 --> 03:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
thought I could do this all and then you
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
really realize you do need a soil
 
03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
scientist or a civil engineer to help
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
navigate it's not as simple as just
 
03:29:32.510 --> 03:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
reading the zoning ordinance so I just
 
03:29:34.910 --> 03:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
say that this is one piece of the puzzle
 
03:29:36.389 --> 03:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
there are many other pieces of the
 
03:29:40.349 --> 03:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
puzzle um and this is one piece of it I
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'll also say now 20 some odd years
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
later um I'm in the process of assisting
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
my parents with their home and figuring
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
out exactly what they should do with
 
03:29:54.590 --> 03:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
their land and forgive you some context
 
03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
they have 30 acres of land and their
 
03:29:59.950 --> 03:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
original retirement goal was to build a
 
03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
house a lot in the house in the back on
 
03:30:05.229 --> 03:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
part of the 30 acres and then another
 
03:30:07.070 --> 03:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
lot and a house on the back for my
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
brother and his sister-in-law um and
 
03:30:11.710 --> 03:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
divide off the house that we grew up in
 
03:30:14.110 --> 03:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
so essentially three lots on 30 Acres we
 
03:30:16.189 --> 03:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do it we couldn't do it in
 
03:30:17.750 --> 03:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
the zone that we were in without some
 
03:30:19.950 --> 03:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
sub substantial variances and it had
 
03:30:21.790 --> 03:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
nothing to do by the way with uh Road
 
03:30:25.189 --> 03:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
Frontage it was all about lot size um so
 
03:30:27.790 --> 03:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not here up for this bill because
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to make a material impact for
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
my parents my brother is no longer going
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
to build that house in the back nor are
 
03:30:36.229 --> 03:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
my parents but I say that as an example
 
03:30:38.870 --> 03:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
to illustrate that um sometimes what can
 
03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
be perceived as a kind of right of
 
03:30:43.830 --> 03:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
passage of a property owner to build on
 
03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
their own property or to to bequeath
 
03:30:49.710 --> 03:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
land to their children is unattainable
 
03:30:52.429 --> 03:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
based upon today's current zoning laws
 
03:30:54.030 --> 03:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
so finally there's just a couple things
 
03:30:55.830 --> 03:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill there's a lot of good
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
things that this bill will do and
 
03:30:59.229 --> 03:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
there's some misconceptions about this
 
03:31:01.469 --> 03:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
bill I just want to clear them up it's
 
03:31:04.750 --> 03:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
not going to mandate um you know those
 
03:31:06.990 --> 03:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
maximum Lots you there are in the
 
03:31:10.030 --> 03:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
plurality of land this bill applies to
 
03:31:12.830 --> 03:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
so there's still 49% of the parcels that
 
03:31:16.030 --> 03:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
you could have larger uh lot sizes if if
 
03:31:18.830 --> 03:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
the municipality so chose also there's a
 
03:31:20.910 --> 03:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
misconception I believe surrounding the
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
dees that uh because this is tied to
 
03:31:26.590 --> 03:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety and soil that it would
 
03:31:29.590 --> 03:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of labor for the
 
03:31:31.830 --> 03:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
dees we've been in communication with
 
03:31:34.389 --> 03:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
Dees currently before this bill we
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
believe there will be two touch points
 
03:31:37.790 --> 03:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
when building a septic system on a
 
03:31:40.429 --> 03:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
parcel with Dees after this bill we
 
03:31:41.910 --> 03:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
believe there will be two touch points
 
03:31:44.110 --> 03:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
for building that same septic system and
 
03:31:45.469 --> 03:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
again some of that's outlined in these
 
03:31:45.479 --> 03:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
again some of that's outlined in these
Q&amp;A

03:31:46.790 --> 03:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
Q&amp;A
 
03:31:48.469 --> 03:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
um so we thank you for the opportunity
 
03:31:50.830 --> 03:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
to allow me to testify and happy to
 
03:31:53.150 --> 03:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have thank
 
03:31:55.269 --> 03:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions from the
 
03:31:57.870 --> 03:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you thank
 
03:31:59.389 --> 03:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
03:32:09.510 --> 03:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:11.950 --> 03:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
van thank you Representatives thank you
 
03:32:14.429 --> 03:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
for having me back no place I'd rather
 
03:32:16.349 --> 03:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in favor of this bill
 
03:32:19.950 --> 03:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
and I want to speak in favor of this
 
03:32:21.389 --> 03:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
bill from a slightly different
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
perspective two slightly different
 
03:32:26.349 --> 03:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
perspectives one of them is um the
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
question of the economic health of towns
 
03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest um Town expenditures
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
every year is road maintenance uh I ran
 
03:32:41.550 --> 03:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
the numbers five years ago 5 years ago
 
03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
it cost
 
03:32:47.950 --> 03:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
$465 to maintain one Centerline foot of
 
03:32:51.189 --> 03:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
a town maintained road that numberers CL
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
is over $5 a foot now so when we have
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
large lot
 
03:32:59.389 --> 03:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
sizes we are
 
03:33:04.070 --> 03:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount that that road
 
03:33:06.269 --> 03:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
should be supported by the town by the
 
03:33:08.750 --> 03:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
by the house that faces it so so for
 
03:33:11.710 --> 03:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
example if you have um a lot size that
 
03:33:13.710 --> 03:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
requires 200 ft of Frontage somebody
 
03:33:15.790 --> 03:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
over here asked about Frontage you're in
 
03:33:18.309 --> 03:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
debting your town to for ,000 a year in
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
in road maintenance that house is not
 
03:33:23.070 --> 03:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
paying that much road maintenance the
 
03:33:25.229 --> 03:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
the road budget is usually about 10% of
 
03:33:28.389 --> 03:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
the Town budget um I ran some numbers
 
03:33:31.990 --> 03:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
years ago for a project that was on an
 
03:33:34.510 --> 03:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
acre of land in town in Peterboro New
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a real place you can go
 
03:33:39.790 --> 03:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
look at it uh it's a lot of one acre um
 
03:33:41.630 --> 03:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
it ended up because it had water and
 
03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
sewer it was able to have eight houses
 
03:33:46.469 --> 03:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
on it we had an overlay that allowed
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
that when that parcel was
 
03:33:54.070 --> 03:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
a um parking lot it paid no taxes belong
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
to the Catholic church it was valued at
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
$47,000 that parcel one of those houses
 
03:33:59.920 --> 03:34:00.870 align:start position:0%
$47,000 that parcel one of those houses
just

03:34:00.870 --> 03:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:34:05.389 --> 03:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
sold um just about a week ago for
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
$575,000 so that's a huge amount of tax
 
03:34:13.189 --> 03:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
revenue coming into the town for no more
 
03:34:16.830 --> 03:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
piping Plumbing plowing sanding or
 
03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
ditching than there was when that was a
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
parking lot that's an economic win for
 
03:34:24.189 --> 03:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
the town when we allow places to thicken
 
03:34:27.110 --> 03:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
up like that we improve the economic
 
03:34:30.309 --> 03:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
well-being of our town um reducing lot
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
sizes in places where there is sewer
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is a great way to do that
 
03:34:37.950 --> 03:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
it's a really good way to do that and
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
it's very important for the E economy of
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
the town the other reason that I'm in
 
03:34:45.389 --> 03:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill besides the obvious
 
03:34:47.990 --> 03:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
one should we please have more housing
 
03:34:51.950 --> 03:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
is that as an as a town planner I think
 
03:34:55.790 --> 03:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
a lot about what kind of um a
 
03:34:58.710 --> 03:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
streetscape are we are we creating and
 
03:35:00.309 --> 03:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
when I talk about a streetscape I'm
 
03:35:02.110 --> 03:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
talking about how does it feel to walk
 
03:35:04.830 --> 03:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
down this street and when we have really
 
03:35:08.189 --> 03:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
large Lots first of all you almost never
 
03:35:10.710 --> 03:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
get sidewalks right because it's too
 
03:35:13.630 --> 03:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
long it's too you know it doesn't work
 
03:35:15.150 --> 03:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
so first of all now you got people
 
03:35:16.830 --> 03:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
walking in the Street if they want to
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
walk things are farther apart it makes
 
03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
it harder to make a place the AARP did a
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
survey I think it was three years ago
 
03:35:29.110 --> 03:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
and ask people would they be willing to
 
03:35:31.469 --> 03:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
live in a smaller house if they could
 
03:35:33.189 --> 03:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
live in a walkable neighborhood with
 
03:35:36.030 --> 03:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
amenities and by amenity means I mean a
 
03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
small grocery store a neighborhood bar a
 
03:35:42.670 --> 03:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
coffee shop things like that and 67% of
 
03:35:46.349 --> 03:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
their respondents said they would
 
03:35:50.189 --> 03:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
so having smaller Lots allows us to
 
03:35:53.309 --> 03:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
create more of a neighborhood feel where
 
03:35:55.990 --> 03:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
you can get those neighborhood amenities
 
03:35:58.429 --> 03:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
where it is financially possible to put
 
03:36:01.790 --> 03:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
in sidewalks so for those two reasons
 
03:36:04.510 --> 03:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
the economic health of the town and the
 
03:36:07.070 --> 03:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
social health of the people who live
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
there I would urge you to pass this Bill
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and I'm happy to take
 
03:36:13.510 --> 03:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you there any
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:25.790 --> 03:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
rudderman am I on yes uh good afternoon
 
03:36:31.389 --> 03:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chairman and members of the
 
03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jack rudderman uh I
 
03:36:37.389 --> 03:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
am the legislative affairs advisor at
 
03:36:39.670 --> 03:36:39.680 align:start position:0%

03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
moment so uh appreciate the opportunity
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
to be here to testify today uh I am here
 
03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
in support of HB 459 um as this
 
03:36:59.870 --> 03:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee knows there is no single cause
 
03:37:02.189 --> 03:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
of the acute housing crisis that our
 
03:37:03.269 --> 03:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
state is
 
03:37:05.229 --> 03:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
experiencing and unfortunately there is
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
no Silver Bullet to create enough Supply
 
03:37:10.790 --> 03:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
to meet demand we have a huge shortfall
 
03:37:12.910 --> 03:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
however we do know that one of the root
 
03:37:15.309 --> 03:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
causes of the lack of affordable housing
 
03:37:17.309 --> 03:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
is is local zoning restrictions in
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
particular zoning ordinances requiring
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
excessive minimum lot sizes for single
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
family homes if we are going to increase
 
03:37:27.070 --> 03:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
the supply of new homes particularly
 
03:37:29.469 --> 03:37:29.479 align:start position:0%
starter homes we need to start building
 
03:37:32.110 --> 03:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
on smaller Lots we believe this bill
 
03:37:34.110 --> 03:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
offers a reasonable means of boosting
 
03:37:36.670 --> 03:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
the supply of affordable homes by
 
03:37:38.429 --> 03:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
requiring lot sizing to be tied to
 
03:37:40.750 --> 03:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
environmental standards already in place
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
for Lots not served by Municipal Water
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh and sewer systems and by also
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
establishing a limit on lot sizes for
 
03:37:51.990 --> 03:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
homes on public water and sewer so uh a
 
03:37:53.349 --> 03:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
lot of speakers have already made a lot
 
03:37:55.030 --> 03:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
of great points about this bill I'm not
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to go on any further uh now uh and
 
03:38:00.510 --> 03:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
um just would like to thank the
 
03:38:02.429 --> 03:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
committee for uh your time and
 
03:38:06.030 --> 03:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
consideration and um we would urge you
 
03:38:08.910 --> 03:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
to support this Bill thank you thank you
 
03:38:10.269 --> 03:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the
 
03:38:13.710 --> 03:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr Vice chairman and
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Nick Taylor
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
the director of housing action New
 
03:38:29.630 --> 03:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we're a Statewide advocacy
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
organization that seeks to increase
 
03:38:33.830 --> 03:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
access to housing and we are here in
 
03:38:36.110 --> 03:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
support of this bill um as has been
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned large lot sizes often lead to
 
03:38:40.510 --> 03:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
more expensive homes and make it harder
 
03:38:42.590 --> 03:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
for folks to access home ownership
 
03:38:45.150 --> 03:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
harder for the housing that is necessary
 
03:38:46.950 --> 03:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
for our Workforce for our community so
 
03:38:50.110 --> 03:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
many members of our towns large lot
 
03:38:52.189 --> 03:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
sizes also lead to increased sprawl you
 
03:38:53.510 --> 03:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire is growing our
 
03:38:56.070 --> 03:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
population is living longer and the
 
03:38:58.870 --> 03:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
question is how are we going to develop
 
03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
and when we require two three four acre
 
03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
lots what we are saying is that we are
 
03:39:04.469 --> 03:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
going to develop in a way that increases
 
03:39:06.790 --> 03:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
sprawl and is bad for you know in many
 
03:39:08.229 --> 03:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
respects the conservation and elements
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that so many folks love
 
03:39:12.990 --> 03:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
um a couple points related to some
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
questions that came up earlier around
 
03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
the conservation subdivision this
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't overrule that in any way and in
 
03:39:20.349 --> 03:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
all likelihood most conservation
 
03:39:22.550 --> 03:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
subdivision ordinances already would
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
allow for smaller Lots so if you were
 
03:39:25.510 --> 03:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to go that approach you would
 
03:39:27.309 --> 03:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
probably continue to use your
 
03:39:30.030 --> 03:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities conservation subdivision
 
03:39:31.670 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
same thing goes for the lot siiz
 
03:39:33.550 --> 03:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
question around some of the urban areas
 
03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
it's you know nothing in this would
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
require Manchester NASA conquered areas
 
03:39:39.910 --> 03:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
where you already have those smaller
 
03:39:42.830 --> 03:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
lots to to raise them you know and then
 
03:39:44.590 --> 03:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
they would presumably keep the smaller
 
03:39:47.389 --> 03:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
lot sizes that are already in ordinance
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
um and then there's also a Senate bill
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's attempting to do a similar thing
 
03:39:53.710 --> 03:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
sponsored by Senator Murphy um and there
 
03:39:55.110 --> 03:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
was some conversation around that same
 
03:39:56.910 --> 03:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
question around Frontage and setbacks
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
and if you shrank the lot size but the
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
frontage and the setbacks were all in
 
03:40:02.189 --> 03:40:02.199 align:start position:0%
place you could essentially render the
 
03:40:05.070 --> 03:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
lot unbuildable and so you know I think
 
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's worth thinking about in terms of
 
03:40:09.950 --> 03:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
you know some language that could say
 
03:40:11.550 --> 03:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
nothing and this could allow a
 
03:40:13.309 --> 03:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
municipality to render a lot unbuildable
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
based on additional um restrictions so
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
certainly a good point and things to
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
consider the final thing I will add is
 
03:40:22.349 --> 03:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
that 58 communities in New Hampshire
 
03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
already use some level of soil-based lot
 
03:40:26.950 --> 03:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
sizing when they are determining um
 
03:40:28.349 --> 03:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
residential zones and that's according
 
03:40:30.349 --> 03:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
to Bea's land use survey for
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
municipality so this is not a New
 
03:40:34.750 --> 03:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
Concept it is out there and it is being
 
03:40:36.990 --> 03:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
used by municipalities right now so
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and happy to take any
 
03:40:40.189 --> 03:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
03:40:42.990 --> 03:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you very
 
03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:46.510 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you very
much

03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.520 --> 03:40:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
NCH

03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.309 --> 03:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
GRE thank you Mr chair n gra uh for the
 
03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association the
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce we support
 
03:40:59.790 --> 03:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh we are uh
 
03:41:01.830 --> 03:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
particularly prioritizing legislation
 
03:41:04.550 --> 03:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
that promotes density um this is one of
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
those bills um we uh we believe that
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's important based on what we've
 
03:41:12.910 --> 03:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
heard from industry leaders about how we
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
can lower the cost of housing overall uh
 
03:41:16.870 --> 03:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
I won't repeat anything already said
 
03:41:19.550 --> 03:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
today uh I support all of that um one
 
03:41:22.030 --> 03:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
thing I will add up I will add to the
 
03:41:23.790 --> 03:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
discussion just because it's sometimes
 
03:41:24.870 --> 03:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
becomes a
 
03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
misconception um is the water and sewer
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
and well and septic process um so if you
 
03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
are building a uh a new development
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
where you're putting in uh well uh and
 
03:41:39.790 --> 03:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
septic unit you are already having to go
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
through the state uh Dees permitting
 
03:41:44.670 --> 03:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
process this legislation would not
 
03:41:48.550 --> 03:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
change that that um so if it is the case
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
that you cannot uh actually get a permit
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
for the lot at issue you are not getting
 
03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
a permit and therefore you're not going
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
to be building because no one's going to
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
buy a house without water and sewer um
 
03:42:03.750 --> 03:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
similarly on the uh Public Water and
 
03:42:06.269 --> 03:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
Sewer side of things uh as you go
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
through that process and development uh
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
you have to contact the public uh water
 
03:42:13.389 --> 03:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
and sewer
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
operator uh and actually go through
 
03:42:17.389 --> 03:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
their process to make sure that they
 
03:42:19.870 --> 03:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
have capacity so that's something they
 
03:42:22.590 --> 03:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
already know as plant operators um and I
 
03:42:23.950 --> 03:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
actually think there's actually a pretty
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
good example of how this all played out
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
in New London earlier this year uh there
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
were two uh side by side I believe it
 
03:42:33.469 --> 03:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
was developments um I believe it was the
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
same developer 200 units uh and that
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
ended up stalling because it got
 
03:42:38.790 --> 03:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
approval went through all the local
 
03:42:42.070 --> 03:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
approval processes they were going to
 
03:42:45.550 --> 03:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
put in a I believe first they the idea
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
was to connect it to the public water
 
03:42:49.630 --> 03:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
system as it turned out New London did
 
03:42:51.870 --> 03:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
not have capacity therefore that was
 
03:42:54.030 --> 03:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
denied uh they then said well we'll put
 
03:42:56.429 --> 03:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
in a well it turns out one of the sites
 
03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
had some contamination from uh I believe
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's mtbe uh saw in the paper so again
 
03:43:05.349 --> 03:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
that was denied um Dees is not going to
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
issue a permit for um poisoned water so
 
03:43:11.510 --> 03:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
um that was denied and currently that
 
03:43:13.389 --> 03:43:13.399 align:start position:0%
project is stalled so that just shows
 
03:43:16.110 --> 03:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
how this would play out um um you know
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
were this legislation to pass it
 
03:43:19.910 --> 03:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't Force development where it's
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
not possible have to take any questions
 
03:43:25.189 --> 03:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
that anybody has thank you any questions
 
03:43:27.790 --> 03:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee see none thank you
 
03:43:27.800 --> 03:43:29.630 align:start position:0%
from the committee see none thank you
very

03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:43:37.149 --> 03:43:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
Hatfield good afternoon I'm Meredith
 
03:43:41.630 --> 03:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
Hatfield from The Nature Conservancy um
 
03:43:43.349 --> 03:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have a position on this bill
 
03:43:45.790 --> 03:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to share some thoughts
 
03:43:47.790 --> 03:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
um we are kind of new to housing and we
 
03:43:49.309 --> 03:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
are trying to figure out how we could be
 
03:43:51.630 --> 03:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
helpful uh to the state addressing the
 
03:43:51.640 --> 03:43:52.870 align:start position:0%
helpful uh to the state addressing the
housing

03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:43:55.149 --> 03:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
crisis uh we've been working for about
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
60 years in New Hampshire to protect
 
03:44:00.269 --> 03:44:00.279 align:start position:0%
land and water for people and for
 
03:44:02.670 --> 03:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
animals um we're an employer a small
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
employer so we experience what a lot of
 
03:44:06.349 --> 03:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
other employers do as well that it's
 
03:44:08.229 --> 03:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
hard for people especially young people
 
03:44:10.830 --> 03:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
to find a place to live in New Hampshire
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh we pride ourselves on Partnerships um
 
03:44:15.149 --> 03:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
one that I love to talk about is our
 
03:44:17.590 --> 03:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
partnership with New Hampshire do
 
03:44:21.229 --> 03:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
helping uh with Culvert issues um we've
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of extreme weather lately uh
 
03:44:26.110 --> 03:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
that has not only an impact on roads
 
03:44:28.229 --> 03:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
Bridges and culverts but um from our
 
03:44:29.910 --> 03:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
perspective it also really impacts
 
03:44:32.030 --> 03:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
Wildlife and Fish so we've been able to
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
work with do to come up with uh Creative
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
Solutions including money um to try to
 
03:44:38.670 --> 03:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
rebuild culverts so that they can uh
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
withstand more storms and also be better
 
03:44:45.149 --> 03:44:45.159 align:start position:0%
for animal and fish Passage
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
um as representative Alexander said um
 
03:44:50.269 --> 03:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
as he referred to snob zoning you know
 
03:44:52.830 --> 03:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
we recognize that that often is not very
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
protective of the environment and that
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
it actually can cause sprawl uh habitat
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
fragmentation and perhaps other
 
03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
unintended environmental consequences um
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm really just here to say that we
 
03:45:07.389 --> 03:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
um we work already with a lot of the
 
03:45:09.309 --> 03:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
folks supporting this bill um we're
 
03:45:11.510 --> 03:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
looking to be a partner and to try to
 
03:45:13.229 --> 03:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
figure out how we could
 
03:45:16.349 --> 03:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
bring our science ific knowledge our
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
expertise and the significant mapping
 
03:45:20.990 --> 03:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we've done of the state um showing
 
03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
where important resources exist so that
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
we can try to figure out um where we
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
should be putting the housing that we
 
03:45:30.429 --> 03:45:30.439 align:start position:0%
need thank you thank you there any
 
03:45:33.189 --> 03:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
03:45:34.990 --> 03:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
03:45:41.830 --> 03:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chair my name is
 
03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
Dave Nelson I'm appearing as an
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
individual um although I also have
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
served on the planning board in my U
 
03:45:52.830 --> 03:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
Town for many years and I currently
 
03:45:55.149 --> 03:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
serve as chair but this is my individual
 
03:45:57.630 --> 03:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
contribution there have been a lot of um
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful um points made um and
 
03:46:02.149 --> 03:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
obviously increasing density is going to
 
03:46:05.309 --> 03:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
help make housing more affordable um my
 
03:46:07.229 --> 03:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
only comment with respect to the
 
03:46:10.229 --> 03:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
structure of this current Bild is it's
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
at least in the language seems to focus
 
03:46:15.309 --> 03:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
extensively or almost exclusively on
 
03:46:19.349 --> 03:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
septic designs um it is true that the an
 
03:46:22.149 --> 03:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
HDs will permit a septic design of a
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
certain number of square feet from based
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
on the number of bathrooms and whatnot
 
03:46:28.309 --> 03:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
in in the home but there's more to the
 
03:46:31.149 --> 03:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
size of a lot than simply the area
 
03:46:34.110 --> 03:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
reserved for subsurface um you know
 
03:46:38.269 --> 03:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Disposal um aquifers are one
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
of those things so sewage is important
 
03:46:43.309 --> 03:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
water is is important um but outside of
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
a municipal water District we're talking
 
03:46:48.590 --> 03:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
about aquafers um and that's not an
 
03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
exact science um before the board we
 
03:46:55.389 --> 03:46:55.399 align:start position:0%
have often heard people um suggest that
 
03:46:58.790 --> 03:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
we should decline a um development
 
03:47:01.189 --> 03:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
because anecdotally they have had
 
03:47:02.910 --> 03:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
seasonal you know problems with their
 
03:47:05.229 --> 03:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
well going dry and they want us to
 
03:47:07.790 --> 03:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
guarantee that if we build more houses
 
03:47:09.070 --> 03:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
it won't be a bigger problem and of
 
03:47:11.229 --> 03:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
course we we can't say that so that's
 
03:47:13.510 --> 03:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
one of those pieces of soft science that
 
03:47:15.590 --> 03:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
that comes into the calculus
 
03:47:18.189 --> 03:47:18.199 align:start position:0%
of determining um lot sizes is um
 
03:47:20.950 --> 03:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
aquifers and and and water availability
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
um ledge obviously slopes uh wetlands
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
and so while I I plug the the intent to
 
03:47:31.910 --> 03:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
review um some of the um lands use
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
sizing um I think it needs to consider a
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
bunch of other environmental factors um
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
besides just um septic systems I'll be
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Gibbs
 
03:47:48.590 --> 03:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:47:52.229 --> 03:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
coming to testify this this afternoon um
 
03:47:54.750 --> 03:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
aren't there already limitations on
 
03:47:56.990 --> 03:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
development that would affect
 
03:47:59.670 --> 03:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
Wetlands yeah um there are and and
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
typically um depending on on the local
 
03:48:05.149 --> 03:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
and state um there'll be a setback from
 
03:48:07.550 --> 03:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
a a jurisdictional wet back land
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
there'll be a larger one from a prime
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
Wetland and of course that has to be
 
03:48:13.710 --> 03:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
taken into account um in what is the
 
03:48:20.030 --> 03:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
lot are there any other
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
you is there anybody else here that like
 
03:48:30.510 --> 03:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
to testify on each come on up and just
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
up good afternoon Mr Vice chair members
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my my name is Samuel
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hooper I'm leged of council with the
 
03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
institute for justice we're a nonprofit
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh National civil liberties Law Firm
 
03:48:53.550 --> 03:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
that Advocates among other things for
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
property rights so we do a lot of work
 
03:48:57.670 --> 03:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
on zoning reform also on eminent domain
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
and some other issues like that we are
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
very strongly in support of this bill we
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
think it's excellent that New Hampshire
 
03:49:05.670 --> 03:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
is um kind of being a national leader
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
when it comes to actually looking at how
 
03:49:09.389 --> 03:49:09.399 align:start position:0%
we can tackle the housing crisis as
 
03:49:10.710 --> 03:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
others have said and I won't repeat
 
03:49:12.309 --> 03:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
there is no one Silver Bullet to
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
tackling the housing crisis there are
 
03:49:15.670 --> 03:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
lots of IND individual reforms that need
 
03:49:17.070 --> 03:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
to be made and it's important to not be
 
03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
complacent you know having achieved one
 
03:49:20.950 --> 03:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
thing whether that's reforming adus
 
03:49:23.830 --> 03:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
minimum lot sizes mixed use development
 
03:49:25.149 --> 03:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
that we take our eye off the ball and
 
03:49:27.630 --> 03:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
other things but I think of the various
 
03:49:29.469 --> 03:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
um reforms that we can make uh minimum
 
03:49:31.070 --> 03:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
lot size reform is one of the most
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
important ones for the reasons that
 
03:49:34.630 --> 03:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
others have said in terms of um having
 
03:49:36.630 --> 03:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
greater density means that um
 
03:49:39.389 --> 03:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
communities and um urbanism becomes more
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
sustainable for a town you're not having
 
03:49:43.870 --> 03:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
to um spread um utilities road
 
03:49:45.389 --> 03:49:45.399 align:start position:0%
maintenance and other things over a
 
03:49:47.070 --> 03:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
smaller tax base you know just being
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
able to have that slight increase in
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
density can make a big difference
 
03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
obviously at The Institute for justice
 
03:49:53.110 --> 03:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
we approach syst of property rights
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
perspective as well and something was
 
03:49:56.990 --> 03:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
said that really resonated with me in in
 
03:49:59.149 --> 03:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
support of a previous bill um and and
 
03:50:00.429 --> 03:50:00.439 align:start position:0%
the witness said you know this is not
 
03:50:01.950 --> 03:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
the government's land and that's
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
something that we very much agree with
 
03:50:05.670 --> 03:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
as well you know um there may be places
 
03:50:08.110 --> 03:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
for you know restrictions on land use
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
they should in our opinion be connected
 
03:50:11.630 --> 03:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
to nuisance you know if you're causing
 
03:50:13.990 --> 03:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
actual nuisance in terms of noise um
 
03:50:16.269 --> 03:50:16.279 align:start position:0%
abatement um pollution other issues to
 
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
your neighbors then there can be a place
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
for restrictions but if these
 
03:50:20.990 --> 03:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions are arbitrary if they're
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
related to Aesthetics if they're related
 
03:50:24.750 --> 03:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
to arbitrary minimum lot sizes that
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
aren't connected to a valid health and
 
03:50:28.229 --> 03:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
safety reason then is our view at The
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
Institute for justice that there's
 
03:50:31.469 --> 03:50:31.479 align:start position:0%
probably no place for those restrictions
 
03:50:33.550 --> 03:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
um this bill I think Treads um a very
 
03:50:35.670 --> 03:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
fair path you know allowing A reduced
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size for us for a bare
 
03:50:39.630 --> 03:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
majority of the land and a municipality
 
03:50:42.030 --> 03:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
but still allowing um you know the other
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
half or 49% of the land to retain those
 
03:50:47.429 --> 03:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
larger sizes so we think that that's you
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
know a pragmatic Fair way to begin to do
 
03:50:51.309 --> 03:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
this take an incremental reform that can
 
03:50:53.590 --> 03:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
be beneficial I did want to note as well
 
03:50:55.750 --> 03:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
I did notice um a fiscal note had been
 
03:50:57.790 --> 03:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
attached to the bill I was curious about
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
it because it talked about an
 
03:51:01.630 --> 03:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
indeterminate increase and it mentioned
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
the cost for municipalities in gathering
 
03:51:05.429 --> 03:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
empirical evidence to contest the lot
 
03:51:07.269 --> 03:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
size requirements I was a little
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
perplexed by this I I and I I may be
 
03:51:11.349 --> 03:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with the process here but it
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
seemed as though it was saying that
 
03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
there would be a cost Association with
 
03:51:16.349 --> 03:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
trying to subvert the purpose of the
 
03:51:19.750 --> 03:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill um I'm based in Austin Texas I'm
 
03:51:21.389 --> 03:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
more familiar with the Texas system
 
03:51:22.990 --> 03:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
willough I testify around the country
 
03:51:25.149 --> 03:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
but to me that wouldn't be a valid you
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
know reason to talk about you know this
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
is going to in cause cause additional
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
costs if the only costs are to subvert
 
03:51:32.910 --> 03:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of the bill is to
 
03:51:35.149 --> 03:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
contest the minimum lot size requirement
 
03:51:37.030 --> 03:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
we think um as I say this bill is
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
excellent it's fair um it's pragmatic um
 
03:51:41.469 --> 03:51:41.479 align:start position:0%
it will have benefits in terms of
 
03:51:43.469 --> 03:51:43.479 align:start position:0%
increasing density um Financial
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
sustainability it will be good for
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and it'll be good for
 
03:51:48.550 --> 03:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
property rights as well which is our
 
03:51:50.670 --> 03:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
priority at The Institute for justice um
 
03:51:51.950 --> 03:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
with that thank you very much for
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
hearing me out I'm very happy to take
 
03:51:55.349 --> 03:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you are there any
 
03:51:56.429 --> 03:51:56.439 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:51:59.630 --> 03:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you very much
 
03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else would like to
 
03:52:03.590 --> 03:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
testify yes come on up pass your ping
 
03:52:09.790 --> 03:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:11.950 --> 03:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
please right uh good afternoon Chris
 
03:52:14.229 --> 03:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
Freeman again um I'll keep my comments
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
short because a lot of what I had was
 
03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
already covered by others but um one
 
03:52:21.550 --> 03:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
thing uh when we think about development
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
and the impact of smaller lot sizes um
 
03:52:26.309 --> 03:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
we look at other states that kind of R
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
stamp new developments that you have
 
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
these just acres and Acres of um
 
03:52:33.149 --> 03:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
subdivisions uh one of the things that
 
03:52:34.510 --> 03:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
that they have going for them that we
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't is they are flatland States and um
 
03:52:39.389 --> 03:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have a unique
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
challenge with uh the hilliness of the
 
03:52:43.110 --> 03:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
terrain and the amount of wetlands that
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have and so when looking at this from
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
a conservation perspective being able to
 
03:52:49.469 --> 03:52:49.479 align:start position:0%
take these kind of awkwardly shaped
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
spaces um in between the Peaks and
 
03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
valleys and uh break them up into more
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
usable pieces I think is is huge the
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
number of the amount of development
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's precluded just because you can't
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know you can't turn your
 
03:53:04.469 --> 03:53:04.479 align:start position:0%
spoon-shaped lot or or spoon shaped
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
section of dry land uh into a buildable
 
03:53:10.510 --> 03:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
lot I think is pretty significant
 
03:53:12.910 --> 03:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
um uh another thing I would say is that
 
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
the the density is uh ultimately going
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
to be a benefit to the community in
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
terms of the expansion of the tax base
 
03:53:22.070 --> 03:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
um you know as an investor uh we we'd
 
03:53:23.630 --> 03:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
like to see our taxes go down instead
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
they go up every year and if there was a
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
larger uh built environment for that to
 
03:53:29.429 --> 03:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
be spread over I think that makes
 
03:53:31.229 --> 03:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
business sense uh Mak sense from a
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
public investment perspective um some of
 
03:53:35.550 --> 03:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
the key concerns uh have to do with
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not the infrastructure can
 
03:53:39.469 --> 03:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
fundamentally support uh the development
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I would just like
 
03:53:43.269 --> 03:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
to point out is that development doesn't
 
03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
happen overnight uh and the the sizing
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the existing Water and Sewer
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure was at some point based
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
rationally on the anticipated load that
 
03:53:54.630 --> 03:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
we would be put on those systems and so
 
03:53:56.590 --> 03:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
um just because we've set that that line
 
03:53:58.670 --> 03:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
in the sand at one point in in the past
 
03:54:00.550 --> 03:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we can't move it and
 
03:54:02.389 --> 03:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
put municipalities on notice that as
 
03:54:03.389 --> 03:54:03.399 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about their
 
03:54:06.070 --> 03:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure renewal uh projects that
 
03:54:08.070 --> 03:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
they should be setting larger targets
 
03:54:09.950 --> 03:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
that would promote density and that's
 
03:54:12.750 --> 03:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
all I have thank you there any questions
 
03:54:14.510 --> 03:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much is there
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else that like to
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
testify all right I will close the
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:30.670 --> 03:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
459 recall the chairman and hand the
 
03:54:59.149 --> 03:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
all right it is 153 I would like to open
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB
 
03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
631 and recognize the prime sponsor
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
hble members of the committee for having
 
03:55:17.790 --> 03:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
me back for the record my name is
 
03:55:19.910 --> 03:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
alisandra Murray I represent Hillsboro
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
District 20 which is the town of
 
03:55:26.189 --> 03:55:26.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 9 um so hb631 the bill
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
before you today seeks to address our
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
current housing crisis by allowing for
 
03:55:32.149 --> 03:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
the creation of residential building and
 
03:55:34.349 --> 03:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
mixed residential units within any
 
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
commercial lot whether that be new
 
03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
construction or Rehabilitation of

03:55:43.349 --> 03:55:43.359 align:start position:0%

03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
often defer to local control our housing
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
crisis has reached such a level that we
 
03:55:58.830 --> 03:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
cannot wait for changes to be made
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
incrementally on the local level we need
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
broad sweeping zoning reforms that can
 
03:56:06.309 --> 03:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
start to solve this crisis now according
 
03:56:08.910 --> 03:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
to the 2023 annual homelessness

homelessness Rose in New Hampshire by
 
03:56:16.510 --> 03:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
52% which was the highest increase in
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
the nation surpassing New Mexico New
 
03:56:20.710 --> 03:56:20.720 align:start position:0%

03:56:22.349 --> 03:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
unsheltered people in our state also
 
03:56:25.229 --> 03:56:25.239 align:start position:0%
rose again in 2024 and National experts
 
03:56:27.070 --> 03:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
say that the lack of affordable housing
 
03:56:28.870 --> 03:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
is the number one cause of homelessness
 
03:56:31.149 --> 03:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
in this country according to the
 
03:56:33.229 --> 03:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
National or the New Hampshire realtors
 
03:56:36.070 --> 03:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
association the medium cost for home
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
purchases has increased every single
 
03:56:39.269 --> 03:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
year since
 
03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
1998 the median cost is now at 480k
 
03:56:45.149 --> 03:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
which is a 6.1 rise in cost from just a
 
03:56:48.269 --> 03:56:48.279 align:start position:0%
year ago when the price also Rose by 7%
 
03:56:51.070 --> 03:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
from the year before the median price
 
03:56:52.710 --> 03:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
for a rental unit in New Hampshire
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
reached a record high of, 1691 in 2024
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
moreover as of July 2024 the medium
 
03:57:01.389 --> 03:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
price for a single family had also
 
03:57:04.149 --> 03:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
increased to the highest it's ever been
 
03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
according to Red finin National real
 
03:57:08.469 --> 03:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
estate brokerage nearly a third of all
 
03:57:09.950 --> 03:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
home purchases in the state of New
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2022 were cash only
 
03:57:14.830 --> 03:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
indicating indicating a clear wealth Gap
 
03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
and who can actually afford to purchase
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
a home at this time rental prices have
 
03:57:20.910 --> 03:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
increased at a rapid Pace since the
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
start of covid-19 in 2019 a two-bedroom
 
03:57:24.479 --> 03:57:25.429 align:start position:0%
start of covid-19 in 2019 a two-bedroom
cost

03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:57:28.950 --> 03:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
1347 a month which has increased by
 
03:57:31.750 --> 03:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
31% and I know we all know about the
 
03:57:33.910 --> 03:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
high in crisis but I want to um just
 
03:57:35.349 --> 03:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
continue to share this data for the
 
03:57:37.950 --> 03:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
record um
 
03:57:41.229 --> 03:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
the uh increases have been averaging
 
03:57:43.750 --> 03:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
higher than the increases across the
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
country um specifically in New England
 
03:57:47.790 --> 03:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
and from my own experiences I can tell
 
03:57:49.070 --> 03:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
you that when my husband and I rented
 
03:57:51.110 --> 03:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
our first apartment together a few years
 
03:57:54.710 --> 03:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
ago was a 2.5 bedroom apartment for $900
 
03:57:56.550 --> 03:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
a month and by the time we moved out 5
 
03:57:59.469 --> 03:57:59.479 align:start position:0%
years later it was over $1,600 a month
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
and there had been no renovations or
 
03:58:02.710 --> 03:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
Improvement done to the property in that
 
03:58:05.670 --> 03:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
time renters are more likely to pay more
 
03:58:08.149 --> 03:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
than 30% of their income towards housing
 
03:58:10.990 --> 03:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
costs and nearly half of renters in the
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
Granite State uh declared being burdened
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
by the hous prices among those with a
 
03:58:18.630 --> 03:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
household income less than 35,000 about
 
03:58:20.309 --> 03:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
three out of four were paying more than
 
03:58:23.149 --> 03:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
30% of their income towards rent so the
 
03:58:25.229 --> 03:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
data here is clear the housing crisis is
 
03:58:28.110 --> 03:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
not showing any signs of slowing down
 
03:58:30.510 --> 03:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
and granite Staters are suffering for it
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
we need to take radical action now to
 
03:58:34.349 --> 03:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
stop this problem from getting even
 
03:58:36.429 --> 03:58:36.439 align:start position:0%
worse zoning reforms such as those
 
03:58:38.149 --> 03:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill are an integral
 
03:58:40.030 --> 03:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
part of solving the housing crisis and
 
03:58:42.110 --> 03:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
encouraging new construction which
 
03:58:44.149 --> 03:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
according to the US Commerce Department
 
03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
has significantly slowed in New
 
03:58:47.870 --> 03:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bringing residential units
 
03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
into commercial zones is not only a way
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
to expand the area for potential
 
03:58:53.469 --> 03:58:53.479 align:start position:0%
building but also encourages the kind of
 
03:58:54.910 --> 03:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
building that young people especially
 
03:58:56.910 --> 03:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
want to live in and as we know New
 
03:58:58.389 --> 03:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we currently have a problem
 
03:59:00.149 --> 03:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
retaining young people and workers for
 
03:59:03.070 --> 03:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
our economy that commercial units have
 
03:59:04.710 --> 03:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
been zoned out of existence in older
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and have never been
 
03:59:08.389 --> 03:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
allowed in the first place in newer ones
 
03:59:10.870 --> 03:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
is a real loss for residents kids miss
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
out on opportunities to build
 
03:59:14.429 --> 03:59:14.439 align:start position:0%
Independence people have no choice but
 
03:59:16.030 --> 03:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
to drive to get groceries or anything
 
03:59:17.670 --> 03:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
else they might need even as something
 
03:59:19.389 --> 03:59:19.399 align:start position:0%
as small as a carton of milk and there
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
are fewer opportunities to just bump
 
03:59:22.630 --> 03:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
into people you know and actually be
 
03:59:25.030 --> 03:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
able to build community where you live
 
03:59:26.990 --> 03:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
these might seem like little things but
 
03:59:28.990 --> 03:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
collectively they make life harder more
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
expensive and more isolating imagine how
 
03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
many thriving home businesses there
 
03:59:35.149 --> 03:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
could be if we actually encourage people
 
03:59:37.389 --> 03:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
to go make them rather than creating as
 
03:59:40.030 --> 03:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
much red tape as possible if we mix
 
03:59:41.590 --> 03:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
commercial and residential zones we
 
03:59:43.229 --> 03:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
lower the need for parking minimums
 
03:59:45.070 --> 03:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
encourage walkability and create the
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
kind of communities our state needs to
 
03:59:48.670 --> 03:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
thrive I'll be happy to take any
 
03:59:50.229 --> 03:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
03:59:52.149 --> 03:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
Murray I have two okay so um page
 
03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
two line 18 section four municipality
 
04:00:01.510 --> 04:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
provided paragraph 2 may require up to
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
20% of available ground FL space be
 
04:00:06.149 --> 04:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
dedicated to residential uses are you
 
04:00:08.229 --> 04:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to raising that I feel like 20%
 
04:00:09.309 --> 04:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
for ground
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
floor is a little like unreasonable
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
maybe they could require up to 70% or
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
80% because the idea is is if you want
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
to build a walkable neighborhood you can
 
04:00:22.990 --> 04:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
have the the shops on the ground floor
 
04:00:24.349 --> 04:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
and then have the apartments above
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
that's the way I picture it um yeah I
 
04:00:27.510 --> 04:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely I was wondering where you got
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
the 20% that's um I worked with um
 
04:00:32.550 --> 04:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
someone on uh the language of the bill
 
04:00:34.030 --> 04:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
housing Advocate but I would be happy to
 
04:00:35.710 --> 04:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
make any changes and I completely agree
 
04:00:36.670 --> 04:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
with you we've seen that kind of
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
building do very well in Bedford and
 
04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
Salem where they're building these units
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
above um Sephora and the gym which is
 
04:00:43.680 --> 04:00:44.830 align:start position:0%
above um Sephora and the gym which is
great

04:00:44.830 --> 04:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:00:46.349 --> 04:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
I don't go to
 
04:00:48.830 --> 04:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
Sephora so
 
04:00:55.070 --> 04:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
um um and also line 20 through
 
04:00:57.870 --> 04:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
203 it says that the municipality may
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
require the development include on-site
 
04:01:03.469 --> 04:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
vehicle proper vehicle parking but the
 
04:01:04.950 --> 04:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
property owner shall have full authority
 
04:01:06.630 --> 04:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
to determine the location and size of
 
04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
the parking lot for
 
04:01:11.670 --> 04:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
residents doesn't that just like cancel
 
04:01:14.269 --> 04:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
it out because won't the property owner
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
build the pro build the amount of
 
04:01:17.110 --> 04:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
parking needed for the development
 
04:01:19.870 --> 04:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
anyways and so the town can say oh you
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
need parking and the property owner if
 
04:01:23.229 --> 04:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
they don't want parking they can like do
 
04:01:26.429 --> 04:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
one spot you know I I I guess I don't I
 
04:01:28.590 --> 04:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
don't see the purpose of that section if
 
04:01:30.830 --> 04:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
if there's something I'm missing let me
 
04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
know but again if you're okay with it
 
04:01:35.590 --> 04:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
scratching that section like your
 
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
feedback be happy to scratch it I think
 
04:01:41.389 --> 04:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's just trying to keep in line with um
 
04:01:43.229 --> 04:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that this bill wouldn't change
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
any exist ing regulations that the
 
04:01:47.710 --> 04:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities may have already for
 
04:01:49.469 --> 04:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
these commercial zones so if they
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
already have parking restrictions for
 
04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
these commercial zones that those would
 
04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
still apply in the Residential Building
 
04:01:58.149 --> 04:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's just kind of aligning
 
04:01:59.670 --> 04:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
it with that but if you think the bill
 
04:02:01.710 --> 04:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
could be simplified by removing that
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
happy to great thank you representative
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you Mr chairman I'm just I'm
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
just curious if you could provide a
 
04:02:14.910 --> 04:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
little context for your decision
 
04:02:17.830 --> 04:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
um in terms of in terms of the
 
04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities that would be
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
impacted to align it with the urban area
 
04:02:25.790 --> 04:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
designation by the US Census Bureau I
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
mean I think um you know when I when I
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
saw the title of this bill and then I
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
dug deeper you know I started realizing
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
that the communities I assumed would be
 
04:02:39.070 --> 04:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
targeted it was a lot more communities
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
than that you know communities we might
 
04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
not think of as Urban places like
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
Meredith or Lincoln or these other
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities um that are really truly
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
pretty rural places so I'm just curious
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
about your decision to use that
 
04:02:54.110 --> 04:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
designation and and if you could provide
 
04:02:55.710 --> 04:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
us some assistance and understanding
 
04:02:58.149 --> 04:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
your logic there yeah I think you know
 
04:02:59.910 --> 04:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
the intent is
 
04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
to work in places where the
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities are more prepared to deal
 
04:03:07.950 --> 04:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
with like a potential increase in um
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
that amount of building and the amount
 
04:03:10.830 --> 04:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
of people that would be like residing in
 
04:03:14.750 --> 04:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
such a mixed use um building um and to
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
take into consideration you know what
 
04:03:18.349 --> 04:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
I've heard from some more rural counties
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
about what they would actually be
 
04:03:23.070 --> 04:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
willing to um explore but again if
 
04:03:24.269 --> 04:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
that's something the committee would
 
04:03:25.469 --> 04:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
rather just open up to all
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities I'm I'm happy to do
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
so any other questions thank you
 
04:03:34.189 --> 04:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much um
 
04:03:35.149 --> 04:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
chair would like to call on Matt
 
04:03:35.159 --> 04:03:44.389 align:start position:0%
chair would like to call on Matt
Mayberry

04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:44.399 --> 04:03:45.670 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:03:47.830 --> 04:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon once again
 
04:03:49.790 --> 04:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
chairman committee members my name is
 
04:03:51.510 --> 04:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
Matt Mayberry I'm the CEO of the New
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm asking you to give
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
pause on this
 
04:04:04.149 --> 04:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
bill because here are some of our
 
04:04:05.550 --> 04:04:05.560 align:start position:0%
concerns from a homeb building
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
perspective and a provider of housing
 
04:04:10.510 --> 04:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
that we as a state as we are tackling
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
these housing issues we will conquer
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
them We Will Conquer this
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
challenge but we also want to make sure
 
04:04:20.830 --> 04:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
that those newly housed individuals have
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
a place to work so they can afford those
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
mortgages and afford those
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
rents the way the bill is written is
 
04:04:34.149 --> 04:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
pretty with the broad definition of
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
commercial that could be commercial that
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
could be retail that could be
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that could be
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
biotech anywhere in there
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
because I can promise you right now
 
04:04:49.389 --> 04:04:49.399 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen that if you open up
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
all commercially zoned land for
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
residential use by right then you're
 
04:04:56.349 --> 04:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
going to see a Scramble for Builders to
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
pick up industrial parks technology
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
Parks every strip mall in New Hampshire
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
these buildings are not the easiest to
 
04:05:06.830 --> 04:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
finance as they are when you add a
 
04:05:09.550 --> 04:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
residential component to it it could
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
make getting financing
 
04:05:15.070 --> 04:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
harder often why do after 35 years of
 
04:05:16.910 --> 04:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
being a real estate agent and real
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
estate broker is I'll counsel
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
individuals that if you have a multif
 
04:05:22.950 --> 04:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
family building you can Kindom minimize
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
them and sell them
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
individually if you have a commercial
 
04:05:30.510 --> 04:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
retail or industrial presence on the
 
04:05:32.590 --> 04:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
first floor even the first two floors
 
04:05:34.590 --> 04:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
even office
 
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
space to get financing for the
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
residential units above sold as
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
individual Condominiums will be nearly
 
04:05:41.359 --> 04:05:44.670 align:start position:0%
individual Condominiums will be nearly
impossible

04:05:44.670 --> 04:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.149 --> 04:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
you'll have some investors who will jump
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
in there but the folks who I think
 
04:05:50.429 --> 04:05:50.439 align:start position:0%
you're trying to help will be priced out
 
04:05:52.590 --> 04:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
of it because they have that come with
 
04:05:56.670 --> 04:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
100% down or a sizable down payment in
 
04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
order to get that and it'll be certain
 
04:06:00.630 --> 04:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
covenants to go with
 
04:06:03.670 --> 04:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
that if if municipalities wanted this
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
type of De development all they have to
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
do is just change it the rezoning to
 
04:06:07.600 --> 04:06:09.630 align:start position:0%
do is just change it the rezoning to
mixed

04:06:09.630 --> 04:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
mixed
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
use if the language in the bill narrowed
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
the definition commercial to
 
04:06:19.349 --> 04:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
retail with retail or office on the
 
04:06:19.359 --> 04:06:20.590 align:start position:0%
retail with retail or office on the
first

04:06:20.590 --> 04:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:06:24.990 --> 04:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
floor and Resident above we'd support
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
that I personally am
 
04:06:31.590 --> 04:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself I'm a member of the
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
Rochester New Hampshire Economic
 
04:06:35.950 --> 04:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
Development um
 
04:06:38.070 --> 04:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee we talk to folks who want to
 
04:06:40.870 --> 04:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
come to straford County to build bring
 
04:06:44.229 --> 04:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
jobs they're asking two questions where
 
04:06:47.710 --> 04:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
can we build our manufacturing plant and
 
04:06:50.349 --> 04:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
what does our Workforce look
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
like we really don't want to have
 
04:06:56.269 --> 04:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
residential units inside industrial
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
parks and that's where we're fearful
 
04:06:59.910 --> 04:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
this is we may
 
04:07:02.349 --> 04:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
go um I understand the immediate need
 
04:07:04.870 --> 04:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
for housing residential housing I live
 
04:07:08.670 --> 04:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
it 70 hours a week but 84% of our land
 
04:07:11.469 --> 04:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
is forested and a total of 52% of New
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is protected under current use
 
04:07:13.040 --> 04:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is protected under current use
statute

04:07:14.309 --> 04:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:07:16.030 --> 04:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
so maybe we should be looking elsewhere
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
other than Industrial and Commercial
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
parks and strip malls to build
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
housing thank
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
you questions for Mr Mayberry
 
04:07:26.479 --> 04:07:27.950 align:start position:0%
you questions for Mr Mayberry
representative

04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr shair and thank you
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify this afternoon yes
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
ma'am um You' stated your major concern
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
being about the difficulty of financing
 
04:07:41.590 --> 04:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
in certain uh circumstances but since
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature does not have the power
 
04:07:47.109 --> 04:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
to set financing standards shouldn't we
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
concern ourselves as we do in this bill
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
with loosening the uh government and
 
04:07:55.349 --> 04:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
Municipal regulations that we can
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
control and thereby allowing more
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
housing even if it won't be built in
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
every area that this bill would allow it
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
will still be built in more areas
 
04:08:08.670 --> 04:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we concern ourselves with that
 
04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
it's all a matter of perspective ma'am
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
that we're a culmination of our life
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
experiences and we don't
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
compartmentalize when you walk in that
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
door and when you sit behind that
 
04:08:23.870 --> 04:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
microphone we are a product of our
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
experiences and we're trying to bring in
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing here we're trying to bring
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
in more high-tech we all applaud what's
 
04:08:35.710 --> 04:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
going on in Manchester in the
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
Mills but when you look at some of the
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
industrial parks and Commercial parks
 
04:08:42.269 --> 04:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
and Manufacturing do you really want a
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
also those are questions that you folks
 
04:08:49.269 --> 04:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
have to ask
 
04:08:51.149 --> 04:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
yourselves I'm just asking you to give
 
04:08:55.870 --> 04:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
pause to the broad definition of
 
04:08:59.830 --> 04:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
commercial maybe a little
 
04:09:02.149 --> 04:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
narrower represent
 
04:09:04.590 --> 04:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:09:07.309 --> 04:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question there's a few pieces
 
04:09:07.319 --> 04:09:08.830 align:start position:0%
taking my question there's a few pieces
here

04:09:08.830 --> 04:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so as has been testified to by
 
04:09:16.030 --> 04:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
variety of people including yourself um
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
a big piece I I disagree with many
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
people I don't think the only piece or
 
04:09:22.830 --> 04:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
maybe even necessarily the largest piece
 
04:09:24.670 --> 04:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
of solving the housing crisis is Supply
 
04:09:27.269 --> 04:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
but a certainly a big piece and I I'm
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
having a hard time understanding why you
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
would on other bills say that we need to
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
increase Supply we need to increase
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
Supply but on this one opening up areas
 
04:09:38.349 --> 04:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
and I want to be specific because I hear
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
you talking about residential
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
development as in creating residential
 
04:09:46.229 --> 04:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
buildings and what I understand and I'm
 
04:09:48.790 --> 04:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I will freely admit if I've missed
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
something in this bill is residential
 
04:09:54.910 --> 04:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
use of a commercial building so if
 
04:09:56.870 --> 04:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a space above a commercial
 
04:09:58.990 --> 04:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
building that can be rented out but not
 
04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
building a residential building in a
 
04:10:03.469 --> 04:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
commercial Zone that's not how I read
 
04:10:06.030 --> 04:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
this so I don't understand why not if
 
04:10:08.309 --> 04:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
Supply is the answer as has been
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
testified to repeatedly over and over
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
again why is not opening areas that make
 
04:10:14.950 --> 04:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
no sense to deny people the right to
 
04:10:18.870 --> 04:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
just sleep there why is that not
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
helping because to have a stable
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
tax-based representative you must have a
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
residential component and have that
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
offset by retail commercial office
 
04:10:31.710 --> 04:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
technology communities have found that
 
04:10:35.229 --> 04:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
if you live just on the backs of
 
04:10:38.189 --> 04:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
residential property taxes they have
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
some of the highest taxes in the
 
04:10:44.030 --> 04:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
state when you look at communities like
 
04:10:46.950 --> 04:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
Newington and I think they're at like $9
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
per assess thousand now because they
 
04:10:51.389 --> 04:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
have a large retail commercial
 
04:10:55.429 --> 04:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
there are you done answering the
 
04:10:58.590 --> 04:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
question Mr
 
04:11:02.910 --> 04:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
GRE so if I'm hearing you right that
 
04:11:09.750 --> 04:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's not anything to do with like the
 
04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
safety of the people who would be living
 
04:11:14.109 --> 04:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
in in a commercial Zone or anything like
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
that it's literally the difficulties
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
around taxes in a in the face of a
 
04:11:20.590 --> 04:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
housing crisis where we are desperately
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure people have a place
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
to stay so they aren't forced out either
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
into the cold or into a out of the state
 
04:11:30.030 --> 04:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
um that we just haven't figured out the
 
04:11:32.830 --> 04:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
proper tax structure but isn't that a
 
04:11:34.269 --> 04:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
secondary thing to figure out and
 
04:11:35.710 --> 04:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the towns figure out how to
 
04:11:37.389 --> 04:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
deal with that after the fact I mean
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
isn't it of primary importance to figure
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
out how do we Supply housing
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not not really sure
 
04:11:46.590 --> 04:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
how that relates to his testimony in so
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
far as Mr Mayberry has said that he is
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
not against the premise of the bill but
 
04:11:53.309 --> 04:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
would like to see the definition of
 
04:11:55.149 --> 04:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
commercial narrowed down and I think
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
you're going away from the germanness of
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
what his testimony was covering I am
 
04:12:01.269 --> 04:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
directly responding to his last answer
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
to my last question which is I said why
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this why would this be an issue
 
04:12:07.550 --> 04:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm reading it differently and
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
he said because the tax so I'm saying
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
isn't tax a secondary concern next to
 
04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
the prim concern making sure and I'm
 
04:12:17.550 --> 04:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
asking for him if that's his
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
opinion a representative we're going to
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
solve this challenge together we're
 
04:12:25.309 --> 04:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
going to bring more housing online we
 
04:12:27.870 --> 04:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
must pick our heads up and look what our
 
04:12:29.590 --> 04:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
state is going to look like 20 years
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
down the
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
road what type of tax base do you want
 
04:12:37.710 --> 04:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
your tenants and your employees to be
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
living under if we only do this just on
 
04:12:42.910 --> 04:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
the backs of housing we're going to be
 
04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
back here 15 years from now saying we
 
04:12:47.469 --> 04:12:47.479 align:start position:0%
need property tax relief because we took
 
04:12:49.389 --> 04:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
all of our industrial parks and we made
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
them housing
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
developments I can guarantee you my
 
04:12:56.109 --> 04:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
Builders will be in line to buy all of
 
04:12:59.070 --> 04:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
them let the auction
 
04:13:01.630 --> 04:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
begin but then 20 years down the road
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
when they're living in Florida and
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
Texas this legisl is going be faced with
 
04:13:09.790 --> 04:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
what do we do because we can't bring in
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
any more Lonas any more army any more of
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
the industrial base that we
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
want here
 
04:13:21.469 --> 04:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturing where does hitchner go
 
04:13:23.670 --> 04:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
when we take the land AB budding them
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
and we put a Housing Development on it
 
04:13:27.990 --> 04:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
all I'm asking you to do is perhaps
 
04:13:31.229 --> 04:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
narrow this down to retail and office
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
that makes sense your employees can live
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
on the second third and fourth floors go
 
04:13:39.149 --> 04:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
downstairs to work go to work in the
 
04:13:41.149 --> 04:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
office why do they need to be next to
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
chair um you mentioned that um the home
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
buildings will be in line to purchase
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
the B the Lots where there are
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
industrial parks but wouldn't the
 
04:14:04.590 --> 04:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
industrial park owners uh only sell if
 
04:14:07.630 --> 04:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
that were more profitable than creating
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
industry in those industrial parks if
 
04:14:11.469 --> 04:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
there was already an industrial park
 
04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
with industry in it wouldn't they keep
 
04:14:14.950 --> 04:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
it if that were more
 
04:14:17.469 --> 04:14:17.479 align:start position:0%
profitable most industrial parks are
 
04:14:19.830 --> 04:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
owned by municipalities and there are
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
two little words in this that changes
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
everything by
 
04:14:28.830 --> 04:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
right so a town planning board or town
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
zoning board can say we want some mixed
 
04:14:33.990 --> 04:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
juice over here that'd be great that's
 
04:14:35.710 --> 04:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate for our
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
municipality they should be able to do
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
that but when you add the words by right
 
04:14:41.910 --> 04:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
you take away the options from the
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
municipality to say what their town will
 
04:14:48.189 --> 04:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
look like and say we don't care there's
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
an industrial park and there's a 40 acre
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
parcel on there we can put 80
 
04:14:58.269 --> 04:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:58.279 --> 04:15:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
there

04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:15:03.790 --> 04:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh would this bill Force anyone
 
04:15:06.269 --> 04:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
including a municipality to sell an
 
04:15:08.590 --> 04:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
industrial park to a home builder I
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
don't see that it does but the but
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative the two key words in
 
04:15:17.070 --> 04:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
there are by right but would that force
 
04:15:17.080 --> 04:15:18.389 align:start position:0%
there are by right but would that force
a

04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
sale a buyer and seller don't have to
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
agree to anything because I can walk up
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
to you and say I'll buy your home for
 
04:15:28.830 --> 04:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
$10 by right I can do that you don't
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
have to do it no one has to buy no one
 
04:15:33.750 --> 04:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:37.229 --> 04:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
sell but when you have that you know
 
04:15:40.109 --> 04:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
residential overlay by
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
right and then you take it to town
 
04:15:42.239 --> 04:15:43.429 align:start position:0%
right and then you take it to town
meeting

04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
and town me says yes we'll sell those
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
150 acres even though we'd love to have
 
04:15:50.510 --> 04:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
a microchip plant in there like they're
 
04:15:52.349 --> 04:15:52.359 align:start position:0%
doing in Charlestown New Hampshire right
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
now $64
 
04:15:59.910 --> 04:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I I
 
04:16:06.910 --> 04:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
think I I has he answered your question
 
04:16:09.870 --> 04:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
no one more one more followup all right
 
04:16:14.349 --> 04:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.149 --> 04:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
does the term by right Force the
 
04:16:21.429 --> 04:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
municipality to sell or does it only say
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
that if the land is already
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
available can the housing be built on it
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
I would argue with the
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
letter okay
 
04:16:39.309 --> 04:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
um not a question I have a
 
04:16:43.030 --> 04:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
question line 18 on page two what what
 
04:16:45.389 --> 04:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
you're saying to me is that you would be
 
04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
in favor of a bill like this if we
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
raised the percentage up to 100% on
 
04:16:53.830 --> 04:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
ground level and excluded it solely to
 
04:16:57.269 --> 04:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
retail and um what was it ret office
 
04:16:59.469 --> 04:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
retail and office and it could also be
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
medical office and removing the parking
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
requirement that I'm sure the home
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
builders have testified and support of
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
doing that before too yes sir okay thank
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
you questions for Mr B representative
 
04:17:18.510 --> 04:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
buio thank you Mr chairman um so well
 
04:17:19.630 --> 04:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
because I I I really actually like the
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
idea of this bill um you know we do too
 
04:17:26.950 --> 04:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
so I you know I want to see something
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know like this happen and it's
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
actually kind of ironic that you
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh hitchner because you know
 
04:17:32.870 --> 04:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
in my district includes Littleton New
 
04:17:33.990 --> 04:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that used to have a hitchner
 
04:17:36.030 --> 04:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing plant and is now currently
 
04:17:37.870 --> 04:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
a mixed use development with uh
 
04:17:40.109 --> 04:17:40.119 align:start position:0%
commercial and residential and it got
 
04:17:42.030 --> 04:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
rezoned as mixed use in order to allow
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
that to happen but that was quite an
 
04:17:45.510 --> 04:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
ordeal and my town also has an
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
industrial park that was specifically
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
cited because it has the infrastructure
 
04:17:51.389 --> 04:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
and everything needed for all of those
 
04:17:53.070 --> 04:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers which is actually kind of
 
04:17:54.750 --> 04:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
hard to put together in some places so
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's very deliberately chosen so I guess
 
04:18:01.469 --> 04:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
my question is I know um the chair uh
 
04:18:03.070 --> 04:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
chairman was just talking about page two
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
line 18 but on page one line 27 it says
 
04:18:09.870 --> 04:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
is located on a parcel zone for
 
04:18:12.990 --> 04:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
commercial office retail or parking uses
 
04:18:15.389 --> 04:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
um you know retail office I mean for
 
04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
mixed use definitely makes sense but
 
04:18:19.630 --> 04:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
nobody wants I mean well if you didn't
 
04:18:20.830 --> 04:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
have a choice I do agree with
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
representative Reed on that you know
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
housing is housing but I don't think
 
04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
most people if they had a choice would
 
04:18:27.710 --> 04:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
choose to live on top of like a working
 
04:18:30.109 --> 04:18:30.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturing plant um if they could
 
04:18:32.429 --> 04:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
help it so would it would it help then
 
04:18:34.349 --> 04:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
because there's earlier definitions in
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
this bill if it defined maybe what
 
04:18:39.030 --> 04:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
commercial office retail or parking uses
 
04:18:41.149 --> 04:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
were cuz when I first read this I didn't
 
04:18:43.149 --> 04:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
read industrial at all I didn't think
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
that this would in any way allow people
 
04:18:46.750 --> 04:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
to build anything in an industrial park
 
04:18:50.349 --> 04:18:50.359 align:start position:0%
so is it a lack of definition or is it
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
just something else I'm missing sorry
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
for the long-windedness in our in our
 
04:18:58.229 --> 04:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
view sir it was the lack of definition
 
04:19:02.109 --> 04:19:02.119 align:start position:0%
because a commercial grade property is
 
04:19:05.349 --> 04:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
five residential units or above a truck
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
stop is a commercial grade property a
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
supermarket is a commercial gr
 
04:19:13.950 --> 04:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
property so with without the definition
 
04:19:21.149 --> 04:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
is that that leaves it a lot very open
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
to interpretation that was our only
 
04:19:27.870 --> 04:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
challenge that's why I I didn't say no I
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
didn't say yes I just ask for you to
 
04:19:33.030 --> 04:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
pause and please consider a def a
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
refinement of the word commercial please
 
04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:39.119 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
miles thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um if we can
 
04:19:46.109 --> 04:19:46.119 align:start position:0%
go back to the piece about the the the
 
04:19:49.389 --> 04:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
tax part um if you could just clarify
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
are you just saying that if we only have
 
04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
residential buildings in our towns we
 
04:19:59.950 --> 04:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
only build residential and we foro any
 
04:20:03.149 --> 04:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
other commercial stores retail the
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
people who live in the town and 15 20
 
04:20:09.149 --> 04:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
years down the road the people who are
 
04:20:12.269 --> 04:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
trying to keep that town intact their
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
property taxes will have skyrocketed
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
because there will be no Industries
 
04:20:19.149 --> 04:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
bringing money into the town and it will
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
be solely on the backs of the property
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
owners yes and no and I want to make
 
04:20:27.389 --> 04:20:27.399 align:start position:0%
sure that I heard it correctly that you
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
know without Actuarial tables nor my
 
04:20:30.600 --> 04:20:31.550 align:start position:0%
know without Actuarial tables nor my
crystal

04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
crystal
 
04:20:34.590 --> 04:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
ball but when you look at municipalities
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
around our
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
state those who rely solely on property
 
04:20:39.479 --> 04:20:40.750 align:start position:0%
state those who rely solely on property
tax

04:20:40.750 --> 04:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
revenue tend to have high higher
 
04:20:45.870 --> 04:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
property tax bills than those that may
 
04:20:48.670 --> 04:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
be offset by some other factors now
 
04:20:51.389 --> 04:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
there's always exceptions to the
 
04:20:51.399 --> 04:20:53.349 align:start position:0%
there's always exceptions to the
rules

04:20:53.349 --> 04:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:20:55.790 --> 04:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
um of course my
 
04:21:02.830 --> 04:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:02.840 --> 04:21:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
Reed

04:21:04.910 --> 04:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
Reed
 
04:21:08.590 --> 04:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
I'm so I I guess I'm still struggling to
 
04:21:12.349 --> 04:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
understand this tax uh argument because
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
if if you have a commercial Zone and
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
you're allowing residential use you're
 
04:21:17.710 --> 04:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
allowing someone to live in it it may
 
04:21:19.109 --> 04:21:19.119 align:start position:0%
not be the whole building it may be just
 
04:21:20.830 --> 04:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
the top it may be a piece it may be the
 
04:21:23.469 --> 04:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
whole building but the assessment of
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
that property is still the property the
 
04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
size the amenities of the property the
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
assessment the value of the property as
 
04:21:32.950 --> 04:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
a commercially zoned structure that's
 
04:21:35.550 --> 04:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
the assessment that's what it gets taxed
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
on so I'm not perhaps you would
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
enlighten me as to why I mean I
 
04:21:43.189 --> 04:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying that if 's no
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
industry but you're just talking about
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
property tax and property tax is based
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
on the assessment which includes the
 
04:21:50.189 --> 04:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
actual structure the value of the
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
structure including when things are
 
04:21:55.710 --> 04:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
commercially zoned they are worth more
 
04:21:58.030 --> 04:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
so where where is the town losing
 
04:21:59.469 --> 04:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
Revenue if it's a commercially Zone
 
04:22:01.510 --> 04:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
you're just allowing an extra use you're
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
not changing the zoning you're not
 
04:22:06.189 --> 04:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.189 --> 04:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
structure basically just letting people
 
04:22:08.199 --> 04:22:09.670 align:start position:0%
structure basically just letting people
sleep

04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
sleep
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
there unfortunately life is as
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
complicated as just just going to bed
 
04:22:15.710 --> 04:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
and waking up that you have to pay for
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
that somehow and all I'm suggesting is
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
at please get out of North Main Street
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
here in
 
04:22:30.309 --> 04:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
conquer and head out to an industrial
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
park if this goes through by right you
 
04:22:34.399 --> 04:22:36.189 align:start position:0%
park if this goes through by right you
could

04:22:36.189 --> 04:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
have a clothing
 
04:22:43.149 --> 04:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer a 20 unit apart
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
building and you could have a medical
 
04:22:45.720 --> 04:22:46.910 align:start position:0%
building and you could have a medical
research

04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
research
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
facility all on the same
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
street because it it's a commercial
 
04:22:51.680 --> 04:22:52.750 align:start position:0%
street because it it's a commercial
grade

04:22:52.750 --> 04:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
grade
 
04:22:54.870 --> 04:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
property and all and all I'm saying
 
04:22:58.109 --> 04:22:58.119 align:start position:0%
representative is that you
 
04:23:01.109 --> 04:23:01.119 align:start position:0%
know look 20 years down the road of how
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
do we want our tax
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
base we're going to work through this
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
housing challenge we're going to provide
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
housing we're going to do this you folks
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
have been very diligent the Chairman's
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
been very diligent he and I speak more
 
04:23:14.670 --> 04:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
than I think he speaks to his
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
parents because he is on this every
 
04:23:21.229 --> 04:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
single day I promise
 
04:23:24.670 --> 04:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:23:26.990 --> 04:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr jiren thank you for
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
answering taking my question again um I
 
04:23:32.030 --> 04:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
mean this is the second time I asked a
 
04:23:34.030 --> 04:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
question and your answer really I don't
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
think addressed the actual question but
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
you said we are going to build the
 
04:23:40.189 --> 04:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
housing now you represent the Builder
 
04:23:42.429 --> 04:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
Association so are you saying that BAS
 
04:23:45.189 --> 04:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
basically we meaning you all you want to
 
04:23:46.750 --> 04:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
build the housing and not allow
 
04:23:48.189 --> 04:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
currently existing structures that are
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
zoned commercially to provide any of
 
04:23:52.990 --> 04:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
that housing because then you would have
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
a more Demand on your service that you
 
04:23:59.229 --> 04:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
provide right if we're providing housing
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
on the in the existing commercial
 
04:24:01.790 --> 04:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
structures then all of a sudden that's a
 
04:24:03.630 --> 04:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
less Demand on you all building housing
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
so is that what I'm hearing you say
 
04:24:06.670 --> 04:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
because that sounds a lot like what
 
04:24:07.870 --> 04:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
you've been
 
04:24:10.830 --> 04:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
arguing we we want your tenants and your
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
constituents to have a place to
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.469 --> 04:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
think representative
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr
 
04:24:24.870 --> 04:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
chair um while I don't think that the
 
04:24:27.269 --> 04:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
term buy right requires anybody to sell
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
anything um uh I find that I cannot find
 
04:24:34.630 --> 04:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
the term by right in the bill itself um
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
I find it in the analysis which is
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
basically a summary and description can
 
04:24:41.229 --> 04:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
you tell me um where in the bill the
 
04:24:43.229 --> 04:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
term by right is
 
04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
down I'd be happy excuse me I'd be happy
 
04:24:48.750 --> 04:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
to take a look at that and I'll send it
 
04:24:49.550 --> 04:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
to you I don't want to take the
 
04:24:51.510 --> 04:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee's time trying to reread the
 
04:24:54.149 --> 04:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
bill for the fourth time uh to find two
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
words I'm happy to do so but if you have
 
04:25:01.109 --> 04:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
the by right in the definition or the
 
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
analysis well that's someone's
 
04:25:04.429 --> 04:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
interpretation of
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
this so they're smarter than I am thank
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony Mr
 
04:25:12.750 --> 04:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
maybery I'm going to exuse you thank you
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
Murray hello again and good afternoon Mr
 
04:25:33.070 --> 04:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and honorable members of the
 
04:25:34.910 --> 04:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
04:25:37.590 --> 04:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
Grace Murray and I support HB
 
04:25:40.030 --> 04:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
631 I work as the political director for
 
04:25:41.790 --> 04:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire youth movement we're a
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
nonprofit dedicated to getting the young
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire engaged and
 
04:25:46.630 --> 04:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
working on issues that affect them
 
04:25:49.349 --> 04:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
directly housing is is an issue that uh
 
04:25:50.830 --> 04:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
is affecting all Granite Staters right
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
now but as the people of my generation
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
graduate college and start making a life
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
for themselves we found that homes of
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
all types Apartments starter homes and
 
04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
shared homes are Out Of Reach this isn't
 
04:26:04.349 --> 04:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
surprising as according to Pew rent in
 
04:26:08.429 --> 04:26:08.439 align:start position:0%
the United States Rose 31% from 2017 to
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
2023 with too few homes available and to
 
04:26:12.670 --> 04:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
few homes being built costs are
 
04:26:14.830 --> 04:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
continuing to go up and up all the while
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
local governments are blocking
 
04:26:19.030 --> 04:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
construction of homes that we need with
 
04:26:20.870 --> 04:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh restrictive zoning
 
04:26:22.830 --> 04:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
rules thankfully the housing system
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to stay this way though um
 
04:26:27.030 --> 04:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
we can build more homes allow multif
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
family housing and utilize underused
 
04:26:31.030 --> 04:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
commercial spaces we just got to cut
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
away the red tape and that's exactly
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
what this bill does building more homes
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
in commercial corridors is an important
 
04:26:37.710 --> 04:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
step towards meeting the housing needs
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents and helping
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
young people stay in New
 
04:26:42.990 --> 04:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire municip pales have had their
 
04:26:44.590 --> 04:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
chance and it's time for our legislators
 
04:26:46.269 --> 04:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
to step in and ensure that Grant Staters
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
can find a home please support HB uh
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
631 thank you for your testimony
 
04:26:52.269 --> 04:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
questions from Miss
 
04:27:02.990 --> 04:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.630 --> 04:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
my name is uh Paul desan and I'm a
 
04:27:16.030 --> 04:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
project manager for the town of
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
Newington and I've been asked by the
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen to appear in
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
opposition uh to um House Bill
 
04:27:26.950 --> 04:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
631 um basically comes down to two
 
04:27:29.710 --> 04:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
specific issues uh one more generalistic
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
and one very specific to the bill itself
 
04:27:35.109 --> 04:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
um first of all we believe that there
 
04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
could be an unending consequences
 
04:27:40.510 --> 04:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
relative um to the definition of of
 
04:27:45.149 --> 04:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
rural versus uh urban areas uh I've been
 
04:27:47.510 --> 04:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
told by some other source I believe may
 
04:27:49.950 --> 04:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
be the manshire municipal Association
 
04:27:51.950 --> 04:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
that this proposed Bill may only impact
 
04:27:56.189 --> 04:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
18 communities in in New Hampshire um if
 
04:27:58.590 --> 04:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
you take the classic definition of of
 
04:28:01.790 --> 04:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
urban um that may be true uh but if you
 
04:28:04.109 --> 04:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
go to the US Census Bureau and use one
 
04:28:07.229 --> 04:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
of their graphic um uh visualization
 
04:28:10.189 --> 04:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
tools you check the box for urban and
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
suddenly the entire Portsmith
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area pops up um and that
 
04:28:18.630 --> 04:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
includes at least half of Newington and
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
and many other of the surrounding
 
04:28:23.710 --> 04:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
communities so that in itself may be an
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of this bill um
 
04:28:28.469 --> 04:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
because I don't think a community of 800
 
04:28:30.510 --> 04:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
people really is considered to be an
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
urban uh environment um but that's the
 
04:28:37.349 --> 04:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
reality in which uh Newton operates and
 
04:28:39.910 --> 04:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
may also be um exacerbated by the fact
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have our own ZIP code uh we
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
have to Port zip code so a lot of the
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
Census Data gets U shuffled back and
 
04:28:47.790 --> 04:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
forth even though they have census
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
tracks and that sort of thing there's
 
04:28:54.109 --> 04:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
still zip code uh uh
 
04:28:56.309 --> 04:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
related the broader content of course
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
and you probably heard this uh before is
 
04:29:00.990 --> 04:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
is the issue of local control the basic
 
04:29:03.309 --> 04:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
tenant of local control is that those
 
04:29:05.670 --> 04:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
closest to the issue are best positioned
 
04:29:07.750 --> 04:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
to address such issues for their
 
04:29:09.870 --> 04:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
Community now no doubt there's a housing
 
04:29:12.750 --> 04:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
crisis in the Hampshire
 
04:29:14.750 --> 04:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe there are other tools to to
 
04:29:17.550 --> 04:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
deal uh with this
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
crisis we just don't think
 
04:29:20.399 --> 04:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
crisis we just don't think
that

04:29:21.990 --> 04:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
totally eliminating uh in this case the
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
the local land use regulations uh is a
 
04:29:33.510 --> 04:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
Panacea uh for that uh problem Newton
 
04:29:36.189 --> 04:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
has addressed its local needs by having
 
04:29:38.469 --> 04:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
a strategic plan by having all its
 
04:29:40.630 --> 04:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
residential uses on the west side of
 
04:29:42.750 --> 04:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
Route 16 and all smallest industrial
 
04:29:45.790 --> 04:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
commercial spaces on the east side of
 
04:29:48.269 --> 04:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
the balding Turnpike this has served us
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
well um and um provided a a stable and
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
healthy tax base uh as noted before and
 
04:29:59.550 --> 04:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh has a uh a standard of living uh that
 
04:30:02.670 --> 04:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
many people in the San uh in the seast
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh area um are envy and we hope to
 
04:30:08.109 --> 04:30:08.119 align:start position:0%
continue that uh with the successful
 
04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
practices that we've had so I would
 
04:30:13.630 --> 04:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh opposition position and um
 
04:30:18.510 --> 04:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
interim study or um inexp inexpedient to
 
04:30:21.910 --> 04:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislate um based on those two two uh
 
04:30:24.750 --> 04:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
issues um open any questions thank you
 
04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
Mr desane for your testimony or
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
questions represent buo thank you Mr
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I have a question uh the
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
town of Newington what is the population
 
04:30:35.790 --> 04:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
of uh Newington about 800 about 800 Ask
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead um if this
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
legislation let's say had uh in addition
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
to the maybe it used a different
 
04:30:45.550 --> 04:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
definition of urban maybe it said um if
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
the municipality had a population of
 
04:30:50.469 --> 04:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
under I don't know 5,000 people or
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
something like that would Newington then
 
04:30:52.560 --> 04:30:54.630 align:start position:0%
something like that would Newington then
support

04:30:54.630 --> 04:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:30:57.630 --> 04:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
it in terms of its own interests I don't
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
know that it would support it but it
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
would find the opposition uh diminish
 
04:31:04.750 --> 04:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
greatly uh if we weren't then included
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the uh the the definitional element
 
04:31:10.389 --> 04:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
it still goes to the policy issue of
 
04:31:12.070 --> 04:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
whether local control is still still
 
04:31:14.189 --> 04:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
existing in
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative Reed thank you
 
04:31:18.550 --> 04:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:31:21.309 --> 04:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
question I am I represent New Market so
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not terribly far from you um and
 
04:31:26.590 --> 04:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
isn't it fair to say that Newington is
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
really an outlier amongst basically all
 
04:31:31.950 --> 04:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire towns and what I mean by
 
04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
that is um your tax rate is
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
significantly or at least it was a few
 
04:31:38.670 --> 04:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
years back significantly less than the
 
04:31:41.109 --> 04:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
average um property tax rate for most
 
04:31:42.910 --> 04:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
towns and the reason is because while
 
04:31:45.630 --> 04:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
you only have 800 people you have tons
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
and tons of businesses that help defay
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
that all that Revenue off of the backs
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
of the the property taxes that those
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
individuals have to pay and those
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
individuals tend to be on the wealthier
 
04:32:00.670 --> 04:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
end um so it doesn't really look like
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
any town in New Hampshire isn't that
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
accurate that's been my
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
experience not to go broad a field to
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
other issues like uh education funding
 
04:32:13.389 --> 04:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
um there are number of communities in
 
04:32:15.710 --> 04:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
which Newton Falls into to it that were
 
04:32:18.269 --> 04:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
considered donor towns uh so there are
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
other communities be they because
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
of vacation properties or industrial
 
04:32:28.389 --> 04:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
Properties or utility properties however
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
their tax base mix has created uh an
 
04:32:34.710 --> 04:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
enviable and and desirable tax base and
 
04:32:36.910 --> 04:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
that's a planned strategy the town of
 
04:32:40.149 --> 04:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
Newington uh implemented uh many years
 
04:32:42.269 --> 04:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
ago and we don't don't see that we
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
should be penalized for for that uh
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
under this bill let me okay thank you
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah follow up um so I guess
 
04:32:51.950 --> 04:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm getting at is the effect for
 
04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
Newington in particular which has a very
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
small but really pretty much wealthy if
 
04:33:01.109 --> 04:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
I may have put a fine point on it um
 
04:33:03.630 --> 04:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
residential population small but well
 
04:33:08.830 --> 04:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
off and a huge commercial use tax base
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
tons and tons of businesses um if you
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
were to allow those businesses to have
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
spaces that they rent out and provide
 
04:33:20.029 --> 04:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
housing all of a sudden you have a lot
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
less wealthy people moving into
 
04:33:23.629 --> 04:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
Newington even though I would think the
 
04:33:25.869 --> 04:33:25.879 align:start position:0%
assessments for those commercially zoned
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
buildings would go up because now they
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
have rental units so they would be
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
assessed more but then now you have more
 
04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
people coming into the town that are not
 
04:33:37.390 --> 04:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
as wealthy as your current population is
 
04:33:40.349 --> 04:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
that accurate I would disagree or that's
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a given
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
um first of all um the discussion
 
04:33:48.070 --> 04:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
earlier where you were talking about
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment um there aren't many
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
properties in our commercial spaces that
 
04:33:54.429 --> 04:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
are amable to direct
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment um you can't take the the
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
foxart mall very easily and convert that
 
04:34:01.709 --> 04:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
into housing it's just not laid out for
 
04:34:06.189 --> 04:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
that purpose um similarly um if you see
 
04:34:08.189 --> 04:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
the development that's occurring in
 
04:34:10.750 --> 04:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
Portsmith uh I don't see any lower
 
04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
income moving uh into those uh
 
04:34:15.629 --> 04:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
properties either so I think knon if it
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
had added housing uh caused by this bill
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily going to be of
 
04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
something other than market
 
04:34:26.590 --> 04:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
rate representative
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%
chair um you mentioned that in Newton uh
 
04:34:35.789 --> 04:34:35.799 align:start position:0%
the residential development is all on
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
one side of the spoing turnpike and the
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
Business Development is all on the other
 
04:34:43.670 --> 04:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
side but wouldn't there be an advantage
 
04:34:45.789 --> 04:34:45.799 align:start position:0%
to some residents of Newton might be
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
some new residents of new inton if there
 
04:34:51.390 --> 04:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
was some housing that they could live in
 
04:34:54.070 --> 04:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
where the places of employment are so
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
that the businesses are the places of
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
employment so that they could get to
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
their place of employment without having
 
04:35:04.830 --> 04:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
turnpike a good supposition
 
04:35:11.390 --> 04:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
but I think our strategy has proven that
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
in compatible uses residential uses in
 
04:35:15.789 --> 04:35:15.799 align:start position:0%
the middle of a commercial district and
 
04:35:18.070 --> 04:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
Industrial District
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh just doesn't allow uh lend itself to
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
the highest and best use of the
 
04:35:25.510 --> 04:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
properties involved uh Residential
 
04:35:29.109 --> 04:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
Properties are um always subject to no
 
04:35:32.470 --> 04:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
noise odors congestion lighting all
 
04:35:33.789 --> 04:35:33.799 align:start position:0%
those sort things in fact the
 
04:35:35.709 --> 04:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
residential areas on the west side of
 
04:35:38.429 --> 04:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
the Spalding still experience those
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
nuisances caused by the commercial
 
04:35:41.709 --> 04:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
property on the other side of the
 
04:35:44.070 --> 04:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
Highway uh we've had a particular long
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
and standing odor issue uh emanating uh
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
from that other side and we've even had
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
to set up a uh uh link on our website
 
04:35:55.869 --> 04:35:55.879 align:start position:0%
where people could report order uh oders
 
04:35:58.349 --> 04:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
so they could we could respond uh in a
 
04:36:00.029 --> 04:36:00.039 align:start position:0%
timely fashion and investigate those
 
04:36:02.830 --> 04:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
matters so um we just think that the
 
04:36:05.590 --> 04:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
highest and best use uh of the
 
04:36:08.189 --> 04:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
properties to the east of the Spalding
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh should remain in the commercial
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
industrial uh plan that we've exhibited
 
04:36:15.629 --> 04:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
works okay follow follow up Mr Sher yes
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you um but isn't it up shouldn't
 
04:36:22.390 --> 04:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
it be up to the property owner to decide
 
04:36:24.551 --> 04:36:24.561 align:start position:0%
whether a particular location is
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
suitable for the development of housing
 
04:36:29.349 --> 04:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
or not and shouldn't it be up to the
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
people who would live in that housing to
 
04:36:34.230 --> 04:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
decide whether it's worth it to them to
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
live in that housing if they have no
 
04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
other place to go shouldn't that be up
 
04:36:41.949 --> 04:36:41.959 align:start position:0%
to the property owner and the individual
 
04:36:43.150 --> 04:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
well then you're really advocating the
 
04:36:45.510 --> 04:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
doing away with zoning um that that's
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
the fundamental tenament tenament of of
 
04:36:52.830 --> 04:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
um zoning and L's regulation is to bring
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
order to a multitude of desires by
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
property owners that conflict with one
 
04:37:00.429 --> 04:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
another over and over again and that's
 
04:37:04.910 --> 04:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.920 --> 04:37:06.629 align:start position:0%
 
zoning

04:37:06.629 --> 04:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you for your testimony
 
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time Mr
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
Nelson Dave Nelson
 
04:37:14.990 --> 04:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
I think he
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:29.510 --> 04:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
van good afternoon for what I think is
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
the last time today thank you so much
 
04:37:34.510 --> 04:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
for having me back uh I am still Ivy van
 
04:37:36.189 --> 04:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
I am still a land use planner I still
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
have lots of opinions about housing and
 
04:37:41.551 --> 04:37:41.561 align:start position:0%
how we organize our public spaces uh I'm
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill in general um
 
04:37:46.910 --> 04:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of things I'd like to
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
mention that I think the committee
 
04:37:50.670 --> 04:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
should think about as they work on this
 
04:37:53.109 --> 04:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
bill I noticed that there was some talk
 
04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
about well maybe we should increase the
 
04:37:57.949 --> 04:37:57.959 align:start position:0%
percentage of of space that's not
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
residential in the buildings I would
 
04:38:04.189 --> 04:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
Advocate against that particularly if
 
04:38:06.990 --> 04:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
you are thinking as it seems from the
 
04:38:09.551 --> 04:38:09.561 align:start position:0%
conversation that I'm hearing of
 
04:38:14.590 --> 04:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
restricting this use for retail Offices
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
Medical Offices on the ground floor uh
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
the United States is over retailed New
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is over retailed um I would
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
cautious caution against requiring more
 
04:38:30.070 --> 04:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
retail space on the ground floor of
 
04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
mixed use buildings basically I think
 
04:38:34.349 --> 04:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
that's one of those things like parking
 
04:38:37.629 --> 04:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
that we're really bad at figuring out
 
04:38:39.789 --> 04:38:39.799 align:start position:0%
how much of it we need and right now we
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
have in general too much of it the other
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
thing I'd like to say I think the issues
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
around you know does this belong in
 
04:38:48.510 --> 04:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
industrial areas is an interesting
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
question I think it sort of it's likely
 
04:38:53.551 --> 04:38:53.561 align:start position:0%
to be a caseby casee thing one way to
 
04:38:57.551 --> 04:38:57.561 align:start position:0%
address that would be
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
to to if I were writing code that would
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
deal with this I think I would talk
 
04:39:08.990 --> 04:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
about the uses that you are interested
 
04:39:09.000 --> 04:39:09.789 align:start position:0%
about the uses that you are interested
in

04:39:09.789 --> 04:39:09.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:39:13.709 --> 04:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
seeing um in the same area and make that
 
04:39:16.470 --> 04:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
clear a definitional change which I
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
think came up earlier today uh the other
 
04:39:21.629 --> 04:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
thing I would like to say is I think
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
that rehabbing strip malls into housing
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
is a really swell plan and we should get
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
right on that um that's those are uh in
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
my part of the world and probably in
 
04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
yours too we have empty spaces in our
 
04:39:39.990 --> 04:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
strip malls they have giant parking lots
 
04:39:43.470 --> 04:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
um that could accommod ate more housing
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
um you can make them a place by actually
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
putting down a street Grid in that giant
 
04:39:50.830 --> 04:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
parking lot so that you end up with a
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
place in not a bunch of random buildings
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
um so I would urge the committee to take
 
04:39:58.350 --> 04:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
this seriously work work on it a little
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
bit maybe add some
 
04:40:03.670 --> 04:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
definitions um and support it in the
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee and on the house floor and I'm
 
04:40:07.270 --> 04:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
miss van represent Reed thank you Mr
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you honor hble former
 
04:40:16.750 --> 04:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative of IBM um this is your
 
04:40:19.628 --> 04:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
area of expertise and so I'm glad you
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
brought up the strip mall thing because
 
04:40:23.230 --> 04:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
as it turns out I happen to know for a
 
04:40:24.430 --> 04:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
fact that the foxart mall has been
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
discussed in terms of producing um
 
04:40:29.070 --> 04:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
housing inside of it so my question is
 
04:40:30.510 --> 04:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
do you think that the argument that we
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
heard earlier being that this is your
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
area of expertise that allowing
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings to allow for
 
04:40:41.788 --> 04:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
residential use within them that would
 
04:40:45.030 --> 04:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
somehow drive out all business and then
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
towns wouldn't have any businesses in
 
04:40:49.590 --> 04:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
them and it would vastly shift the tax
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
burden of the town somehow do you think
 
04:40:54.788 --> 04:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
that's a plausible argument no I do
 
04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
not I I think that I think there's a lot
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
of concern about well if we allow these
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
changes then you know terrible things
 
04:41:04.590 --> 04:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
will happen which by the way is one of
 
04:41:06.750 --> 04:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons that I come in and advocate
 
04:41:08.910 --> 04:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
for these bills at the state level as a
 
04:41:11.590 --> 04:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
person who works at the Town level it is
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
really hard for a town to take the jump
 
04:41:17.430 --> 04:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
to make a change they need towns need
 
04:41:19.788 --> 04:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
direction at the state
 
04:41:23.070 --> 04:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
level thank you um representative buo
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um my my question
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
is uh in terms of uh are can you give
 
04:41:32.510 --> 04:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
examples of other uh States or maybe
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
other uh communities which have adopted
 
04:41:37.628 --> 04:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
similar legislation I remember reading
 
04:41:39.750 --> 04:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
something that I think in Japan they
 
04:41:42.510 --> 04:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
have um how housing as of right in all
 
04:41:43.830 --> 04:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
of their commercial zones cuz they have
 
04:41:46.270 --> 04:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
a national zoning scheme but do you um
 
04:41:47.350 --> 04:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
know of something like here in the
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
United States where people have
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
implemented this well if you think about
 
04:41:55.948 --> 04:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
any um any city or town that exists that
 
04:41:57.788 --> 04:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
was built before
 
04:42:00.990 --> 04:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
1970 they're all like this I mean if I
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
think about Cambridge Massachusetts you
 
04:42:06.190 --> 04:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
got spas on every corner I mean there's
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of examples of places
 
04:42:11.590 --> 04:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
that are good places to live
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
economically viable car light in some
 
04:42:18.350 --> 04:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
cases that are exist because of the
 
04:42:21.390 --> 04:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
ability to have both housing and other
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
uses in the same place do I think you
 
04:42:24.750 --> 04:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
should put a fertilizer plant in a
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood no I do not but do I think
 
04:42:28.868 --> 04:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
that you ought to be able to have a
 
04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood bar yes I do I I think it's
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
crazy that we put bars out on the edge
 
04:42:35.350 --> 04:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
of the highway where everybody has to
 
04:42:42.030 --> 04:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:43.628 --> 04:42:43.638 align:start position:0%
yeah so just so just quick qu I
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with you I mean I think
 
04:42:46.948 --> 04:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of parts of New Hampshire you know
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
everyone thinks of you know the quaint
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
Charming parts of our New England towns
 
04:42:52.150 --> 04:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
that we all love and you're right they a
 
04:42:54.270 --> 04:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
lot of them were built um not just
 
04:42:56.470 --> 04:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
before you know 1970 a lot of them were
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
built even earlier before zoning even
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
existed right so I definitely sympathize
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
with that argument but modern Lifestyles
 
04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
have changed you know people have
 
04:43:06.150 --> 04:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
changed so in terms of contemporary you
 
04:43:08.830 --> 04:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
know currently is is there a maybe
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
well-known example that we could study
 
04:43:13.830 --> 04:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
or look at at regarding currently in the
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
United States where housing uh is
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
allowed by right in a commercial Zone uh
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
any any city that
 
04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
has housing and uses and that's that's
 
04:43:31.708 --> 04:43:31.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester that's new that's uh NASA
 
04:43:35.430 --> 04:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's Milford New Hampshire um all of
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
those places allow housing in their
 
04:43:42.110 --> 04:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
downtowns which have by definition other
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
uses those are remember I talked earlier
 
04:43:47.230 --> 04:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
about the economic um effect of how we
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
build our places places that have mixed
 
04:43:53.270 --> 04:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
use are economically Sounder than places
 
04:43:55.550 --> 04:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
that don't we have plenty of examples of
 
04:43:58.270 --> 04:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
this in the UN right now
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh in New Hampshire we
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
have too many examples of places that
 
04:44:07.390 --> 04:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
exist like this but where those uses are
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
existing non-conforming uses and what I
 
04:44:13.510 --> 04:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
love about this is that this would
 
04:44:15.990 --> 04:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate the whole question of existing
 
04:44:18.390 --> 04:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
non-conforming uses in existing
 
04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
downtowns um it's really imperative if
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
towns are going to be successful as
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
places for people to be live successful
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
economically for them to lean into those
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
mixed juuse areas that they already have
 
04:44:36.910 --> 04:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
or allow them to be created if they
 
04:44:43.868 --> 04:44:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:45.788 --> 04:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
Miss fan do you think that this bill
 
04:44:48.750 --> 04:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
could be improved by simplifying it in
 
04:44:53.470 --> 04:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
in and in in such a way that we can have
 
04:44:56.270 --> 04:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
that it clarifies that the downtown
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
Peter Bros the downtown
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
Keen the downtown milfords is is the is
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
the goal and what we're trying to allow
 
04:45:07.230 --> 04:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
rather than confiscating every
 
04:45:10.030 --> 04:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
industrial plot in the state yes I think
 
04:45:12.030 --> 04:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
it could be rewt I would be careful
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
about how I did that because one of the
 
04:45:18.070 --> 04:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
things that we are acutely aware of is
 
04:45:19.868 --> 04:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of development are we
 
04:45:22.150 --> 04:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
getting along our state highways I'm
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
working on a project right now in Maine
 
04:45:27.070 --> 04:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
where there's a state highway and right
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
now it's zon for Big Box commercial they
 
04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
don't want that what they want is they
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
want to be able to pull their
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
downtown uh the sort of form and pattern
 
04:45:43.150 --> 04:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
of their downtown down that down that
 
04:45:45.310 --> 04:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
state highway so that they don't end up
 
04:45:47.470 --> 04:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
with you know Market Basket followed by
 
04:45:49.948 --> 04:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
Home Depot followed they want to see a
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
mixed use area so I'd be really careful
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
about how I defined that um and one way
 
04:45:59.788 --> 04:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
to do it is I I'm pretty sure that most
 
04:46:01.708 --> 04:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
of the codes in New Hampshire
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
differentiate between industrial uses
 
04:46:06.750 --> 04:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
and Commercial uses and I think if you
 
04:46:09.150 --> 04:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
had a definition in this bill that made
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
clear that you were not talking about
 
04:46:15.788 --> 04:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
strictly industrial uses that it might
 
04:46:18.510 --> 04:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
be um a better
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
Bill represent thank you for coming to
 
04:46:23.470 --> 04:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
my TED
 
04:46:27.190 --> 04:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
Talk representative Reed thank you again
 
04:46:28.708 --> 04:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you again for taking
 
04:46:31.548 --> 04:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
my question if you permit me to kind of
 
04:46:34.270 --> 04:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
be really philosophical for a second we
 
04:46:37.110 --> 04:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
are talking about the ability to sleep
 
04:46:39.190 --> 04:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
in a building by right yeah and when
 
04:46:40.948 --> 04:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the ability to sleep
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
been a building by right in the middle
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the housing crisis being the biggest
 
04:46:47.868 --> 04:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
crisis we are facing as a state with the
 
04:46:49.548 --> 04:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
fact that housing is right up there at
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
the top of masa's hierarchy and that is
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
something we need to live especially in
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
a state that gets as cold as we do yeah
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
um philosophically
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
speaking what is the philosophical basis
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
other than what you mentioned like
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
fertilizer plants and like actual health
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
concerns actual health and safety what
 
04:47:10.510 --> 04:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
is the Phil philosophical basis for
 
04:47:13.070 --> 04:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
saying that people don't have a right to
 
04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
sleep in a building that they have legal
 
04:47:15.040 --> 04:47:16.030 align:start position:0%
sleep in a building that they have legal
access

04:47:16.030 --> 04:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
to I actually would agree with you I
 
04:47:22.830 --> 04:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
mean my only concern here is that um in
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
the interest of making clear what the
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
goal is that there be some language that
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
talks about what are the uses that we
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
think are incompatible with housing and
 
04:47:36.390 --> 04:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's all um and again someone earlier
 
04:47:38.310 --> 04:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned well nothing says you have to
 
04:47:40.350 --> 04:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
sell that land and nothing does sell
 
04:47:43.230 --> 04:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
that say that you have to sell that land
 
04:47:45.990 --> 04:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
um so if a town owns an industrial park
 
04:47:49.548 --> 04:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
and feels like it's likely to be used a
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
lot of them are empty um Peterborough
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
has I think a parcel that's about 78
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
Acres that's been standing empty well as
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
long as I've been paying attention which
 
04:48:00.708 --> 04:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
is a really long time and it's got water
 
04:48:02.910 --> 04:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
and sewer out there but there's no
 
04:48:04.948 --> 04:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
industry coming I would love to see that
 
04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
parcel turned into a mixed juuse area
 
04:48:09.750 --> 04:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
and I think there are other places that
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
have that same situ ation okay thank you
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
miss van thank you for your testimony
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for having me and I'll
 
04:48:16.750 --> 04:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
see you all next week I expect see you
 
04:48:16.760 --> 04:48:17.830 align:start position:0%
see you all next week I expect see you
next

04:48:17.830 --> 04:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.070 --> 04:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
mushin afternoon chairman Alexander
 
04:48:31.230 --> 04:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee good to see you
 
04:48:33.150 --> 04:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
again uh my name is Matt mushan I live
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
in Claremont and I serve as the advocacy
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
and engagement director for 603 forward
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
here to testify in support of House Bill
 
04:48:42.708 --> 04:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
631 today uh because it's a critical
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that would really
 
04:48:46.430 --> 04:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
allow for the development of more homes
 
04:48:49.310 --> 04:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
in commercial zones across New Hampshire
 
04:48:51.310 --> 04:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh directly addressing one of the most
 
04:48:52.990 --> 04:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
pressing issues we face which is the
 
04:48:55.310 --> 04:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
availability and the affordability of
 
04:48:58.830 --> 04:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
housing across New Hampshire our workers
 
04:49:01.548 --> 04:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
uh teachers child care providers retail
 
04:49:04.110 --> 04:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
workers and many others are struggling
 
04:49:06.750 --> 04:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
to find homes that they can uh that they
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
can afford near their workplaces this is
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
a challenge that negatively affects our
 
04:49:13.470 --> 04:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
communities but also our businesses and
 
04:49:15.788 --> 04:49:15.798 align:start position:0%
our economy so by permitting multif
 
04:49:17.150 --> 04:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
family housing and mixed use
 
04:49:19.190 --> 04:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
developments in commercial zones uh
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
hb631 would provide a smart solution to
 
04:49:25.270 --> 04:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
really just help bridge this Gap and um
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
there we think of it as like five really
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
simple uh reasons that this bill matters
 
04:49:31.510 --> 04:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
one of them being that IT addresses the
 
04:49:33.868 --> 04:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
housing shortage second being it will
 
04:49:36.750 --> 04:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
lower our housing costs uh third being
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
it will shorten commute times and give
 
04:49:41.230 --> 04:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
people better access to jobs
 
04:49:43.350 --> 04:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh fourth opportunities for property
 
04:49:45.390 --> 04:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
owners by unlocking economic potential
 
04:49:48.190 --> 04:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
of underutilized commercial spaces um
 
04:49:49.830 --> 04:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the benefits of mixed
 
04:49:51.190 --> 04:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
use development we know that a lot of
 
04:49:53.430 --> 04:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
young people want to be able to live in
 
04:49:55.350 --> 04:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
places where they can leave their house
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
in the morning walk down the street get
 
04:49:58.750 --> 04:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
the haircut grab a coffee uh do some
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
things and go back home without having
 
04:50:02.110 --> 04:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
to hop in their car and uh Drive 20
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
minutes to do some of that New Hampshire
 
04:50:06.070 --> 04:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
is facing a serious housing crisis as
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
you've all heard um and this really does
 
04:50:09.868 --> 04:50:09.878 align:start position:0%
provide a solution that meets the needs
 
04:50:14.110 --> 04:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
of both residents and businesses um and
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
it helps to ensure that the people who
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
serve our communities can afford to live
 
04:50:21.150 --> 04:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
and stay uh in the places that they work
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
while also fostering stronger more
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
resilient communities across our state
 
04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons we urge you to uh
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
support Bill 631 and I would take any
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Nick
 
04:50:36.240 --> 04:50:41.230 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Nick
Taylor

04:50:41.230 --> 04:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:42.510 --> 04:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:50:44.070 --> 04:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Nick Taylor director for
 
04:50:45.628 --> 04:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
housing action New Hampshire we're here
 
04:50:48.670 --> 04:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill um although we
 
04:50:49.750 --> 04:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
certainly are looking forward to working
 
04:50:51.190 --> 04:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
with the committee because it seems like
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
there are some areas where we could
 
04:50:54.190 --> 04:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
improve this I mean the real question
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
behind this is we all know we've have a
 
04:50:57.430 --> 04:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
shortage of Housing and we're growing
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
and people are living longer the
 
04:51:00.628 --> 04:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
question is where do we want to put it
 
04:51:02.350 --> 04:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
the concept behind here being that
 
04:51:04.830 --> 04:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
looking at already built out commercial
 
04:51:06.670 --> 04:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
zones is a good place to look because
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
there's existing infrastructure there
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
the roads the water the sewer we're not
 
04:51:12.708 --> 04:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
building out into our Open Spaces we're
 
04:51:14.430 --> 04:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
building out into the places where there
 
04:51:16.750 --> 04:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
are jobs where people can walk to work
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
where the infrastructure exists and
 
04:51:20.310 --> 04:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
we're increasing property rights by
 
04:51:22.628 --> 04:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
letting Property Owners develop things
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
as they see fit um a couple questions
 
04:51:26.750 --> 04:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
that have come up around other states
 
04:51:28.990 --> 04:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
Mont Montana and Arizona have both
 
04:51:32.230 --> 04:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
passed legislation similar in concept to
 
04:51:33.628 --> 04:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
this and we're happy to pull those bills
 
04:51:34.990 --> 04:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
and get them to the committee for folks
 
04:51:38.110 --> 04:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
to review um on the tax question New
 
04:51:40.190 --> 04:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing had contracted with
 
04:51:42.868 --> 04:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
Urban three group to do some assessments
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
around value per acre in New Hampshire
 
04:51:47.470 --> 04:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
mixed use development has the highest
 
04:51:49.868 --> 04:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
value per acre in New Hampshire so in
 
04:51:52.110 --> 04:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
terms of targeting sort of the tax base
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
to where things are the most valuable
 
04:51:57.628 --> 04:51:57.638 align:start position:0%
mixed use is that based on New Hampshire
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
data and there's some really interesting
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
facts and figures in there um we
 
04:52:03.830 --> 04:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
certainly have no opposition to the idea
 
04:52:05.830 --> 04:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
of removing manufacturing or industrial
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
zones I think the intent here is to put
 
04:52:09.830 --> 04:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
it near retail near office near walkable
 
04:52:11.230 --> 04:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
areas where folks FKS want to live that
 
04:52:13.070 --> 04:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
are within the health and safety
 
04:52:15.948 --> 04:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
elements that are the root of zoning um
 
04:52:17.708 --> 04:52:17.718 align:start position:0%
and then we do think generally speaking
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
that flexibility is helpful for
 
04:52:22.110 --> 04:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
developers our members who are talking
 
04:52:24.430 --> 04:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
about how can they make projects work
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
things that sort of put real specific
 
04:52:28.590 --> 04:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
restrictions on them about exactly what
 
04:52:30.190 --> 04:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
their first floor has to look like
 
04:52:32.430 --> 04:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
exactly who has to be there is difficult
 
04:52:35.230 --> 04:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
to make work as times change and so we
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
would just as a general matter encourage
 
04:52:39.470 --> 04:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
the committee to think about flexibility
 
04:52:40.948 --> 04:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
think about the intent here
 
04:52:42.910 --> 04:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
and then help make it workable so happy
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and we'll provide
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
those follow-up items thank you for your
 
04:52:48.270 --> 04:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
testimony questions for Mr Taylor
 
04:52:48.280 --> 04:52:49.350 align:start position:0%
testimony questions for Mr Taylor
representative

04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:52.190 --> 04:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:52:55.070 --> 04:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
for coming in to testify this afternoon
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that um it might be
 
04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
better if the um uh permitted use were
 
04:53:05.868 --> 04:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
limited to Commercial and office areas
 
04:53:08.430 --> 04:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
but there's been a discussion of empty
 
04:53:10.750 --> 04:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
industrial parks if there were an EMP
 
04:53:12.990 --> 04:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
industrial park that was already served
 
04:53:15.390 --> 04:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
by City Water and Sewer might it not
 
04:53:19.830 --> 04:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
make sense to um change that over if
 
04:53:21.990 --> 04:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's already a building to repurposes
 
04:53:24.190 --> 04:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
the housing or to build housing on the
 
04:53:26.430 --> 04:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
land if there's not a building
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
there no I think that's a I think that's
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
a good point and I think that also gets
 
04:53:32.590 --> 04:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
back to the Restriction element of how
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
specific you want to get with this and
 
04:53:37.708 --> 04:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
so you know putting in health and safety
 
04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
barriers or or you know um barometers
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
there I think is a good idea but keeping
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
the flexibility so that if there is
 
04:53:47.948 --> 04:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity locally that that would make
 
04:53:49.990 --> 04:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
sense thank you for your testimony Mr
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
Taylor excent thank
 
04:54:02.788 --> 04:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:05.470 --> 04:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
Hooper wello again chairman Alexander
 
04:54:06.830 --> 04:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
Vice chair co- members of the committee
 
04:54:08.110 --> 04:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again my name is
 
04:54:09.628 --> 04:54:09.638 align:start position:0%
Samuel Hooper I'm legislative counsel
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
with the institute for J this speaking
 
04:54:14.708 --> 04:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill 631 um I think
 
04:54:15.990 --> 04:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of previous Witnesses have
 
04:54:17.590 --> 04:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned things that could certainly
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
potentially be improved in the bill but
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
broadly we're supportive and I have to
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
be careful here I'm very conscious of
 
04:54:24.270 --> 04:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
the Optics of someone with an English
 
04:54:25.750 --> 04:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
accent coming here and saying other
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
countries do things really well but I
 
04:54:29.350 --> 04:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
think it is I don't think we're worried
 
04:54:32.190 --> 04:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
about that but thank you it is
 
04:54:33.628 --> 04:54:33.638 align:start position:0%
particularly coming from Texas I'm
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
especially sensitive to that um but it
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
is the case that a lot of the places we
 
04:54:39.150 --> 04:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
like to visit in other countries you
 
04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
know if you go to Barcelona or a lot of
 
04:54:43.070 --> 04:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
places there are places where you have
 
04:54:45.868 --> 04:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
mixed use you have work rest and play
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
combined in a neighborhood you don't
 
04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
have to walk you don't necessarily need
 
04:54:51.910 --> 04:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
a car to function although you certainly
 
04:54:54.110 --> 04:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
have one if you want but just having
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
that flexibility and freedom is really
 
04:54:58.150 --> 04:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
good I think um as as previous witness
 
04:54:59.628 --> 04:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple of states do already
 
04:55:01.470 --> 04:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
do this like they've passed bills and
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will see that but it is
 
04:55:04.948 --> 04:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
frustrating as other people have said to
 
04:55:07.350 --> 04:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
note that that just the sheer percentage
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
of existing places that are very
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
desirable to live would not be legal to
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
build today were they to be you know
 
04:55:14.590 --> 04:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
were you to try and permit them today
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know huge sways of Manhattan large
 
04:55:18.670 --> 04:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
part of Manchester New Hampshire large
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
part of Austin Texas where I'm from just
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
would not be legal because they were
 
04:55:25.230 --> 04:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
designed you know pre-1970 when um mixed
 
04:55:27.910 --> 04:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
use was taken for granted when you know
 
04:55:30.030 --> 04:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
the idea that you would need you know a
 
04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
car per individual in a household to to
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
to function in the economy just didn't
 
04:55:35.948 --> 04:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
exists so I think you know it's very
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
good from that perspective um again we
 
04:55:39.470 --> 04:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
at The Institute for justice come at
 
04:55:40.830 --> 04:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
this from the perspective of property
 
04:55:42.788 --> 04:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
rights um but we think that this is an
 
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
issue where hopefully people from you
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
know different perspectives can can
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
agree there are a couple of points I did
 
04:55:49.948 --> 04:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
want to mention that did come up um one
 
04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
of them was around the 20% of uh first
 
04:55:55.110 --> 04:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
floor being reserved to retail I think
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
we all love to see those buildings when
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
there can be resale on the first floor I
 
04:56:00.830 --> 04:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
will be wary of mandating any specific
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
percentage though because I'm very aware
 
04:56:04.990 --> 04:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
that just the economics don't work
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere for that to take place like
 
04:56:08.230 --> 04:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
you need a certain amount of foot
 
04:56:10.270 --> 04:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
traffic and other things in order to
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
support that level of retail and if you
 
04:56:14.270 --> 04:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
were to put in an arbitrary number what
 
04:56:15.910 --> 04:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
that can actually do is prevent such
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
projects and penciling altogether which
 
04:56:19.590 --> 04:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
isn't unintended consequence and isn't
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
something that you want to happen um
 
04:56:24.190 --> 04:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
another witness previously mentioned you
 
04:56:25.230 --> 04:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
know would you want a housing
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
development in a commercial zone or um
 
04:56:31.470 --> 04:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
Alo or an industrial Zone um from my
 
04:56:32.910 --> 04:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
perspective I'd be very loed to tell
 
04:56:34.590 --> 04:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
anyone you know where you can put
 
04:56:35.830 --> 04:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
housing and I think there's different
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of industrial as well you know
 
04:56:39.910 --> 04:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's industrial smelting works and
 
04:56:41.590 --> 04:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's Light Industry as well which can
 
04:56:43.628 --> 04:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
be very good to have nearby where you
 
04:56:45.310 --> 04:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
work um I think of some of the new
 
04:56:47.150 --> 04:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
developments in East Austin close to
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
where I live where there are um you know
 
04:56:53.868 --> 04:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
Artisan um furniture makers Brewers all
 
04:56:56.190 --> 04:56:56.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of other things that are in dense
 
04:56:58.190 --> 04:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
walkable areas with retail and housing
 
04:56:59.590 --> 04:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
nearby so I don't think that should be
 
04:57:01.510 --> 04:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
an impediment I think certainly we can
 
04:57:03.470 --> 04:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
potentially tweak the definition and I'd
 
04:57:05.310 --> 04:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
be more than happy to consult and give
 
04:57:07.310 --> 04:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
any advice and guidance that might be
 
04:57:09.510 --> 04:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
necessary or or helpful if that's the
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
case but I would be wary of trying to
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
restrict this too much generally we come
 
04:57:14.430 --> 04:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
at this again from a property rights
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
perspective and we think the broader the
 
04:57:18.470 --> 04:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
better um and finally I just go back to
 
04:57:19.708 --> 04:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
the collective action problem people
 
04:57:21.230 --> 04:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
have talked a lot in this hearing you
 
04:57:23.310 --> 04:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
know opposing or being neutral on the
 
04:57:25.230 --> 04:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
bill about local control and there is
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
always a time in place for local control
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
where the issues are only local but the
 
04:57:31.270 --> 04:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
housing crisis of course is not a local
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
issue it's a Statewide it's an
 
04:57:35.350 --> 04:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
interstate it's a national issue um and
 
04:57:36.830 --> 04:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
the risk is if you have this Collective
 
04:57:39.030 --> 04:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
action problem then local municipalities
 
04:57:40.590 --> 04:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
will look to others to do the work I
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
mean you have all local municipalities
 
04:57:44.510 --> 04:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
looking to others to do the work to Bear
 
04:57:46.548 --> 04:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
the burden of taking steps to increase
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
property rights to to enable more
 
04:57:50.070 --> 04:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
housing then no one does it and that's
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
how you end up in this position now so
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
um again I thank the committee very much
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
for their consideration of all of these
 
04:57:56.708 --> 04:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
bills all of which we at The Institute
 
04:57:59.390 --> 04:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
for justice support I'm very happy to
 
04:58:00.670 --> 04:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
take any further questions that you
 
04:58:02.670 --> 04:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
might have thank you representative
 
04:58:05.070 --> 04:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
Hicks thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:58:06.430 --> 04:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
for uh taking the question and
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
testifying today so um about the issue
 
04:58:11.190 --> 04:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
of local control
 
04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
the weal two in here talking about
 
04:58:17.350 --> 04:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
designated as an urban area would you be
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
supportive of removing that has also
 
04:58:21.830 --> 04:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
been suggested so that this could be
 
04:58:23.430 --> 04:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
more broadly applied to more
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities in New
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think philosophically yes we
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
would be supportive of that I think this
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
is one issue where when we talk about
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
the highest best use of land the market
 
04:58:34.590 --> 04:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
generally does decide very well you're
 
04:58:37.070 --> 04:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
not going to have a kind of very dense
 
04:58:39.390 --> 04:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
um walkable place where you don't need a
 
04:58:41.070 --> 04:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
car somewhere that is very rural and is
 
04:58:42.430 --> 04:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
isolated so that's not something that
 
04:58:43.990 --> 04:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
should necessarily be legally required
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
we think that the market can generally
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
control for those things so um I
 
04:58:48.350 --> 04:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the principle
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
behind that because urban areas are
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
where you would most likely see these
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
kind of mixed developments that that we
 
04:58:54.708 --> 04:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
like but I don't think it's necessarily
 
04:58:58.030 --> 04:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
law thank you very much Mr chairman okay
 
04:59:03.070 --> 04:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here to testify
 
04:59:17.708 --> 04:59:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:20.830 --> 04:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Freeman
 
04:59:25.628 --> 04:59:25.638 align:start position:0%
up Chris Freeman um so uh I think it's
 
04:59:27.788 --> 04:59:27.798 align:start position:0%
uh it's great that the bill has a very
 
04:59:30.990 --> 04:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
broad definition of commercial property
 
04:59:32.230 --> 04:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
um I think at the heart of the bill is
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
the question of how much Freedom should
 
04:59:35.830 --> 04:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
we give to property owners and the only
 
04:59:39.270 --> 04:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
correct answer in my book is a lot um
 
04:59:40.990 --> 04:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
one of the gentlemen who spoke before me
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
raised the issue of local control
 
04:59:45.708 --> 04:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
arguing that um those who are closest to
 
04:59:48.510 --> 04:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
the issues are in the best position to
 
04:59:51.150 --> 04:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
address them and I agree with that 100%
 
04:59:52.390 --> 04:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
which is why I believe that it should be
 
04:59:54.750 --> 04:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
up to the property owners to solve those
 
04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
issues um uh Mr Mayberry um I very much
 
05:00:00.190 --> 05:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate all of your work uh in this
 
05:00:01.510 --> 05:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
space but I I would like to offer a
 
05:00:03.310 --> 05:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
slightly different perspective on one
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
point that you raised um you had
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
expressed concern about the um the huge
 
05:00:09.708 --> 05:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
rush of demand for land that's currently
 
05:00:12.070 --> 05:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
used for industrial purposes and if
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's true if there is huge pent up
 
05:00:15.708 --> 05:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
demand for this land then what it means
 
05:00:17.270 --> 05:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
is that that land's not currently being
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
used for its highest and best use which
 
05:00:21.190 --> 05:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately is determined by markets and
 
05:00:23.590 --> 05:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
not by voters or government
 
05:00:26.670 --> 05:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
bodies um the bill also isn't just about
 
05:00:28.350 --> 05:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
taking all of the industrial land that
 
05:00:30.510 --> 05:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
we have and immediately converting it
 
05:00:32.990 --> 05:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
into multif family housing um certainly
 
05:00:34.750 --> 05:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
it opens the door for multif family but
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
it also opens the door for um the
 
05:00:39.430 --> 05:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
organic formation of live work
 
05:00:39.440 --> 05:00:40.470 align:start position:0%
organic formation of live work
communities

05:00:40.470 --> 05:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:00:44.150 --> 05:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh so when I when I think about
 
05:00:46.150 --> 05:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
that I think you know well why shouldn't
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
we have the midrise multif family next
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
to the biomedical research facility uh
 
05:00:52.230 --> 05:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't we see industrial parks
 
05:00:53.788 --> 05:00:53.798 align:start position:0%
that actually have people strolling
 
05:00:55.868 --> 05:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
underneath the the shade of the trees
 
05:00:57.470 --> 05:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
like they showed in the developer pitch
 
05:01:01.110 --> 05:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
deck I think that that would be great um
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
I I recently read a book by uh architect
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
and design theorist Christopher
 
05:01:06.030 --> 05:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
Alexander who I'm pretty sure I'm not
 
05:01:07.470 --> 05:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
related to and I don't think you are
 
05:01:11.350 --> 05:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
either um but he talked about um the the
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
concept of scattered work and how do you
 
05:01:16.270 --> 05:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
distribute work within uh your society
 
05:01:17.910 --> 05:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
and how do you build a community around
 
05:01:21.230 --> 05:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
work and he talks about the idea of we
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
have this question where do you live and
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a it seems simple on its
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
face but where do you
 
05:01:30.670 --> 05:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
live there's an implication that we
 
05:01:33.430 --> 05:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't live in the places that we work
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
right you go to work and that's not
 
05:01:38.030 --> 05:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
living it's not life and um by by kind
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
of merging these spaces you have an
 
05:01:42.230 --> 05:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
opport opportunity to to bring you know
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
that other 30% of your life um you kind
 
05:01:46.590 --> 05:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
of back into the fold you can you can be
 
05:01:48.070 --> 05:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
close you need to run home for lunch you
 
05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
can take care of that you have kids you
 
05:01:52.110 --> 05:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
can take care of that um but also the
 
05:01:54.510 --> 05:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
the aspect of the pride that people take
 
05:01:56.190 --> 05:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
in the places where they live versus The
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
Pride that people take in the places
 
05:02:00.030 --> 05:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
where they work um and so when you have
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
a concentration of commercial to the
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
exclusion of residential uh those areas
 
05:02:06.548 --> 05:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
tend to feel very sterile often over
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
times the the um you know facilities
 
05:02:11.548 --> 05:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
become kind of neglected and it starts
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
to feel like a place where life doesn't
 
05:02:18.670 --> 05:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
go um I think the the gentleman that
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
spoke before me with the much nicer
 
05:02:26.110 --> 05:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
accent to listen to um he talked about
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
the medieval cities of Europe and and I
 
05:02:29.548 --> 05:02:29.558 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree more he actually stole my
 
05:02:32.470 --> 05:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
example of uh Barcelona uh you know
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
let's look at some of these cities that
 
05:02:35.788 --> 05:02:35.798 align:start position:0%
everybody in the world loves to travel
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
to where where life happened and formed
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
organically large ly before uh you know
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
we had master plan overlays that were
 
05:02:44.590 --> 05:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
written by people with horn drimed
 
05:02:47.190 --> 05:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
glasses and elbow patches uh that's my
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
stereotype of an urban planner um I I
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
think that they're really excellent
 
05:02:52.590 --> 05:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
places to live and I think that the more
 
05:02:54.548 --> 05:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
we can borrow from that successful model
 
05:02:56.910 --> 05:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
the more human scale and human oriented
 
05:02:58.948 --> 05:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
our communities are going to be uh and
 
05:03:00.670 --> 05:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
then lastly uh one thing I didn't hear
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else's testimony but it does
 
05:03:04.590 --> 05:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
seem to be anticipated by the bill uh in
 
05:03:06.310 --> 05:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
the definitions it talks about adaptive
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
reuse as a development that R retains at
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
least two exterior walls of an existing
 
05:03:13.830 --> 05:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
building and adaptive reuse is an area
 
05:03:16.110 --> 05:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
um that I have a a special interest in
 
05:03:18.788 --> 05:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
uh because it represents a a very
 
05:03:20.948 --> 05:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
approachable uh way to Bringing new
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
housing online um which is by taking
 
05:03:25.510 --> 05:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
existing buildings that have reached a
 
05:03:27.628 --> 05:03:27.638 align:start position:0%
state of functional obsolescence and
 
05:03:30.430 --> 05:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
turning them into housing um and the
 
05:03:32.948 --> 05:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
reason that this is more attainable um
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
currently to to build from the ground up
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
a new multif family development runs
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
around 300 to 350
 
05:03:43.868 --> 05:03:43.878 align:start position:0%
per square foot and where even as high
 
05:03:46.628 --> 05:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
as rents are those projects don't pencil
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
out unless you receiving significant
 
05:03:51.070 --> 05:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
federal subsidy so so you don't have the
 
05:03:53.110 --> 05:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
development of market rate you know full
 
05:03:55.230 --> 05:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing um or even kind of
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
mid-range or upper mid-range housing um
 
05:03:59.788 --> 05:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
adaptive reuse on the other hand so
 
05:04:01.628 --> 05:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
think about Mill buildings think about
 
05:04:03.910 --> 05:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
buildings that um likely already exist
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
within commercial districts um you can
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
you can retrofit those for significantly
 
05:04:11.150 --> 05:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
less we've looked at a few properties um
 
05:04:12.990 --> 05:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
and priced out Redevelopment and if
 
05:04:14.470 --> 05:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
you're just doing an interior retrofit
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
full gut back to the studs you might be
 
05:04:19.788 --> 05:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
as low as $150 a square foot on on the
 
05:04:21.430 --> 05:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
renovation cost so if you can acquire
 
05:04:24.670 --> 05:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
that building you know 3050 $60 a square
 
05:04:26.910 --> 05:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
foot um you could end up in there for
 
05:04:29.030 --> 05:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
about 30% less than what it would cost
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
to buy raw land and build from the
 
05:04:31.680 --> 05:04:33.830 align:start position:0%
to buy raw land and build from the
ground

05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
ground
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
up thank you for your testimony
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Hicks thank Mr
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for the taking the
 
05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
question um I might come at this a
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
little bit differently so I walk to work
 
05:04:47.310 --> 05:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
every day um I bought the house next to
 
05:04:49.150 --> 05:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
the where I work so I could walk to work
 
05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
every day uh and I employe teachers and
 
05:04:53.948 --> 05:04:53.958 align:start position:0%
childcare workers they can't walk to
 
05:04:55.070 --> 05:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
work every day because they couldn't
 
05:04:57.788 --> 05:04:57.798 align:start position:0%
afford to live in my neighborhood um I
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
am fortunate enough do you think that
 
05:05:03.868 --> 05:05:03.878 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill would help
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
potentially employers build housing for
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
their employees to create more s
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities like I have
 
05:05:12.670 --> 05:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
I think so uh one of the other concerns
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
that was raised was when when uh new
 
05:05:16.510 --> 05:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
businesses are looking to move into an
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
area they have the question of where is
 
05:05:20.510 --> 05:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
their Workforce going to come from and
 
05:05:22.510 --> 05:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
to me the idea of a live work Community
 
05:05:23.948 --> 05:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
which is fundamentally what this opens
 
05:05:28.430 --> 05:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.310 --> 05:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you for your
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else here to
 
05:05:36.190 --> 05:05:36.200 align:start position:0%

05:05:39.670 --> 05:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing at 303
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.548 --> 05:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
no all right so um at this point I
 
05:05:47.910 --> 05:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to I was planning on doing
 
05:05:49.708 --> 05:05:49.718 align:start position:0%
EXA I want to make sure you guys have we
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%

05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
session on a number of bills I haven't
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%

05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
bills we heard today the bill on
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%

05:06:10.230 --> 05:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
bill in a subcommittee
 
05:06:12.628 --> 05:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
um relative to density requirements in
 
05:06:12.638 --> 05:06:14.190 align:start position:0%

05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
committee seen that we heard that you
 
05:06:20.910 --> 05:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
think a work session will that we have

not yet disposed of that you think a
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:30.430 --> 05:06:30.440 align:start position:0%

today parking and the other density one
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
