00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
mischievousness and at two o'clock in
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
the morning my bubby used to say
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
the smart ones always have trouble
 
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.070 align:start position:0%
the smart ones always have trouble
sleeping

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
sleeping
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
kathy reminded me a lot of my bubbie
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
one of a kind her own person
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
all day every day unforgettable
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
you can tell right away when you meet a
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
strong woman the kind of woman that
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't suffer fools
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
we would vetch to each other for hours
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
into the night we were both
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
unapologetic when we maybe should have
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
been more reflective and alternatively
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
should have been sorry yet finding
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves apologizing for the things
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
that weren't our fault
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
kathy had an individual superpower she
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
would never miss a meeting or a chance
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
to defend stand up for and fight for the
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable and when she stood up
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
she would win every single time i never
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
met a legislator in the state house that
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
didn't respect kathy rogers work her
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
ethic her institutional knowledge and
 
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
ethic her institutional knowledge and
tenacity

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
tenacity
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
kathy was a lifelong democrat with an
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
arm extended in cooperation and
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
friendship across the aisle
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
i am so lucky to have counted kathy as
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
one of my mentors she was more than just
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
a good teacher
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
we grew so close to be friends and she
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
was truly an amazing individual
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
like many of my mentors know she would
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
always try to give me advice but i would
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
never listen this would of course elicit
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
a solid eye roll and a sigh with well i
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
guess you have to learn the hard way
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't you she would tell me many times
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
that she was more misbehaved than i was
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
i understand i would do the same thing
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
when i was your age she said back there
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
there wasn't the internet you have to be
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
better than me be better try harder
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
kathy never sugarcoated anything when
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
you messed up she would tell you to your
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
face and she could be bruisingly blunt
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
her feedback sometimes left her
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
left your self-confidence shaking but
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
you always knew she was right
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
she was constantly looking out for me
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
and had my back even when it wasn't
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
popular to do so
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
cathy was one of those people that you
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
don't complain to
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
unless you have a real problem you never
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to waste her time on frivolous
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
things or small issues this was the kind
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
of woman that would save the world and
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
make it her responsibility to clean up
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
the entirety of any mess even though
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
that mess hadn't been created by her
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
kathy was a true advocate her joy came
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
from service in saving vulnerable people
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
animals and even trees
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
anyone who had cursory introduction to
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
her would know all creatures great and
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
small occupied a big piece of her heart
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
this lady was always there for the fight
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
even at the expense of her own life
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
she fought all the way until the end
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
if it had been up to her she would have
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
preferred to pass away while we were in
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
session or during some other important
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
meeting that she never missed because
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
kathy never missed a moment
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
promise me she said the other day on her
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
deathbed promise me you will keep
 
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.470 align:start position:0%
deathbed promise me you will keep
fighting

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
fighting
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't stop what we do is too important
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
and you have to promise me you will
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
never give up
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
i nodded yes i promise i won't give up
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
as cassie as kathy laid there in her
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
hospital bed making me promise that we
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
would all continue our service and that
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
we would never quit it was not lost on
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
me that the fight continues in many
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
forms of service if even if we are not
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
in office it does not mean that we
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
cannot change the world and the world
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
has a lot of changing to do
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
because we're all fighters she said i'd
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
like to think that we don't just give up
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
if you are a true friend to the
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
honorable katherine rogers you know
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what keeping a promise means
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
i had the honor of traveling to the end
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
of the road with kathy she left us
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
surrounded by love
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
and she left squeezing the very last out
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
of life she didn't waste any of her
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
moments so i'd like to leave you with
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
this message no matter how hard it gets
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
no matter how sorry you feel for
 
00:24:59.679 --> 00:25:00.710 align:start position:0%
no matter how sorry you feel for
yourself

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
don't quit because somewhere someplace
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
kathy is watching you and if there's one
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
thing you don't want it's to be on that
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
woman's bad side
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
kathy i love you thank you for sharing
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
conciliatory thought for me and all of
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
this is that you get to meet my bubby
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
and in the back end of my sleepless mind
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
i can hear the mischievous and joyful
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
cackling of two tough extremely
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
intelligent women whose soft hearts had
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
rough edges planting from above cooking
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
as a last alternative that nothing less
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
no lesser type of disposition would be
 
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.750 align:start position:0%
no lesser type of disposition would be
appropriate

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
says that a minor can never be committed
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
for any non-violent crime such as a
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
property crime no matter how serious
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
and how how serious that crime is and it
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
eliminates the three strikes provision
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't matter how many prior
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
adjudications the minor has to just give
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
an example if you're away from the for
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
the weekend or if your business is
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
closed is closed and you're not there so
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
there's no danger of violence to you and
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
somebody breaks in commits a burglary
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
breaks in
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
cleans you out
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
all of your property or destroys your
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
house or whatever
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
under this amendment
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
that minor could not receive one day in
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
commitment even if the minor had
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
committed the same offenses three times
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
previously i should end so
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
this this amendment sends the message
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
that in new hampshire property rights
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't mean very much
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
because if it's if you just commit a
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
property crime there's no possibility no
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
matter how serious it is or how what
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
your prior record is that you that a
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
minor could ever receive any period of
 
00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:44.870 align:start position:0%
minor could ever receive any period of
commitment

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
so stop and think about how does that
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
make sense in light of the sort of smash
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
and grabs that have been going on around
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
i asked one of the primary supporters of
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation if any other state in
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
the country has tried to do something
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
like this and he told me that as far as
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
he knows the only state that has even
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
come close is illinois which which it
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
provides that a minor cannot be
 
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:09.910 align:start position:0%
provides that a minor cannot be
committed

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
committed
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
for misdemeanors but as i say this bill
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
goes for this amendment goes further it
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
says a minor cannot be committed for a
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
non-violent offense even if it's a
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
felony so if they destroy your house
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
steal thousands of dollars of property
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
from your house if there's no violence
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
involved the minor cannot receive any
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a commitment
 
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.270 align:start position:0%
kind of a commitment
um

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
proponents say that this bill will
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the po oh i'm sorry i should may
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
i should mention
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
this bill the amendment contains a
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
subsection m which the proponents refer
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
to as the judicial bypass
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
that does allow commitment
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
for a felony for any felony but again
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
it contains a limitation that the that
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
in order for there to be a commitment
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
the minor has to pose a danger of
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury so again it sends
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
the message that unless the minor is a
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
danger of a you know of some kind of
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
violence hurting you physically if
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're just a pr just a thief no matter
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
how long or how serious their record is
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
no possible commitment what kind of
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
message does that set more importantly
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
stop and think about this
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
if there's no possibility that a judge
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
could impose a sentence of commitment or
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
a property offense
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
even when a judge wants to impose a
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
lesser sentence probation
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
counseling treatment or whatever there
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
are some minors who are resistant to
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
that and unless the judge has the stick
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
of being able to say if you don't do
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
these things you're going to jail or
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to to a juvenile commitment
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
facility what's the incentive
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
of of the minor to do to to comply with
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
those things i submit that that for some
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
miners there's just no incentive at all
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
some you know
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
based at least on my experience not all
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
miners are you know there's so there are
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
some that are that can be pretty
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
hardened and that's unfortunate but it's
 
00:50:10.559 --> 00:50:11.349 align:start position:0%
hardened and that's unfortunate but it's
true

00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
so i should say to you
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
um the proponents of this bill have said
 
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
um the proponents of this bill have said
that

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
this will reduce the population of the
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
sununu center which we all favor we all
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
think that's a good idea but i have to
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
but i what i submit to you is
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
that that's already the case the
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
population has already been reduced
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
under existing law as i the last that i
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
checked the population of the sununu
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
center was roughly 10 to 15 people about
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
half are in pre-trial uh detention and
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
half are submitted are are serving a
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
committed uh disposition but the so the
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
center has already the population has
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
already been reduced
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
i support closing the sununu center and
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
building a new facility and that's why i
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
support the underlying bill
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
458 but this amendment goes too far
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's true that commitment of a minor for
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
a property crime should happen only
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
rarely i completely agree with that
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
but this amendment says never
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
it can never happen and that's the
 
00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.390 align:start position:0%
it can never happen and that's the
problem

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.910 align:start position:0%
problem
uh

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
so that's for those reasons i ask you to
 
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.510 align:start position:0%
so that's for those reasons i ask you to
vote

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
press the red button vote against this
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
amendment so that the underlying bill
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
without amendment may then be passed
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much does the member
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question i
 
00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm predisposed to voting right on
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
this as you've uh asked us to
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
but i would like to understand something
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
the juvenile justice system was set up
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
so that indiscretions
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
of poor judgment in your youth
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
can be dealt with without a permanent
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
scar in your record what i what i'm
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
wondering is if we create
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
such an exclusive blanket prohibition
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
against incarcerating
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
all property crimes
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
essentially asking the courts
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
to try many more of these juveniles as
 
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.349 align:start position:0%
to try many more of these juveniles as
adults

00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
adults
 
00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:22.549 align:start position:0%
adults
thereby

00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
thereby
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
messing up their record the rest of
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
their life that's what i'm worried about
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
is there an unintended consequence of
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
diverting these kids into the adult
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative edwards and you raise an
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
excellent point and i would ask though
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
those who may be disposed to vote for
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment i would ask you to think
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
about the unintended consequences
 
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.710 align:start position:0%
about the unintended consequences
because

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.510 align:start position:0%
because
this

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
passing this amendment will take away
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
the op an important option
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
of a judge in a case where we're
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
involving a property crime where the
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
judge feels that this is a serious
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
enough situation that some commitment
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
towards to a secure facility is required
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
but but the the the minor should i and i
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
should when i say a judge it also would
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
require a prosecutor but where they they
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
believe that some commitment is required
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
but that the but that the we shouldn't
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
go so far as to invoke the adult
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
criminal system where a person if it is
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
if a person is petitioned as treated as
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
an adult and is committed and is found
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
guilty then the person goes to an adult
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
jail if you take away this option
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
for that that class of cases that i've
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
just described it seems to me you make
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
it more likely the unintended
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
consequence will be
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
more prosecutors will say well my only
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
op this person should be committed for
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
some period of time but i can't do it
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
under the juvenile statute the only
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
option i have is to petition the court
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
to have this person treated as an adult
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think we want that
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
so i i think you raise an excellent
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
question representative edwards does the
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
member yield to further questions
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
i do
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you for
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question under the amendment
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
it says under part two adds placement of
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
children who are quote not serious
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
violent offenders
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
unquote is there do you know of any
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
definition in statute or in common law
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
or the new hampshire supreme court has a
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
clear definition of serious violent
 
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.829 align:start position:0%
clear definition of serious violent
offenders

00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
offenders
 
00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:28.710 align:start position:0%
offenders
i

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
i
can't

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
i can't think of a case off hand but i
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
think that uh you know i think i don't
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that there's a
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
definition in statute that has that you
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
know serious violent offender means i i
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's such a
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
definition in statute i you know i think
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
probably the court
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know a court could construe that
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
pretty easily to say has to have a uh
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
it has to be a violent offense
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
and has to involve
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
some level of violence
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
does the member yield a further question
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes so potentially under the bill
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
depending on how the courts later
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
interpret it uh someone a group of 16
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
and 17 year olds might commit a home
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
burglary or even steal a car
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
if there was some intent later on to
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
commit some other violent crime if the
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutor doesn't have evidence of that
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to detain them or
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
if they don't have evidence sufficient
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
evidence that they can introduce in
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
court does that mean that the uh
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
the courts would have just another vague
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
area or gray area where they wouldn't
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
know whether they could detain them or
 
00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:32.870 align:start position:0%
know whether they could detain them or
not

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
if to he said i uh if i if i understand
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
your question correctly as i think that
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
if the state of the evidence was such
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
that the only charge that could be
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
brought was for a property crime and
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
there was not there was no evidence that
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
the mine that the miner was you know
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
physically violent or a physical danger
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
the answer would be no the minor could
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
not be committed
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
either for that crime
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
even if the minor had you know
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
three or four or five or ten
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh prior
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh commitments
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i guess i wore the
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the further
 
00:56:13.359 --> 00:56:14.630 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the further
questions

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank the
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
member for taking my question
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
if i hear you correctly um would it be
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
correct then to assume that if a house
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
is vacant and a miner commits arson and
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
burns that house to the ground
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
and even if they become a serial
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
arsonist and burn houses that are vacant
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
to the ground there's no way to put them
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
no i believe and i and i stand to be
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
corrected if for people that are
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
proponents of this amendment i don't
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
think it would cover i think arson would
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
be it is
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
is uh uh an offense for which someone
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
could be committed because that that
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be considered to be burning down a
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
building would be considered i believe
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
well it's a i think it and it's it's a
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
felony that's specifically listed in the
 
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.789 align:start position:0%
felony that's specifically listed in the
bill

00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
purely a purely a property cri theft
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
type of property crime
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
even if it's a felony even if the person
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
has you know a significant prior record
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
of that could not be the basis for a
 
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.069 align:start position:0%
of that could not be the basis for a
commitment

00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize that we were
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
encouraging about locking kids in prison
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
did you know that when an adult commits
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor we don't just throw them
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
in jail they put on probation or they
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
let go they pay bail
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think we uh
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
heard many bills this session about bail
 
00:57:59.839 --> 00:58:04.150 align:start position:0%
heard many bills this session about bail
reform

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
this bill that we're talking about
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
is building a new facility
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment intends to reduce the
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
population of the current facility
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
we are spending 13 million dollars a
 
00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:29.030 align:start position:0%
we are spending 13 million dollars a
year

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
on a
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
144 bed facility
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you the population
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
what are the unintended consequences for
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
kids i'll tell you i've been there
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
i've lived in that facility i have lived
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
in group homes
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
group homes
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
are community-based services
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
most of the kids in group homes
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
have had a felony
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
juvenile diversion programs
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
you have to follow a plan
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
that your jppo which for those in this
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
room don't know is a juvenile probation
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
parole officer
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
puts in place for you and you have to
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
follow that to a t
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
in these programs kids are required to
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
follow a plan
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
and the system
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
is set up for youth to have success
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
setting kids up for success
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
if the intent is to just lock kids up
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
for any crime that they may commit
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
we might as well throw this whole thing
 
00:59:44.559 --> 00:59:45.510 align:start position:0%
we might as well throw this whole thing
out

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
throw it out the window it's got a
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
pretty far fall
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
and keep that 144 bed 13 million dollars
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
a year facility
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
instead of keep teaching kids that if
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
you commit a crime you're going to
 
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.390 align:start position:0%
you commit a crime you're going to
prison

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
prison
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
let's teach them that their mistakes are
 
01:00:06.799 --> 01:00:09.030 align:start position:0%
let's teach them that their mistakes are
mistakes

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that tomorrow is a new day
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
because in fact they are kids
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
and they're short-term
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
they don't understand the consequences
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
studies have proven this
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
for that i ask that you support
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
with me the committee amendment
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we have worked incredibly hard for
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
so that we can move on with the rest of
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested is that
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
question before us
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%

the house will come to water
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative lin
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
know that this amendment
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
20 2022 1470 contains overbroad and
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
inaccurate legislative findings which
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
are totally unnecessary to the substance
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the legislation and if i know that
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment contains two sections
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
that is five and six
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh which propose inconsistent amendments
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the same provision of existing law
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
and if i know most importantly that this
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
amendment would prohibit committing a
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
minor to a secure youth detention
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
facility for a property crime that does
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
not involve violence or the threat of
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
violence that the minor is a danger to
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
public safety no matter how serious the
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
crime or how many times the minor has
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
committed similar crimes in the past and
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
would effectively announce to the public
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
that in new hampshire violation of
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
property rights is no big deal then
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
would i press the red button to defeat
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
this amendment so that the underlying
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
jail recognizes representative d simone
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
that there is some confusion
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
concerning whether to detain
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
or commit youth to a facility
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
if i know that in this
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful state
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.829 align:start position:0%
 
commit

01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%

01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%

to a prison facility
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
when they commit a misdemeanor
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
so why are we
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
committing youth
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
when they commit a misdemeanor
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
that's very confusing to me
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
that this amendment
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
speaks to the necessities
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
to keep youth
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
and the inhabitants of this state safe
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
then would i press
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the majority
 
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:53.320 align:start position:0%

under an 82 voting a 150 voting a

01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
the house has rejected uh my view that
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
the that the prior amendment should not
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
be adopted i accept your judgment i i
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
offer amen the um the amendment now
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
before you floor amendment uh
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
as a fallback position that i submit
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
will make the current bill better
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
let me tell you what it does it
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
basically does four things first
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
it removes over broad and incomplete
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislative findings which are totally
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to the substance of the bill
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
second it replaces sections five and six
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
of amendment 1470 that's the one you
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
just passed
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
which both address the same topic of
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
pre-trial adjudication
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication detention and are
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with each other it just
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
adopts one of them it basically says and
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
i completely agree with proponents of
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
the bill you shouldn't be able to detain
 
01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.150 align:start position:0%
the bill you shouldn't be able to detain
somebody

01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication if they couldn't be
 
01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:21.430 align:start position:0%
pre-adjudication if they couldn't be
committed

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
committed
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know at following an adjudication
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what my amendment does
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
three most important
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
it changes the new proposed section m of
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
the of the amendment you just passed
 
01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.270 align:start position:0%
the of the amendment you just passed
um

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
which is an amendment to rsa 169 b19 one
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
roman numeral one
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
to allow a court to impose commitment to
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%

deposition

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
deposition
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
a disposition not only in cases where
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
the minor poses a risk of serious bodily
 
01:07:52.319 --> 01:07:53.190 align:start position:0%

injury
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
but also where the minor poses a
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
substantial risk of significant property
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%

01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
where because of the seriousness of the
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
conduct the commitment is an appropriate
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
sentence under all the circumstances
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
lastly my amendment also slightly
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
changes the wording of subparagraph m
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
so that while the court must find the
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
facts supporting commitment
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
by clear and convincing evidence based
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
upon reliable uh
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
reliable evidence it is not required to
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
comply with the formal rules of evidence
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
remember this will be a sentencing
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
proceeding and i
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
this may be a little bit inside baseball
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
but in sentencing proceedings courts are
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
the courts are not required to comply
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
with the rules of evidence to make the
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence applicable in this one
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
case would be would make it very
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
difficult and very time consuming and
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
more add more cost
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
to the disposition of these cases i
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge you to press the green
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
button to uh adopt this amendment and mr
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
speaker i'd ask for a division vote
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
does the member yield to questions
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.510 align:start position:0%
taking the question
so

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
is my understanding correct that under
 
01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.189 align:start position:0%
is my understanding correct that under
the

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
language if we did not adopt this
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
a high schooler could spend all four
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
years of their high school going from
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
car dealership to car dealership bashing
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
in every single car
 
01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:27.349 align:start position:0%
in every single car
um

01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
a night
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
and your amendment
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
without ever being committed
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
but your amendment would allow some
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
discretion to the judge to be able to
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
commit that person
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the for the question
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative yes the answer is that my
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
amendment would allow that again it
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
would still have to be a last resort the
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
judge would have to find it by clear and
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that this
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
that commitment was the only appropriate
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
disposition and that nothing less
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
restrictive was appropriate but yes it
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
could could impose commitment in that
 
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.550 align:start position:0%
could could impose commitment in that
circumstance

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's a member yield of further questions
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
generally sooner you may inquire
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you for
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question so this language just
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't overturn the last amendment that
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
the house proposed it just tries to
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
provide some clarification so that there
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
are certain circumstances if for example
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
if someone's going to has committed a
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
property crime and then might commit
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
other uh serious crimes uh that the
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
judge might have just some discretion to
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's correct the
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
amendment that you just passed has a
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
adds a new subsection m to the law which
 
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
creates a sort of judicial override the
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
problem with the one in my view and the
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
one with the one you just passed is it
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
allows the judicial override only if the
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
poses a threat of serious bodily injury
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
my amendment says
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
that it can be
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
you can have the override if the if the
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
if the miner poses a spread of serious
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
bodily injury but also if the miner
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
poses a risk of
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
substantial risk of significant property
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
damage or loss
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
or if given the seriousness of the of
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
the conduct the court concludes that
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's the only appropriate disposition
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
under all the circumstances then it
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
would allow the court to have the
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
for the record hb 254
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
which is what this is attempting to
 
01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.590 align:start position:0%
which is what this is attempting to
amend

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
amend
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh was passed by this body on january
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
there was an attempt
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
to table that bill
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
and it failed overwhelmingly
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
now before us today is an attempt to
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
but it was never brought before the
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have its day
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the hearing that's why we have it
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
before you today
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment is dangerous
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
for years
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislatives that as legislators that
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
have sat in the seats before us
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
have worked diligently to reduce the
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
population of sysc that is why today you
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
have a population of 15 and not 144 bets
 
01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:47.910 align:start position:0%
have a population of 15 and not 144 bets
filled

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
that is attached to this bill to build a
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
new youth center
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
and if this amendment passes
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
you might as well again throw it out the
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
window start over and let's fill those
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
bets i'm against that
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
let's move on
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
support the uh do not support this
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
amendment with me
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
and let's stop wasting taxpayer dollars
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
on the current facility
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested this will
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
be a division vote members take your
 
01:13:25.679 --> 01:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
be a division vote members take your
seats

01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is floor amendment
 
01:14:31.679 --> 01:14:34.790 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is floor amendment
1640

01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote the chair
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative lynn for a
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
know that there had that there was never
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
back in january or at any other time an
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed like this amendment
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
that is now before you
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this amendment
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
removes the overbroad and inaccurate
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
legislative findings which are now
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
contained in the bill as amended as you
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
just amended it and which are totally
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to the substance of the bill
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this olympic this
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
amendment eliminates one of the two
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent provisions contained in the
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
amendment you just passed so that the
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill will simply state that a minor
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
cannot be detained in a secure facility
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
for any offence for which the sentence
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
of for which a sentence of commitment to
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
such a facility could not be imposed
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the i the notion that
 
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.709 align:start position:0%
that the i the notion that
adults

01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
adults
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
are never sentenced to jail for
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors is a fantasy i sentence
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
awful lot of in people to jail for
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and i know a lot of my
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues did the same thing that's

01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
in this body we spent a lot of time
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
talking about property rights and our
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
discussion of the last bill actually
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
veered into property rights as well
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to how property is
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
divided between unmarried people who
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
live together and then split up
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
our laws are unclear and they have gaps
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
as we heard in the public hearing on
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
this bill this lack of clarity opens the
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
door to one party being able to take
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of the other financially when
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
the relationship ends
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
retirement assets that normally would be
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
split between a divorcing couple
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
remain in the hands of the cohabiting
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
partner who controls the account
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
domestic partner health care coverage
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
can simply be canceled after the split
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
meanwhile in new hampshire the death of
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
one partner after less than three years
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
of living together can leave the
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
surviving partner with nothing
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
unless provisions were made in the will
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
as for child custody laws the good news
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
is they apply to both married as well as
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
unmarried couples
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
but the bad news is when the split
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
involves unmarried people
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
one partner may have to take on the
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
burden of paying for child activities
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
and other expenses with no financial
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
help from the other
 
01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
we are living in a society that's slowly
 
01:23:32.239 --> 01:23:33.590 align:start position:0%
we are living in a society that's slowly
changing

01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
according to a recent study by the
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
university
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
unmarried couples today are living
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
together for longer periods than in the
 
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.709 align:start position:0%
together for longer periods than in the
past

01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
but fewer of these relationships are
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
leading to marriage
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
that means in the years to come
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
we're only going to be seeing more of
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
these issues cropping up
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
when unmarried people do things like buy
 
01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.310 align:start position:0%
when unmarried people do things like buy
houses

01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%

01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
is not to propose or impose some sort of
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
a shot in the dark solution or to impose
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%

the mission of this bill is to do one
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
thing and that that's to do one of our
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
most important jobs as legislators

it's to bring in experts it's to take a
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
close look at our laws including a very
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
relevant rsa that goes back to a time
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
when women in new hampshire weren't even
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to own property
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
and then decide if making changes make
 
01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.270 align:start position:0%
and then decide if making changes make
sense

01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
while i know that this particular
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislature seems to have no love at all
 
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
for study committees
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
it has shown a definite and deep
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
affinity for protecting property rights
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
and that's really what we're talking
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
about here
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
i urge you to keep showing that affinity
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
and devote red on the motion before us
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
so another motion can be made and i ask
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
for a division vote thank you
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr speaker
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
i rise in support of the committee's
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation of inexpensive
 
01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.870 align:start position:0%
recommendation of inexpensive
legislative

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 291
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
none of the issues presented to the
 
01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.910 align:start position:0%
none of the issues presented to the
committee

01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
addressed any areas of law that had that
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
weren't already well settled under new
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire law
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
the issue of common law marriage
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
has already been settled
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
the issue of the different ways people
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
can own property
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
what this would do is they want to study
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
those laws
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
which it appears that many people
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
already did
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
and come to the conclusion that they're
 
01:26:00.159 --> 01:26:01.030 align:start position:0%
and come to the conclusion that they're
already

01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
well settled
 
01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:03.669 align:start position:0%
well settled
if

01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
two people living together
 
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.189 align:start position:0%
two people living together
it's

01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
their choice whether they wish to get
 
01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.550 align:start position:0%
their choice whether they wish to get
married

01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
married
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
if they don't want to get married or one
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
people living together does not want to
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why that would we need to
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
study on how that would impact their
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
property rights if people are unmarried
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
and choose to buy property together
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
whether to own an equal shares as joint
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
tenants or
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
to own an unequal share that's their
 
01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.470 align:start position:0%
to own an unequal share that's their
decision

01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
these are all issues that can be
 
01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
addressed already under the law
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
common law marriages
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
which have been abolished in the state
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
for good reason
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
because people who would live together
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
what would happen is
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
20 years later if one of those when
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're not living together that other
 
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
person can remarry and what would happen
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
is the person who lived with that person
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
20 years ago says oh i was married to
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
that person and they claim her right to
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
their estate
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
more than i can even calculate
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
clogging up the courts more than they're
 
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
already clogged up
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm not really sure what needed to be
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
studied that is not already well
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
concluded under the law
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
the although i sympathize with some of
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
the testimony presented to the committee
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
the issue was raised again
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
a consultation with
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
a any attorney anyone with legal
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
background would have been able to
 
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
advise that person of what their rights
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
were for that reason
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
i would ask that you join me push the
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
green button and support the committee's
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%

bye

01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
is the majority report of inexpedient to
 
01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.750 align:start position:0%
is the majority report of inexpedient to
legislate

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
i rise to oppose the itl recommendation
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
property rights are among the most
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
sacred and important rights
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
and if i know the existing laws that
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
govern the division of property in these
 
01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.430 align:start position:0%
govern the division of property in these
cases

01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
lack clarity when unmarried
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
relationships end between cohabitants
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
and par domestic partnerships
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
and that this lack of clarity can result
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
in the loss of property should one of
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
the parties take advantage of the other
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
passing this law would solve that
 
01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.709 align:start position:0%
passing this law would solve that
problem

01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
through further study of how the legal
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
clarity that these cases require can be
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
incorporated into existing laws
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button to
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
defeat the itl recommendation
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
so an ought to pass motion can be made

persons choosing not to become married
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%

comfortable if a couple is uncomfortable
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
with becoming married they have the
 
01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
right to keep all of their assets
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
separate just as a married couple does
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that if a
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
couple is if that a married couple is
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
just as vulnerable to have their account
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
liquidated as a married couple and this
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
could all be solved with a will
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%

01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they can fix that um
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
they spoke of
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
the person getting 60 days in jail
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
on this really really
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
and i mean really bad accident
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know the person should have got a
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
lot more
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
but there was other laws that could have
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
got him more
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the county attorney and
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
the person that caused this accident
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
it was the plea deal's fault that he
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
days also during testimony mr speaker
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
and i asked them about if your cell
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
phone is in the cradle
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
and you use it
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
can you be fined under this new
 
01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.709 align:start position:0%
can you be fined under this new
law

01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
just by using hands-free
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know well i guess it's not
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
hands-free because you're touching it
 
01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:24.229 align:start position:0%
hands-free because you're touching it
but

01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.629 align:start position:0%
 
whoa

01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
whoa
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
that that's a red flag for me mr speaker
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
the state police also mr speaker said
 
01:35:35.199 --> 01:35:37.030 align:start position:0%
the state police also mr speaker said
that

01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
there are other laws like negligent
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
driving distracted driving that would
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
get that person that caused this
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
terrible terrible accident
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
more jail time
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
and that's really what this bill is
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
after is to
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
that if there's a real bad accident
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
that you are punished but we have
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that really bothers
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
me mr speaker on this bill
 
01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.030 align:start position:0%
me mr speaker on this bill
is

01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
i was coming up through the tolls coming
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
to the state house this was uh you know
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker there was a woman putting
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
her makeup on
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm going whoa okay that's nice
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
and as i'm driving up the road another
 
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.790 align:start position:0%
and as i'm driving up the road another
time

01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
there's a guy with a full newspaper
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
spread right out
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking well that's nice
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
i see it constantly
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i asked
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
one of the officers
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
because bottom line when i drive down
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
the road i see a lot of people on their
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
cell phones
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
you know holding them right there
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
and they shouldn't
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
i i'll be honest i don't know how they
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
do it because i would head right in the
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
ditch but people
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
must learn how to do it and they do it
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
and when i'm i'm in manchester a lot
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
and also in goffstown i've never seen a
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
goffstown police do it but i've seen
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
plenty of manchester police texting why
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're driving or looking at their cell
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
phones or their computers in the
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county sheriff's i see it
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm going well okay so who's going
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
to enforce this if they're doing it
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know mr speaker it's just you know
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
they should have included everything if
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
they were going to do this and i'd
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
probably still be against it
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
but bottom line
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire liberty alliance
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
and i just look at it mr speaker
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
they're only picking on cell phones in
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
the person that caused this accident
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
could have got a lot more jail time
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
they pled a deal and that's why he only
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
got 60
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
days so
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully you'll vote with me and mr
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
speaker ever since i'm way in the back i
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if you would hear me but i
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
would like a roll call on this
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.629 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker remember yield to
questions

01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:45.590 align:start position:0%
questions
yes

01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%

01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%

speaker and thank you for taking my
 
01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:52.870 align:start position:0%
speaker and thank you for taking my
question

01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh is the mic off i can't hear you
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
so my question is am i reading this
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
right on the gold standard that it says
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
that this could increase this to a class
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
a felony up to 15-year jail term
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
for using a cell phone is this correct
 
01:39:17.199 --> 01:39:18.870 align:start position:0%
for using a cell phone is this correct
yes

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
remember yield to further questions yes
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
isn't it so
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
that negligent or even reckless
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
vehicular homicide is only a class b
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
felony so if you if you're driving
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
recklessly and you kill someone without
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
a cell phone that's only a class b
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
felony but
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
just driving with a cell phone could
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
raise it to a class a felony if you
 
01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
don't cause an accident correct and
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's why this bill is is not you know
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
it wasn't thawed out they were just
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
after that one person to punish that one
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
person which is already spent 60 days in
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
jail so there's no punishing him and i
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
mean i feel really bad for that lady
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
that spoke in front of us i mean it was
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
it was a horrific accident and you know
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
just thank god she's still alive because
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason she is
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay one for their follow-up remember
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
yields further question
 
01:40:05.119 --> 01:40:06.070 align:start position:0%
yields further question
um

01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
was it your committee when the new
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire civil liberties union came in
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
and they they said something that was a
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
that was important they said uh bad
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
cases make for bad law in other words
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
taking one specific case where the law
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
was misapplied
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh in in one particular narrow
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance um that we tend to pass the
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislatures around the country tend to
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
pass bad laws based on a single case
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
where the the court system didn't
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
operate properly was that your committee
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
was that the criminal justice committee
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
where they've said that
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
yes and that's what this bill is
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's we're going to have a bad law
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
here that isn't needed
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
this law is not based on one case
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
we just heard that
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
the good representative sees people on
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
their cell phone all the time
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
this law does not make a felon out of
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
you for using a cell phone this law is
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
very specific
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
drink and drive and cause an accident or
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
cause an accident and it is revealed in
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
the investigation that you did it
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
because you were using your cell phone
 
01:41:17.679 --> 01:41:18.470 align:start position:0%
because you were using your cell phone
then

01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
the enhanced penalty would apply
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
because one woman was brave enough to
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
come in and testify does not mean that
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
this is about one person
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
the woman who came in and testified has
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
had seven or eight surgeries her entire
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
life has been changed she lost her
 
01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.590 align:start position:0%
life has been changed she lost her
career

01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
career
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
and she had a son with down syndrome who
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
she didn't know who should be able to
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
take care of because somebody thought it
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
was more important to send a text than
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the road
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
again very clear this is not enhancing
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
the use of cell phone crimes this is
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
enhancing the use
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
of cell phone while you get in an
 
01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.990 align:start position:0%
of cell phone while you get in an
accident

01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
accident
 
01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:58.870 align:start position:0%
accident
or

01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
your oui already serious offenses
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
and it's also not a mandatory it just
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
gives the court the option to send it to
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
you at a higher rate
 
01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:09.830 align:start position:0%
you at a higher rate
and

01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
frankly if you can't put your
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
cell phone aside and you cause someone
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
to almost die or die
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
i think we would agree that you deserve
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
a higher rate of sentencing
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
burgess requested a roll call is that
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the committee
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%

mr speaker
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
that the person could have got more jail
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i also know
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
that the state police
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
that testified is unaware is not sure
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
that if you use your hands free if that
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
constitute a crime
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
if i know there is plenty of other
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
distracted drive-in that is not included
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%

01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
if i know that senate bill 306
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
gives the prosecutor the discretion to
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
seek an enhanced penalty when there's
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
egregious circumstances
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
with a current penalty under the law
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
does not fit the crime
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i know
 
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
that the scope of senate bill 306 only
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
would apply to mobile electronic devices
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
that are not if they're not permanently
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%

01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
when this is an ominous bill which most
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
of us are against because they packed a
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff in here
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
there is some good stuff
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
that i'm not opposed to but the main
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
thing that i'm opposed to
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
is our privacy
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
i talked well i
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
asked questions to the dot gentleman
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
that testified in front of
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
us and in the bill it says that they
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
have to delete
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is about dash cam so they're going
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
and even though
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
the hra is against it there's part of me
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
that says you know what dash cam is
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
because there's accidents in
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know that they need
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know this this uh
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
tape if there was an accident
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
but where the problem is because the way
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
the d.o.t has to delete the tape in
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
three days
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
so i asked
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
well that three days can some another
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
government agency come in and grab that
 
01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
government agency come in and grab that
tape

01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
tape
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
and he said yes
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm like whoa we can't do that
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's not right
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
and then he said
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
we could even take the tape and use it
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
for training or commercials or anything
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why in my blurb mr speaker and
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
is because
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
on november 6
 
01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.709 align:start position:0%
on november 6
2018

01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand four hundred and
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
nine thousand three hundred and twenty
 
01:49:37.599 --> 01:49:39.270 align:start position:0%
nine thousand three hundred and twenty
five

01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire or 81 percent
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
past cacr 16.
 
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
and let me tell you what it said
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
cacr16 a yes vote supported
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment to provide that
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
individuals have a right to live free
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
from government intrusion in private
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
or personal information
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
while me driving down the road getting
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
caught on the camera of a d.o.t truck
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
like i said if they deleted the tape and
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
nobody else could get it just like at
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
the uh tolls when you go through there
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
they delete them within you know a short
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
i could support that
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
but when another government agency can
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
come in and grab that tape
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
and use it for whatever they want
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
i'm against that
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
because it is against the constitutional
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that both sides voted
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
also mr speaker the hra is against this
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
and they quoted let me quote it for you
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
or they i'm going to quote them
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
the bill is also permitting the
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
department of transportation to operate
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
constitution part one article two dash b
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
right of privacy so it's even in
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know the constitution which we
 
01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:10.629 align:start position:0%
you know the constitution which we
passed

01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
so mr speaker i hope people will see
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
that and not see some of the good in
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
there and say you know what we have to
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
kill the bill because that's the only
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
right thing to do
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
because mr speaker lastly new hampshire
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
voters were very clear on november 6
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
2018 when we did pass cacr16
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
they do not want government
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
surveilling us
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
they do believe in privacy
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
and we voted for that
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
over 80 percent of new hampshire people
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
wanted this
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker remember yield to
 
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:51.270 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker remember yield to
questions

01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
yes or no yes
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
remember yields
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you for
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question i've been reading
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
this uh the different blurbs on this i
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
understand the body
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
worn cameras by the police department in
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
need because of what's been going on in
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
the call across the country in the last
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
couple of years but i'm i don't see any
 
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
reason nor do i understand what it is
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
why does the department of
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
transportation need
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
dash cams we've been doing quite well
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
without a mother i understand there's
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
some big reason out there that we all of
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
a sudden have to put dash cams on
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
department of transportation vehicles
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know they showed us pictures of you
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
know it's only once or twice a year of
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
accidents that when cars fly down the
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
highway and they smack into a d.o.t
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
truck luckily you know nobody's been
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
hurt seriously
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
so they just want that video of the
 
01:52:41.679 --> 01:52:45.669 align:start position:0%
so they just want that video of the
accident

01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognized
 
01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:53.589 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognized
representative

01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
i rise in support of the committee's
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation about to pass for senate
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill 401
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
in respect to the right to privacy
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
which we all enjoy
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
has traditionally always always applied
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
when the person or the individual has a
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
i don't need to give examples of when
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the dot vehicles that we're talking
 
01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.030 align:start position:0%
with the dot vehicles that we're talking
about

01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
they are vehicles that are
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
driving on the highway
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
which is a public way
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's really open to the public
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore i'm not sure what if any
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy a person would
 
01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:40.390 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy a person would
have

01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
for operating
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
a vehicle
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
in public
 
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
police officers have dashboard cameras
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
and they have no they're now starting to
 
01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.430 align:start position:0%
and they have no they're now starting to
use

01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
body cameras as well
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
senate bill 401 will
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
increase the grant money that we
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
actually passed it was part of hb2
 
01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:04.550 align:start position:0%
actually passed it was part of hb2
already

01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
local communities could actually apply
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
for those and receive some funding
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
towards facilitating that program at the
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
local level
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
it's about privacy again we're talking
 
01:54:18.639 --> 01:54:19.589 align:start position:0%
it's about privacy again we're talking
about

01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
something in public
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
now i understand
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
one of the parliamentary rules is we're
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
not supposed to debate witnesses who
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
testify for the committee so when a
 
01:54:29.199 --> 01:54:30.149 align:start position:0%
testify for the committee so when a
witness

01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
witness
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
makes a statement that i
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
strongly disagree with
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
such as i can just get a copy of this
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
video for any reason i want and give it
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
to wherever i want it it would be
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to debate that person but
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
if you read the bill
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
and it's the
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's on the lines 23 to 24 and it's only
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
one page long so i know it was presented
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
as a long builds one page
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
now just read it this
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
the stored recording may only be used by
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
the requesting party for a lawful
 
01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.470 align:start position:0%
the requesting party for a lawful
purpose

01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
including as evidence in a judicial or
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
administrative proceeding
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
if for some reason a government actor
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason would decide
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to get a copy of a
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
dashboard camera video
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
from the d.o.t that
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason just showed a
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle driving by
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
and they then attempted to use that to
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
well unless they demonstrate a lawful
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
purpose they have no use for it and it
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
was a complete waste of their time in
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
the government's time
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
so again it's only can be obtained by a
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
lawful purpose there's a three-day
 
01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:34.149 align:start position:0%
lawful purpose there's a three-day
period

01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
in order for a right to know request
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
to be submitted by the public if it's
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
not retained if there's no retention
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
period the problem is it's nothing more
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
than a live video feed
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
so there has to be some type of
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
retention period in order to actually
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
make the request
 
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
with that being said i'll get to the
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
positive sides of this
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
one of the parts of this bill that it
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
would offer over 30 it will offer 36
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars to local communities
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
who have
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%

projects

01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%

infrastructure projects
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%

01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
priority of need by those municipalities
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%

01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
here i recognize representative for
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
on november 6 2018 over 400
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
000 people
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
voted and passed cacr16
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
which would allow privacy
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
against the government
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
that in public
 
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
can take pictures videos and everything
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
else they want in public
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
because the supreme court is very clear
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
on that with the first amendment
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
but if i also know mr speaker
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the government
 
01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
does not join that group of the public
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
so they don't have a right to spy
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
and lastly mr speaker
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
if i know the new hampshire voters were
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
very clear on november 6 2018 with the
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
passage of cacr16
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
they do not want government intrusion in
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
their private or personal information as
 
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
the new rsa
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
236 colon 130 subparagraph g
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
would cause
 
02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.070 align:start position:0%
would cause
if

02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%

mr speaker if i know that in this month
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
when we are facing a global
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
environmental crisis and an energy
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
crisis that no ste bills will be heard
 
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
this entire month in this house
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the intergovernmental
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
panel on climate change just issued a
 
02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%

and if i know
 
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
it is unconscionable
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
that this house has not even been
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%

action plan
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%

that while the climate of our planet is
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
certainly changing
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
it is not changing in catastrophic ways
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%

creating a climate action plan
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
was much too broad
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
and would cost our state
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
immense amounts of money
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%

mr speaker
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
if i know that the intergovernmental
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
panel on climate change which is a
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
multinational international body has
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
issued three reports this year regarding
 
02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
the status of the world's climate

can be met by house bill 1506 and mr
 
02:16:39.509 --> 02:16:39.519 align:start position:0%

is an energy accelerator to investigate
 
02:16:44.549 --> 02:16:44.559 align:start position:0%

including hydrogen wind solar battery
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%

pass with amendment recommendation on
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
senate bill 242.
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
current statutes already prohibit all
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
election officials who are candidates
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
for another office from handling marked
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
ballots and counting votes
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
in addition any election official other
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
than the moderator who is a candidate
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
for another office is not allowed to
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
remain within the guard rail during the
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
counting of votes for an office for
 
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
which he is a candidate
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
this bill is amended would now prohibit
 
02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
the moderator if he is a candidate for
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
another office from remaining in the
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
area designated for the counting of
 
02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:28.469 align:start position:0%
area designated for the counting of
votes

02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
votes
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is that this bill is in
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
conflict with the constitution part 2
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
article 32 which directs quote that
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
elections shall be governed by a
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
moderator who shall in the presence of
 
02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
the selectmen receive the votes of the
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
inhabitants of such towns and wards
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
end quote

elections
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
existing statutes require that the
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
moderator assist in processing absentee
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%

closing paperwork and ballot box seals
 
02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
by banning the moderator from the area
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
designated for the counting of votes the
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
bill essentially bans the moderator from
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
the polling place and prevents him from
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
fulfilling the responsibilities he's
 
02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
required to fulfill under the state
 
02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:16.630 align:start position:0%

moderators with years of service and
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
training are critical toward ensuring
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
that our polling sites are efficiently

efficiently and securely
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
we should be trying to keep this
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
experience in place for state and
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
presidential elections not passing a law
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
that will require some of our towns and
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
wards to find substitutes to fill these
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
roles every other year

handling and counting marked ballots
 
02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
sufficiently protects the integrity of
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
elections while allowing moderators to
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
fulfill the responsibilities they were

thank you mr speaker
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill would authorize

a town or city clerk to attach a voter's
 
02:30:00.150 --> 02:30:00.160 align:start position:0%

if i know that by doing so a lot of time
 
02:30:09.910 --> 02:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
will be saved at the polls on election
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
day because election officials will not
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
have to spend time tearing off the

the ballot stays in the sealed affidavit
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%

02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
outer envelope would i then press the

this bill in the name of election
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
integrity establishes affidavit
 
02:34:01.439 --> 02:34:02.630 align:start position:0%
integrity establishes affidavit
balloting

02:34:02.630 --> 02:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
balloting
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
also known as provisional
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
or challenge ballots
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
despite any evidence of any abuse of our
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
existing system under current laws
 
02:34:17.349 --> 02:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
the bill removes the ability of a voter
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
without photo identification
 
02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
to sign an affidavit
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
at the voting place swearing to the
 
02:34:27.590 --> 02:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
voter's address and identity
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
and replaces it with a provisional
 
02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:31.270 align:start position:0%
and replaces it with a provisional
ballot

02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
that is set aside
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
and only counted if the race is close
 
02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
and after going through an ill-defined
 
02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
confirmation process
 
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
which is both
 
02:34:46.150 --> 02:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
expensive and complicated
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
in addition to being a thinly veiled
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
voter suppression effort
 
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
the bill is riddled with serious flaws
 
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
including a question as to whether it
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
violates the new hampshire constitution
 
02:35:01.110 --> 02:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
part 2
 
02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
article 32
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
by adding or subtracting votes
 
02:35:08.790 --> 02:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
after the tally is made by the moderator
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
on election night
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
a second major flaw
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
is that provisional ballots are not
 
02:35:15.439 --> 02:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
is that provisional ballots are not
secret

02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
secret
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
they are assigned a number linking them
 
02:35:20.950 --> 02:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
to the voter
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
the moderator and other voting officials
 
02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
will be able to see the provisional
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
ballot linked to a voter
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore this bill in
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
directly conflicts with new hampshire
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
rsa 656-16
 
02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
which provides that there shall be no
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
impression or mark to distinguish one
 
02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
general election ballot from another
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
under this bill the affidavit is marked
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
by the moderator
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
next the bill endangers new hampshire's
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
exemption from the national voter
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
registration act
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
the loss of which would require an
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
overhaul of our entire voting system
 
02:36:08.309 --> 02:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
with an estimated cost of 6.5 million
 
02:36:08.319 --> 02:36:10.230 align:start position:0%
with an estimated cost of 6.5 million
dollars

02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:36:13.270 --> 02:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
in cities and towns with many new voters
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
the impact of this bill on the voting
 
02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
system will be severe
 
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
requiring additional staff and training
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
for election workers
 
02:36:26.309 --> 02:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
on top of all of this despite the
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
amended time frames in the bill
 
02:36:31.830 --> 02:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
it will be exceedingly difficult if not
 
02:36:34.710 --> 02:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
impossible for the secretary of state to
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
comply with the uniformed and overseas
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
citizens absentee voting act
 
02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
which requires that ballots go out to
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
our service members and their families
 
02:36:49.349 --> 02:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
45 days prior to the election
 
02:36:49.359 --> 02:36:50.550 align:start position:0%
45 days prior to the election
finally

02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
finally
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we have been
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
able to retain the first in the nation
 
02:36:58.630 --> 02:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
primary status is because of same-day
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
registration and the lack of provisional
 
02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:02.630 align:start position:0%
registration and the lack of provisional
ballots

02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
this bill will further endanger our
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
retention of the first in the nation's
 
02:37:07.359 --> 02:37:08.469 align:start position:0%
retention of the first in the nation's
status

02:37:08.469 --> 02:37:08.479 align:start position:0%
status
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
in a close race it will take at least a
 
02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:12.550 align:start position:0%
in a close race it will take at least a
week

02:37:12.550 --> 02:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
to determine a winner
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
because of these seven serious flaws in
 
02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:18.950 align:start position:0%
because of these seven serious flaws in
sb

02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
sb
 
02:37:22.469 --> 02:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
418 the minority opposes the motion of
 
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended thank you
 
02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i rise today again to speak
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
in favor of the majority motion of
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
autopass for senate bill 418.
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
this is an act relative to verification
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
of voter affidavits for verification of
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
voter affidavits today under current law
 
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
anybody can come to new hampshire going
 
02:37:59.429 --> 02:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
into a polling place on election day
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
fill out a same-day registration form
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
put down a local address without any id
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
they can vote as long as they fill out
 
02:38:08.389 --> 02:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
an affidavit form
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
as you know in new hampshire we don't
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
currently require an individual to
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
present any form of identification if
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
you fill out the affidavit form
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
you will
 
02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
you can then leave the polling place or
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
the state for that matter
 
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
and by the time anybody might question
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not the affidavit was valid
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
the election process would be over the
 
02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
vote count complete in any legitimate
 
02:38:34.479 --> 02:38:35.349 align:start position:0%
vote count complete in any legitimate
vote

02:38:35.349 --> 02:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
would not be changed
 
02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
now some will say that it is a burden to
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
have to show an id to vote
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this is 2022
 
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
you need an id to register your car
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
register your dog take money out of the
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
bank buy a house rent a house buy
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
alcohol cigarettes
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
fly on an airplane pick up your kids at
 
02:38:56.950 --> 02:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
daycare and on and on mr speaker would
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
you believe
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
that a bank would not loan you money to
 
02:39:01.270 --> 02:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
buy a car
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
without checking your valid id not even
 
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
and even if you sign an affidavit they
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
still want to see the id
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
this legislation before us as amended is
 
02:39:16.469 --> 02:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
a solution to an overwhelming request
 
02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire citizens to ensure
 
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
that all people voting in new hampshire
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
are doing so as
 
02:39:25.270 --> 02:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
as legal voters in their city or town
 
02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
when i travel out of the area to other
 
02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:28.309 align:start position:0%
when i travel out of the area to other
states

states
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
and mention that i'm from new hampshire
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes i hear people say
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
oh i've heard of new hampshire that's a
 
02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
place you can show up vote
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
well under this proposed legislation
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
same-day registrants that come to the
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
polls without a valid photo id will be
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
quiet to vote by affidavit ballot
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 418 as amended would require
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
for all elections if a vote on election
 
02:39:56.309 --> 02:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
day is registering to vote for the first
 
02:39:56.319 --> 02:39:57.270 align:start position:0%

02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
does not have a valid photo
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
identification establishing such voters
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
identity or does not meet the identity
 
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
requirement of rsa 659 colon 13
 
02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
then such voter shall vote by affidavit
 
02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:10.790 align:start position:0%
then such voter shall vote by affidavit
valid

02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
valid
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
this new provision
 
02:40:14.309 --> 02:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
requires the affidavit of said voter to
 
02:40:16.469 --> 02:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
be returned with missing voter
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
qualification documents within seven
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
days to the secretary of state either in
 
02:40:23.190 --> 02:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
person or by mail
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
if the voter fails to comply and does
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
not prove their identity within the
 
02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
seven day window then the secretary of
 
02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
state will instruct the moderator of the
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
affected town or district to count
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
any of these unqualified ballots using
 
02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
the same method used for hand counting
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
ballots on election day the votes cast
 
02:40:42.309 --> 02:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
on such unqualified
 
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballots shall be deducted from
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
the total
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
for each affected candidate this
 
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislation contrary to some rumors
 
02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
circulating out there will not affect
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
any ukava ballots or military cast
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
ballots in any way
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
as a united states coast guard veteran i
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
would never support any legislation that
 
02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
would restrict voting of our military
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
and in fact without them we may not even
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
have the right to vote
 
02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
the majority finds us to be a fair and
 
02:41:11.269 --> 02:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable solution to voter integrity
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
issues and the best way to restore voter
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
confidence to our citizens
 
02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
confidence in the election process is at
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
an all-time low which which does hurt
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
and somewhat suppresses the turnout
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
the stronger voter confidence the more
 
02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:27.349 align:start position:0%
the stronger voter confidence the more
likely

02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
likely
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
you are to come out and vote which in
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
turn increases voter turnout as the
 
02:41:32.950 --> 02:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
confidence is regained
 
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
please press the green button and vote
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
yes for restoring voter confidence
 
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire residents closing the
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
no id loophole
 
02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:47.200 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker

sb 418
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
is an expensive and complicated solution
 
02:42:07.990 --> 02:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
to a problem
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire secretary of state
 
02:42:17.269 --> 02:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
says that elections in new hampshire
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
are free
 
02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:20.630 align:start position:0%
are free

trustworthy
 
02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
that they're not marred by fraud
 
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
and that they have all the integrity
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we could ever hope elections to
 
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.710 align:start position:0%

02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
our elections are secure
 
02:42:41.439 --> 02:42:43.190 align:start position:0%
our elections are secure
accurate

02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
02:42:45.269 --> 02:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
and reliable
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
there is governor sununu said
 
02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
is to follow the example of governor
 
02:42:57.520 --> 02:42:59.030 align:start position:0%
is to follow the example of governor
sununu

02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
sununu
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
and our secretary of state
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
and tell
 
02:43:02.479 --> 02:43:03.510 align:start position:0%
and tell
voters

02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
voters
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
instead of this
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
this bill from the other body indulges
 
02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:12.870 align:start position:0%
this bill from the other body indulges
misinformation

02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
02:43:17.110 --> 02:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
political scientists
 
02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
have shown that the problem with
 
02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:22.389 align:start position:0%
have shown that the problem with
elections

02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
in the united states is not that
 
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
citizens vote
 
02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
more than once
 
02:43:30.309 --> 02:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
but that many citizens
 
02:43:32.309 --> 02:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
encounter too many obstacles to
 
02:43:35.910 --> 02:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
exercising their right to vote at all
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
the problem empirically
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
is not fraudulent turnout
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
but low turnout
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why legislators
 
02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the republican party
 
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
and in the democratic party
 
02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
for 35 years
 
02:43:56.790 --> 02:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
following the voting rights act of 1965
 
02:43:59.190 --> 02:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
tried to address low turnout by removing
 
02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:00.389 align:start position:0%
tried to address low turnout by removing
impediments

02:44:00.389 --> 02:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
impediments
 
02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
to accessing the ballot it was only
 
02:44:05.269 --> 02:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
after the almost tied election of 2000
 
02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
that some cynical strategists came to
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
the belief that the best way to win
 
02:44:11.590 --> 02:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
elections was not by persuading voters
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
but by discouraging voters
 
02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
and this has led us away from the
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
turnout question to endlessly chasing
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
the ghost of election fraud
 
02:44:26.469 --> 02:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
does not solve
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
any existing problems but it does
 
02:44:34.230 --> 02:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
create some real new it would create
 
02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
real new problems here's just one
 
02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
it creates two classes of voters
 
02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
when somebody if this bill were to pass
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
more than 30 days prior to an election
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
they prove their citizenship
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
by signing
 
02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
the voter registration form
 
02:45:00.389 --> 02:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
which contains an affidavit in which
 
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
they attest to being citizens of the
 
02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
united states that's how they prove
 
02:45:05.349 --> 02:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
their citizenship
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
but somebody who registers to vote on
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
voting day
 
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
for this bill to pass would have to
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
offer a passport
 
02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:15.590 align:start position:0%
offer a passport
or

02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
a birth certificate
 
02:45:19.590 --> 02:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
to prove their citizenship
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
so we're creating two classes of voters
 
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
one that proved their citizenship by
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
signing an affidavit and another they
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
have to prove it by producing a passport
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
that costs more than a hundred dollars
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
to procure that many citizens don't
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
possess or by producing a birth
 
02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.830 align:start position:0%
possess or by producing a birth
certificate

02:45:35.830 --> 02:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
that many many people don't have ready
 
02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
access to many people don't have ready
 
02:45:41.590 --> 02:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
access to their original embossed and
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
stamped birth certificate and many
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
do not carry it with them
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
when they go to vote
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
so we have two classes of voters with
 
02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
different burdens
 
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
for proving their citizenship that is
 
02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:55.750 align:start position:0%
for proving their citizenship that is
wrong

02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:45:57.510 --> 02:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it will i think
 
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
i predict be declared unconstitutional
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
citizens should have the same
 
02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
requirements to prove their eligibility
 
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility to vote
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
no matter when they register to vote
 
02:46:12.469 --> 02:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
sb 418 violates that
 
02:46:14.870 --> 02:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
for this reason as well as the broad
 
02:46:18.309 --> 02:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
effect of sb 418 on ballot access
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
i urge this body
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.230 --> 02:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
we're on to the final speaker a division
 
02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
has been requested
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
members will take their seats chair
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative berry
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr speaker i'll be brief
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
so i always like to start off the
 
02:46:51.910 --> 02:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
election law
 
02:46:54.309 --> 02:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
speeches with reminding the body just
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
what is required to vote in the state of
 
02:46:57.910 --> 02:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:46:59.110 --> 02:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's nothing
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's nothing you have to produce nothing
 
02:47:03.030 --> 02:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
you sign an affidavit it's a piece of
 
02:47:05.990 --> 02:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
paper it means nothing
 
02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
opponents of this say the affidavit has
 
02:47:09.910 --> 02:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
merit five thousand dollar penalty you
 
02:47:11.269 --> 02:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
can go to jail
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
real that's awesome
 
02:47:14.309 --> 02:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
track that person down when they've
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
given you a fake name and a fake address
 
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
and to take them to jail
 
02:47:21.750 --> 02:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's a laughable system
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
what we did mr speaker with the
 
02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that this body passed is we
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
scoped this bill down to address people
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
that are showing up to the polling
 
02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
location on election day who are not
 
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
registered to vote
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
and are registering to vote with nothing
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
they are presenting nothing to show who
 
02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
they are who they say they are
 
02:47:44.389 --> 02:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
02:47:46.469 --> 02:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
i have never claimed that there's
 
02:47:48.150 --> 02:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
massive voter fraud in the state of new
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire i've never made that claim
 
02:47:52.790 --> 02:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
i have said from the beginning in fact
 
02:47:54.150 --> 02:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
the first speech i ever gave to this
 
02:47:55.990 --> 02:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
body was that new hampshire has a
 
02:47:57.990 --> 02:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
serious problem with lack of faith in
 
02:48:00.790 --> 02:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
the elections i cited a
 
02:48:02.790 --> 02:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
saint anselm's poll at the time that
 
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
showed that only 63 percent of granite
 
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
staters were extremely confident in the
 
02:48:08.469 --> 02:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
outcome of an election
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
so while we while the minority party
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
speaks of turnout
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
let me be very clear
 
02:48:16.230 --> 02:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire republicans are not afraid
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
of high voter turnout we just won an
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
election with the highest turnout ever
 
02:48:23.110 --> 02:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
we're not afraid of it what we want to
 
02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:23.910 align:start position:0%
we're not afraid of it what we want to
know

02:48:23.910 --> 02:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
is that people who are going to the
 
02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:26.469 align:start position:0%
is that people who are going to the
polls

02:48:26.469 --> 02:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
polls
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
are who they say they are
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
this is a compromise
 
02:48:32.710 --> 02:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
off of the original bill
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i'll end with this
 
02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
if we have concerns about turnout
 
02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
those turnouts in my opinion
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
are low because of a lack of a faith in
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
the elections because we have a process
 
02:48:46.309 --> 02:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
that while we can have a debate to the
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
extent it's being abused because there's
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
no debate that it's being abused because
 
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
we've prosecuted it
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
but mr speaker people who have don't
 
02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
have faith in the elections don't vote
 
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
if you want to increase voter turnout
 
02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
which republicans do
 
02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
give the people a system that they can
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
have faith in and that's what this does
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the questions
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
remember it does not yield
 
02:49:17.590 --> 02:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
roll call has been requested is that
 
02:49:28.469 --> 02:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded members will
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
take their seats this is a roll call
 
02:49:32.880 --> 02:50:39.349 align:start position:0%
take their seats this is a roll call
vote

02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:43.830 --> 02:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
the majority report of auto passes
 
02:50:50.230 --> 02:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
amended on senate bill 418.
 
02:50:53.590 --> 02:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
02:50:55.750 --> 02:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative lane for
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that this
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
bill attempts to discourage voting by
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
establishing provisional balloting which
 
02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
identifies a voter's ballot
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
sets it aside to be counted only if
 
02:51:15.359 --> 02:51:17.030 align:start position:0%
sets it aside to be counted only if
needed

02:51:17.030 --> 02:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:51:19.750 --> 02:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
and if a complicated process is followed
 
02:51:21.110 --> 02:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
by the voter
 
02:51:24.309 --> 02:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
and that it will delay a final tally for
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
seven to ten days if utilized
 
02:51:29.429 --> 02:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
there are significant questions as to
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
whether the bill violates new hampshire
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
constitution part two rule i'm sorry
 
02:51:38.710 --> 02:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
article 32
 
02:51:42.550 --> 02:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
and rsa 656-16
 
02:51:45.190 --> 02:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill makes it
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
exceedingly difficult
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
for the secretary of state to comply
 
02:51:53.590 --> 02:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
with the uniformed and overseas citizens
 
02:51:55.590 --> 02:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
absentee voting act
 
02:51:58.150 --> 02:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
thereby endangering the ability of our
 
02:52:00.309 --> 02:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
service members and their families to
 
02:52:00.319 --> 02:52:01.190 align:start position:0%
service members and their families to
vote

02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:52:03.429 --> 02:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
then i would press the red button to
 
02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
defeat this motion so that another
 
02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
motion may be brought forward thank you
 
02:52:09.750 --> 02:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
chair i recognize remember barbara
 
02:52:13.190 --> 02:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
griffin for parliamentary inquiry
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:52:17.429 --> 02:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill as amended
 
02:52:20.389 --> 02:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
continues to allow all persons who come
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
to a polling place on election day to
 
02:52:25.349 --> 02:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
cast a ballot
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
and if mr speaker if i know that this
 
02:52:30.630 --> 02:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
bill does not address citizenship but
 
02:52:33.070 --> 02:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue of positive
 
02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
identification a requirement in voting
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
which has been upheld as legal across
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
the country
 
02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
and if i know that it provides for
 
02:52:45.750 --> 02:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
meaningful verification of that id
 
02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
within seven days of the election and
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
that in 2020 there were 733 persons who
 
02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
voted in this state with no
 
02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
identification and that follow-up action
 
02:53:00.429 --> 02:53:00.439 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state resulted in
 
02:53:04.469 --> 02:53:04.479 align:start position:0%
260 of those being unable to be verified
 
02:53:06.870 --> 02:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
or located in the state
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker if i know that
 
02:53:11.590 --> 02:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
this would have no adverse effect on
 
02:53:14.309 --> 02:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
yukaba voters as the time period
 
02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
originally proposed in this bill has
 
02:53:18.870 --> 02:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
been decreased to seven days and the
 
02:53:20.389 --> 02:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office has
 
02:53:22.630 --> 02:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
indicated that it's adequate time to
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
deal with the issuance of those ballots
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
would i now press the green button to
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
support the recommendation of the
 
02:53:32.309 --> 02:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
committee thank you mr speaker

thank you mr speaker
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that this bill adds
 
02:57:32.790 --> 02:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances as a basis under which
 
02:57:34.950 --> 02:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
someone can vote absentee
 
02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
which are vague undefined and open-ended
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the greater
 
02:57:43.349 --> 02:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
the volume of absentee ballots the
 
02:57:45.269 --> 02:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
greater the risk there is of error and

inaccuracy in the final vote count
 
02:57:49.750 --> 02:57:49.760 align:start position:0%

and mr speaker
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill exceeds the
 
02:57:57.990 --> 02:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional allowance for absentee
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
voting and the current reasons to allow
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
for absentee voting are sufficient
 
02:58:05.110 --> 02:58:05.120 align:start position:0%

mr speaker
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
this pill represents the economic
 
04:09:48.149 --> 04:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
ignorance in our society today
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
economists from different schools of
 
04:09:51.269 --> 04:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
thought debate constantly on a lot of
 
04:09:51.279 --> 04:09:52.229 align:start position:0%
thought debate constantly on a lot of
topics

04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
topics
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
however they don't debate on
 
04:09:55.349 --> 04:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
protectionism they agree that
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
protectionism is harmful and that its
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
costs outweigh the benefits and that it
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
impedes economic growth
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
this protectionist bill will force
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to subsidize local businesses
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
it will increase the cost of government
 
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
one rationale for protectionism is to
 
04:10:15.030 --> 04:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
level the playing field this idea
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
suggests that because other countries
 
04:10:18.870 --> 04:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
subsidize their industry we must do
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
something to make it equal
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
this pinpoints one tiny tiny area of
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
unfairness and ignores that the world is
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
infinitely complex there are so many
 
04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
inputs into the production of a good
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
like steel
 
04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
we would need to check if any of the
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
inputs for us steel
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
have any other fair advantages in the
 
04:10:40.389 --> 04:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
trucking or the trade schools for the
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
laborers or environmental compliance
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
rules or safety compliance or countless
 
04:10:47.189 --> 04:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
other areas
 
04:10:48.550 --> 04:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
there's always advantages and
 
04:10:50.630 --> 04:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
disadvantages to do one thing in one
 
04:10:53.110 --> 04:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
place or another where does it end if
 
04:10:54.870 --> 04:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
somebody tried to grow bananas in new
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire should we also sub-size them
 
04:10:59.189 --> 04:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
due to the unfairness
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
with regions that have climates more
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
suitable for this
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
we should allow the market to find areas
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
of strength in our side this is known as
 
04:11:09.870 --> 04:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
comparative advantage
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
investopedia.com defines comparative
 
04:11:14.229 --> 04:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
advantage as an economy's ability to
 
04:11:16.870 --> 04:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
produce a particular good or service
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
at a lower opportunity cost
 
04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
than its trading partners
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
comparative advantage is used to explain
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
why companies countries or individuals
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
can benefit from trade
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
additionally other countries economic
 
04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
interventions does not actually give
 
04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
them an advantage
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the case of candidates applies power
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
and health care to its industry
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's not cheaper for canada to levy
 
04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
attacks on its citizens to cover
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
electrical power than for a private
 
04:11:45.510 --> 04:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
company to directly pay for the power
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
these costs don't magically go away
 
04:11:49.590 --> 04:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
because the government is covering them
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
however if it is that canada or anyone
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
else is subsidizing their exports or
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise under pricing their goods we
 
04:11:57.510 --> 04:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
should actually be happy to take
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
advantage of the situation
 
04:12:01.510 --> 04:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
we should allow canada to subsidize our
 
04:12:03.670 --> 04:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
public work projects and thank them for
 
04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
the favor
 
04:12:08.229 --> 04:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
another concern is we need to stop the
 
04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
money from floating out of the united
 
04:12:09.760 --> 04:12:11.030 align:start position:0%
money from floating out of the united
states

04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
this type of thinking is a confusion
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
between money and wealth it's important
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
to understand that money is a unit of
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
account and not wealth
 
04:12:19.269 --> 04:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
all things being equal the amount of
 
04:12:21.510 --> 04:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
money flowing around the united states
 
04:12:23.830 --> 04:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the economy per se
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
it would only affect the price of things
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
nominally besides the united states is
 
04:12:31.110 --> 04:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
experiencing 8.5 inflation so it might
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
be good to export some more cash in that
 
04:12:33.439 --> 04:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
be good to export some more cash in that
regard

04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
the principle of the scene and the
 
04:12:37.359 --> 04:12:38.710 align:start position:0%
the principle of the scene and the
unseen

04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
unseen
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
government policy only focuses on the
 
04:12:43.510 --> 04:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
scene while ignoring the unseen
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
in this case we want to protect the jobs
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
of steel workers
 
04:12:48.790 --> 04:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's true this legislation will benefit
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
that special interest and they will
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
maintain workers this is the scene
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
one unseen consequence of this is the
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
now higher labor costs will cause other
 
04:12:59.110 --> 04:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
businesses to fail however no one will
 
04:13:01.110 --> 04:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
able to connect the dots and prove that
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
this struggle is impart affected by this
 
04:13:03.279 --> 04:13:05.110 align:start position:0%
this struggle is impart affected by this
legislation

04:13:05.110 --> 04:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:13:06.870 --> 04:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing causes countless
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
unseen ripples throughout the economy
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
the labor market today is weak anyways
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
since protections
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
since protectionism has been known by
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
academics for centuries to be
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
destructive then why does it
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
continuously become law
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's for the same reason that only
 
04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
people who are for the bill showed up to
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
test the testimony
 
04:13:34.710 --> 04:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
the principle of concentrated benefits
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
and diffuse costs
 
04:13:38.070 --> 04:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
provides that the individual costs to
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
each taxpayer is so low that it's not
 
04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
worth the effort to fight the new law
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
but the benefit is so high for the steel
 
04:13:45.990 --> 04:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
producers that it is worth the effort to
 
04:13:47.830 --> 04:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
fight for the law
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
imagine a bill that transfers one
 
04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars to a single individual
 
04:13:52.710 --> 04:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
per year
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
he has a good incentive to fight for
 
04:13:54.239 --> 04:13:55.189 align:start position:0%
he has a good incentive to fight for
this

04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
and let's say it will cost 100 million
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
people one penny per year
 
04:14:00.870 --> 04:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
these people have no incentive to fight
 
04:14:02.309 --> 04:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
against the law
 
04:14:05.429 --> 04:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
this principle applies here
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
protectionist policies don't protect the
 
04:14:09.429 --> 04:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
industry it intends to and hurts our
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
national defense
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
the jones act that requires u.s flag

thank you mr speaker does the member
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
yield the questions
 
04:15:30.560 --> 04:15:31.910 align:start position:0%
yield the questions
yes

04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you
 
04:15:38.950 --> 04:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't ask if you would agree that
 
04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
if we pass protective protectionist
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislation like this it only encourages
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
the protected industry to be less
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
competitive to stop seeking out new and
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
innovative ways to make their product
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
better and cheaper because they don't
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes that's exactly correct without uh
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
without international pressure to force
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
um companies to innovate and to to
 
04:16:08.469 --> 04:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
produce goods at you know better quality
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
and lower cost um
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
you know they're gonna it's gonna be a
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
worse product i like to think about
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
brazil in the 1980s they
 
04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
had massive protectionist rules against
 
04:16:21.030 --> 04:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
the electronics computers and software
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
and because of this a brazilian fax
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
machine cost five to ten thousand
 
04:16:24.960 --> 04:16:26.149 align:start position:0%
machine cost five to ten thousand
dollars

04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
and uh the protocol was proprietary to
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
brazil so no other factory in the world
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
was even compatible with it um so these
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
kind of protect and now they don't have
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
any industry really in the
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
microprocessor space because they
 
04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
destroyed it with their protectionism
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
remember yield to a further question
 
04:16:47.670 --> 04:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you
 
04:16:52.630 --> 04:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative for taking uh my question
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the
 
04:16:55.439 --> 04:16:56.630 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the
implication

04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
implication
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
of tariffs and other
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
protective strategies for u.s industries
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
actually hurt u.s industries
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
a case in point i work for a
 
04:17:09.910 --> 04:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing company in manchester we
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
import steel and aluminum from um
 
04:17:14.710 --> 04:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
primarily from from europe it's
 
04:17:16.950 --> 04:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
specialty material and that when the
 
04:17:19.269 --> 04:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
when the tariffs were passed to protect
 
04:17:22.229 --> 04:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
u.s steel and aluminum it caused your
 
04:17:24.630 --> 04:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative you were you know for a
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
question that the domestic supply simply
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
increases prices to match those and
 
04:17:31.110 --> 04:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
really the only outcome is the end
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
consumer has to spend more money to get
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
what they need
 
04:17:40.950 --> 04:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:42.630 --> 04:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes that's correct the domestic
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
product would be priced to uh consume
 
04:17:45.359 --> 04:17:46.389 align:start position:0%
product would be priced to uh consume
the

04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:48.149 --> 04:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
the price of the empire product plus
 
04:17:48.159 --> 04:17:51.349 align:start position:0%
the price of the empire product plus
tariff

04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
colleagues i um
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
i didn't have anything else to wear
 
04:18:04.800 --> 04:18:08.550 align:start position:0%
i didn't have anything else to wear
today

04:18:08.550 --> 04:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
so this bill states that
 
04:18:13.110 --> 04:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
for projects over one million dollars
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
the state will use american-made steel
 
04:18:19.030 --> 04:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
with few exceptions
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
when budweiser came to merrimack or or
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
when walmart came to raymond
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
those specific corporations received tax
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
incentives to come to new hampshire
 
04:18:32.149 --> 04:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is not a subsidy to any
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
specific corporation
 
04:18:37.269 --> 04:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
all steel fabricators will continue to
 
04:18:39.030 --> 04:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
have to bid
 
04:18:41.590 --> 04:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
for these projects
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state has the right
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
to go with foreign steel
 
04:18:48.070 --> 04:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
if it is in the best interest of the
 
04:18:51.110 --> 04:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
state that is in the bill
 
04:18:54.630 --> 04:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
23 states already have america first
 
04:18:54.640 --> 04:18:56.710 align:start position:0%
23 states already have america first
programs

04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
of one type or another including alabama
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
indiana oklahoma and texas
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
currently there is a federal tariff on
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
steel but the chinese figured out a way
 
04:19:11.110 --> 04:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
around the tariff
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
they simply drill a small hole in the
 
04:19:13.680 --> 04:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
they simply drill a small hole in the
metal

04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
metal
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
now it is considered processed steel
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
they drill a hole
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's a literal loophole in the tariff
 
04:19:24.080 --> 04:19:26.309 align:start position:0%
it's a literal loophole in the tariff
law

04:19:26.309 --> 04:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
this makes it difficult for new
 
04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire steel fabricators to compete
 
04:19:32.149 --> 04:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
on a level playing field

this commission
 
04:19:41.429 --> 04:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
and find that it does not place an undue
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
burden on the state at all
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
will help level the playing field i ask
 
04:19:50.229 --> 04:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
for your support for this bipartisan
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
bill to end the unfair advantage on
 
04:19:57.110 --> 04:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
foreign steel thank you mr speaker
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
i rise in opposition to this bill and
 
04:20:12.790 --> 04:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
the reasons i'll give are are principled
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
and practical i'll start out with the
 
04:20:14.720 --> 04:20:15.670 align:start position:0%
and practical i'll start out with the
principal

04:20:15.670 --> 04:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
principal
 
04:20:15.680 --> 04:20:16.870 align:start position:0%
principal
uh

04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:19.110 --> 04:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
reasons and that is that
 
04:20:21.590 --> 04:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
as has been stated protectionism
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
does not work in the long run
 
04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
in this if this bill is is
 
04:20:26.800 --> 04:20:27.830 align:start position:0%
in this if this bill is is
passed

04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
it will affect a very small very small
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
segment of the u.s manufacturing
 
04:20:34.800 --> 04:20:35.910 align:start position:0%
segment of the u.s manufacturing
segment

04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
segment
 
04:20:35.920 --> 04:20:37.189 align:start position:0%
segment
and

04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
that manufacturing segment does not have
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
the capacity does not have the capacity
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
to produce enough steel for our needs in
 
04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
04:20:49.910 --> 04:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
could it come to that point over a long
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
period of time yes but not in the short
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
term it also impacts a very very small
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
segment of our new hampshire businesses
 
04:21:00.710 --> 04:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
four maybe five
 
04:21:04.870 --> 04:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
significant fabricators of steel
 
04:21:06.149 --> 04:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
in my
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
business outside of this
 
04:21:08.399 --> 04:21:10.630 align:start position:0%
business outside of this
legislature

04:21:10.630 --> 04:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
i'm a general contractor and i'll give
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
you an example of a project that we have
 
04:21:15.199 --> 04:21:16.950 align:start position:0%
you an example of a project that we have
going

04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
in rochester right now
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
this project will use somewhere between
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
two point five and three million dollars
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
structural steel
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
it is not a municipal product
 
04:21:30.790 --> 04:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
project excuse me so
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
it would not be impacted by this bill
 
04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
using the project as an illustration if
 
04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
this were a municipal project and it
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
could very easily be it's it's
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
comparable to others
 
04:21:45.110 --> 04:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
this project would be delayed
 
04:21:47.510 --> 04:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
by a minimum of a year
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
if this bill applied
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
the bar joists that will be used in that
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
building which are part of the
 
04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
structural steel are primarily produced
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
in canada
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers here in new hampshire
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the capability of producing
 
04:22:05.110 --> 04:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
that currently the backlog on bar joists
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
is eight months to a year if we made
 
04:22:09.910 --> 04:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
this american steel it would be two to
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
three years
 
04:22:13.349 --> 04:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
we would simply not be able to produce
 
04:22:15.110 --> 04:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
it i could go
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
to other aspects of the structural steel
 
04:22:19.110 --> 04:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
in that building
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
how would this affect
 
04:22:20.720 --> 04:22:21.510 align:start position:0%
how would this affect
our

04:22:21.510 --> 04:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
businesses within new hampshire
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
if we said that
 
04:22:29.110 --> 04:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
the product had to be purchased using
 
04:22:31.590 --> 04:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
american steel on the one hand
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
yes it would prevent
 
04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
the import of canadian or
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
or chinese steel or western european
 
04:22:40.319 --> 04:22:41.429 align:start position:0%
or chinese steel or western european
steel

04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
steel
 
04:22:41.439 --> 04:22:42.790 align:start position:0%
steel
but

04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:22:44.550 --> 04:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
what it would also do
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
is it dries up the source of steel for
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
these manufacturers for these
 
04:22:48.479 --> 04:22:49.910 align:start position:0%
these manufacturers for these
fabricators

04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
fabricators
 
04:22:52.469 --> 04:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
and we use these fabricators we try to
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
use them every instance we can or new
 
04:22:56.229 --> 04:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire fabricators
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
but they would not be able to purchase
 
04:23:01.110 --> 04:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
the steel this bill says that the steel
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be produced in the u.s from
 
04:23:06.149 --> 04:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
melting from melting
 
04:23:07.990 --> 04:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
through finished product including the
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
coatings including all the components of
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
it everything
 
04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
if the steel has to be produced from
 
04:23:17.910 --> 04:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
iron ore in the united states and our
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
plants our steel plants do not have the
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
capacity and they do not have the
 
04:23:25.990 --> 04:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
capacity it will delay municipal product
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
projects and if the answer is well we'll
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
just give them a waiver why are we
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
putting in a bill that we're going to
 
04:23:33.030 --> 04:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
give everybody waivers for because
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise the project will be delayed a
 
04:23:34.640 --> 04:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
otherwise the project will be delayed a
year

04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't quite make sense
 
04:23:39.910 --> 04:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:23:42.469 --> 04:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
other side of it as far as again just
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
the principled application
 
04:23:47.429 --> 04:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
if this is to apply to structural steel
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
that is again a very tiny component of
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
the steel industry of steel usage in the
 
04:23:52.560 --> 04:23:53.510 align:start position:0%
the steel industry of steel usage in the
u.s

04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
u.s
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
if this applies just to structural steel
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
why not protect
 
04:24:01.830 --> 04:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
steel in dishwashers microwaves bed
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
frames nails bolts
 
04:24:08.469 --> 04:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
etc etc door springs
 
04:24:11.429 --> 04:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we say in a in a new
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire building a new hampshire
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
municipal building that it has to cover
 
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
all those items and then
 
04:24:19.110 --> 04:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
if we say that it's fair to protect them
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
why would we not perfect protect our
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
lumber mills in the u.s and say nope all
 
04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
the lumber in the building has to be
 
04:24:27.269 --> 04:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
that and i'll tell you why we wouldn't
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
do it because it would be a disaster for
 
04:24:29.760 --> 04:24:30.469 align:start position:0%
do it because it would be a disaster for
us

04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
because we do not have the capacity to
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
produce that
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
you might think i'm up here
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
arguing against our manufacturing i am
 
04:24:40.950 --> 04:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
totally in support of united states
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturing i think we should do
 
04:24:45.429 --> 04:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
everything in our power to increase that
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
but the best way to increase that is to
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
encourage competitiveness
 
04:24:51.750 --> 04:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
and part of that is by reducing
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
unreasonable regulations that literally
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
plague our industries
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
if passed
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
will not do what it's intended to do
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
it will in fact i believe harm the very
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
industry that it's intended to protect
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
i would urge you
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
04:25:13.439 --> 04:25:14.229 align:start position:0%
to vote
red

04:25:14.229 --> 04:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
red
 
04:25:15.910 --> 04:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
on this committee amendment so an
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
alternate alternate
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:23.590 --> 04:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
grote for
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:31.750 --> 04:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is the last speaker
 
04:25:34.149 --> 04:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker we'll get to the
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
roll call in a minute
 
04:25:43.269 --> 04:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 438
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
is not as complicated
 
04:25:48.389 --> 04:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
as one will lead to believe listening to
 
04:25:50.469 --> 04:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
our previous speakers
 
04:25:54.149 --> 04:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 438 requires the state
 
04:25:56.229 --> 04:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
to use american
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
in in-state agency projects
 
04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
for those projects that exceed a million
 
04:26:06.000 --> 04:26:07.670 align:start position:0%
for those projects that exceed a million
dollars

04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
so that would be for road construction
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
for road projects bridges
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
can you not hear me
 
04:26:14.239 --> 04:26:16.950 align:start position:0%
can you not hear me
okay

04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
at least four steel fabricators in
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
america in new hampshire
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
that could use this
 
04:26:26.800 --> 04:26:28.389 align:start position:0%
that could use this
legislation

04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:26:30.870 --> 04:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
to quote on jobs
 
04:26:33.429 --> 04:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
these are small private
 
04:26:33.439 --> 04:26:35.189 align:start position:0%
these are small private
companies

04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
companies
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
and as i've stood here
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
to listen to all of us for the last four
 
04:26:40.800 --> 04:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
to listen to all of us for the last four
years

you mr speaker
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know i like steele
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i really like u.s steel
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
but mr speaker i also like free market
 
04:29:56.399 --> 04:29:58.149 align:start position:0%
but mr speaker i also like free market
principles

04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
principles
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
under senate bill
 
04:29:59.680 --> 04:30:01.030 align:start position:0%
under senate bill

04:30:01.030 --> 04:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
438
 
04:30:03.030 --> 04:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
there would be a special interest carve
 
04:30:03.040 --> 04:30:03.750 align:start position:0%
there would be a special interest carve
out

04:30:03.750 --> 04:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:30:07.030 --> 04:30:07.040 align:start position:0%

04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
a million dollars or more
 
04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
but not for projects costing 999
 
04:30:13.439 --> 04:30:14.389 align:start position:0%
but not for projects costing 999
thousand

04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
04:30:17.110 --> 04:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
this this is a pi representative correct
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
go figure
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
this is a subsidy for local businesses
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
which will force taxpayers to pay more
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i buy local whenever i can
 
04:30:32.070 --> 04:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
should force our citizens to pay more
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
for construction based on the cost of a
 
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
particular building
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
hence driving up the cost and creating a
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
supply shortage
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
and finally mr speaker this bill places
 
04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
u.s manufacturers in a special class
 
04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
contrary to the constitution part 1
 
04:30:50.469 --> 04:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
article 10. again this is a
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry right therefore
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%

04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%

mr speaker
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
if i know foreign subsidized steel has
 
04:31:23.590 --> 04:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
been stealing american jobs for decades
 
04:31:25.590 --> 04:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
and if i have seen the devastating
 
04:31:27.670 --> 04:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
effects on communities when these
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
well-paying blue-collar jobs are lost
 
04:31:29.840 --> 04:31:31.429 align:start position:0%

good jobs in new hampshire
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
this bill will give thirty dollars to
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
approximately ten thousand wic
 
04:34:37.349 --> 04:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
recipients to use at farmers markets at
 
04:34:39.269 --> 04:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
a cost of thirty thousand dollars and a
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
quarter of a full-time employee
 
04:34:43.189 --> 04:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would let disadvantaged
 
04:34:45.510 --> 04:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
families spend six five dollar coupons
 
04:34:47.109 --> 04:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
at farmers markets
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
exposing them to the offerings of a
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
great environment which is unfortunately
 
04:34:53.670 --> 04:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
the most expensive way to buy local
 
04:34:53.680 --> 04:34:54.789 align:start position:0%
the most expensive way to buy local
produce

04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
produce
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
and then leaving them unable to build a
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
habit of buying local produce at the
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
farmers market they'll still be able to
 
04:35:02.390 --> 04:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
buy produce and even new hampshire
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
produce at the grocery store with their
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
existing benefits
 
04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
this is a federal solution
 
04:35:10.869 --> 04:35:10.879 align:start position:0%
and i know that new hampshire can craft
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
a better solution
 
04:35:14.629 --> 04:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee wants to make
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
sure that new hampshire produce makes
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
its way to new hampshire plates
 
04:35:22.949 --> 04:35:22.959 align:start position:0%
especially for our neediest families
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
i think we can solve some of these
 
04:35:24.639 --> 04:35:25.750 align:start position:0%
i think we can solve some of these
problems

04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:35:28.470 --> 04:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
food waste especially imperfect produce
 
04:35:31.029 --> 04:35:31.039 align:start position:0%
reduces the available supply
 
04:35:32.551 --> 04:35:32.561 align:start position:0%
if you had a chance to get some of that
 
04:35:36.310 --> 04:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
produce would you buy it i know i would
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
csas are community supported agriculture
 
04:35:41.590 --> 04:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
they provide consistency and schedule
 
04:35:43.269 --> 04:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the growing season and they
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
expose people to the cycle of crops here
 
04:35:48.310 --> 04:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:35:50.310 --> 04:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
can we offer a tax credit to offer this
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
to our wic families or other low-income
 
04:35:52.160 --> 04:35:53.189 align:start position:0%
to our wic families or other low-income
families

04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
can we make it so those families visit
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
this farm
 
04:35:58.629 --> 04:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
and see where the food they get to eat
 
04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
has grown
 
04:36:02.629 --> 04:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
can we do this better in new hampshire
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
i think we can
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
i think new hampshire can lead the way
 
04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
for this country in ways to find
 
04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
innovative solutions to deliver our
 
04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
produce to our people that's why i ask
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
you to oppose the the otp motion so that
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made and we can
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
seize on the opportunity to discuss this
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
during the growing season and find a new
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire solution
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
as the member yield the questions
 
04:36:43.590 --> 04:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
i i thank the gentlelady for the taking
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
the question um you
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
said that you made a
 
04:36:52.230 --> 04:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
actual claim that actually surprised me
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
um since i'm a reg i'm a pretty cheap
 
04:36:55.910 --> 04:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
guy and i'm also a regular
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
um attendee of my local farmers market
 
04:37:00.789 --> 04:37:00.799 align:start position:0%
um is that in fact the most expensive
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
way to buy local produce because it
 
04:37:04.230 --> 04:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
seems to me
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
i always seems to me the uh
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
excuse me you're buying directly from
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
the growers so at least that should make
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
it cheaper so so
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question when the
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
farmers need to bring the produce to the
 
04:37:26.310 --> 04:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
farmers market
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
take time away from the farm in order to
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
bring it to a location with a chance for
 
04:37:30.480 --> 04:37:32.310 align:start position:0%
bring it to a location with a chance for
waste

04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
waste
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
with a chance for waste for the unsold
 
04:37:34.719 --> 04:37:37.109 align:start position:0%
with a chance for waste for the unsold
product

04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
product
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is more expensive than them working
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
with a csa or another thing where they
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
another opportunity where they could
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
deliver it to low-income communities in
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
order for that to be directly
 
04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
distributed to these families
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
we have a chance to let these families
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
see the cycle of local agriculture to
 
04:37:57.750 --> 04:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
get this food delivered to their
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
communities and find a way to support
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
this within our state
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
i think we can do better than just
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
starting a small program that builds up
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
a large bureaucracy to support a future
 
04:38:11.429 --> 04:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
program that we may or may not choose to
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
accept and i think new hampshire can do
 
04:38:17.590 --> 04:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:19.750 --> 04:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
chair recognizing representative acton
 
04:38:22.470 --> 04:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
speak for the committee report
 
04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
mr speaker sb 403 is a bill that
 
04:38:31.349 --> 04:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
reestablishes the wic farmers market
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
nutrition program
 
04:38:35.830 --> 04:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
this program is sponsored by the fda and
 
04:38:38.551 --> 04:38:38.561 align:start position:0%
aims to assist low-income women infants
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
and children up to age five by providing
 
04:38:43.510 --> 04:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
nutritious foods and information on
 
04:38:45.510 --> 04:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
healthy eating
 
04:38:48.310 --> 04:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
the bill adds a new section to rsa 132
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
which states
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
that the program shall distribute food
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
instruments in this case vouchers or
 
04:38:54.240 --> 04:38:55.189 align:start position:0%
instruments in this case vouchers or
credits

04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
credits
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
to eligible wic participants to redeem
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
for locally grown fresh fruits
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
vegetables and
 
04:39:04.390 --> 04:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
herbs at authorized
 
04:39:07.029 --> 04:39:07.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire farmers markets
 
04:39:08.949 --> 04:39:08.959 align:start position:0%
there are two goals that in my mind
 
04:39:11.349 --> 04:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
justify supporting this bill first by
 
04:39:13.269 --> 04:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
providing the ability for low-income
 
04:39:13.279 --> 04:39:14.310 align:start position:0%
providing the ability for low-income
families

04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
to buy nutritious locally grown foods
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
we can help build long-term
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
habits that support healthy lifestyles
 
04:39:24.551 --> 04:39:24.561 align:start position:0%
this can help reduce the long-term
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
health care expenses that are incurred
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
by the medicaid program
 
04:39:30.070 --> 04:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
each child in the program will receive a
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
credit of thirty dollars once a year
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
that will allow their family to attend
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
the farmers market and make purchases
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
i took part in a similar program last
 
04:39:39.760 --> 04:39:41.430 align:start position:0%
i took part in a similar program last
year

04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:39:44.470 --> 04:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
where veterans were given a 20 credit
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
and that was each weekend over the
 
04:39:49.350 --> 04:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
summer so my wife and i would go to the
 
04:39:50.550 --> 04:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
market and
 
04:39:51.990 --> 04:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh we would take advantage of the 20
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
dollar credit and we would wind up
 
04:39:55.830 --> 04:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
leaving with a you know quite a
 
04:39:58.470 --> 04:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
we use our own money and you know we
 
04:40:00.628 --> 04:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
basically it
 
04:40:02.708 --> 04:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
helped build a habit of actually going
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
to the farmers market rather than just
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
down to the store
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.390 --> 04:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
secondly this program will provide much
 
04:40:14.788 --> 04:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
needed revenue to new hampshire-based
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
farmers at a crucial time
 
04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
when we need to build local capacity in
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
response to the collapsing
 
04:40:24.868 --> 04:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
when the program was operating in the
 
04:40:26.400 --> 04:40:27.350 align:start position:0%
when the program was operating in the
past

04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
past
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
farmers taking part in the local markets
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
around the state reported they saw an
 
04:40:33.030 --> 04:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
increase in sales
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
that would have gone into purchasing
 
04:40:36.070 --> 04:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
processed foods
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
where produce trucked in from mexico or
 
04:40:40.470 --> 04:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
flown in from overseas
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion it becomes quite
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
apparent that we face a food supply
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
crisis the likes that pretty much not
 
04:40:51.910 --> 04:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
it it is our responsibility to prepare
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
for such a disaster by making sure that
 
04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
our farmers here in the state
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
can produce the food we need and our
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
citizens have the knowledge of how to
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
access these locally grown foods
 
04:41:07.670 --> 04:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
re-establishing the wic farmers market
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
program is necessary step into in making
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
sure there will we are building the
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
capacity we need to prepare for possible
 
04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
tough times ahead
 
04:41:18.150 --> 04:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:20.230 --> 04:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the questions uh
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
yes remember yields
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
thank you to the gentleman for taking my
 
04:41:28.718 --> 04:41:30.150 align:start position:0%
thank you to the gentleman for taking my
question

04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire were to create its own
 
04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
program would hampshire not have to put
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
the bill for the administration and all
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
the costs of this program rather than
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
utilizing existing federal dollars that
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
have already been raised and
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
appropriated for states having these
 
04:41:43.760 --> 04:41:48.070 align:start position:0%
appropriated for states having these
programs

04:41:48.070 --> 04:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay so the breakdown
 
04:41:51.670 --> 04:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
goes and
 
04:41:54.150 --> 04:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
according to the fiscal note
 
04:41:54.160 --> 04:41:55.830 align:start position:0%
according to the fiscal note
the

04:41:55.830 --> 04:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:41:56.948 --> 04:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:42:01.030 --> 04:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
pay will will pay defenders match 10 10
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
and the state will
 
04:42:04.708 --> 04:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
match another 20 dollars to make that
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
30. that's once a year
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
also on the um
 
04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
04:42:13.270 --> 04:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
full the requirements what they call the
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
the fet the full-time equivalent is only
 
04:42:16.080 --> 04:42:17.830 align:start position:0%
the fet the full-time equivalent is only
0.25

04:42:17.830 --> 04:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
0.25
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't isn't going to take a
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
full-time employee it's going to take
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
about 12 and a half hours
 
04:42:26.310 --> 04:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
a week out of someone's
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
time to admit administer this the
 
04:42:31.430 --> 04:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
farmers markets in new hampshire are are
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
well run well established and have been
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
actually very successful for years and
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
years and i i see that
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
by enabling wic again will help build on
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:48.550 --> 04:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
mr member yielded further questions
 
04:42:51.990 --> 04:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
remember yields inquire
 
04:42:53.670 --> 04:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr speaker thank you for
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question you spoke about a 20
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
veterans credit last year and it came
 
04:42:59.350 --> 04:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
week after week
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
and established a habit of going to the
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
farmers market
 
04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
how would that
 
04:43:08.230 --> 04:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
how would this one-time 30 dollars
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
the the veterans program was paid
 
04:43:18.000 --> 04:43:18.788 align:start position:0%
the the veterans program was paid
not

04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
through the
 
04:43:21.750 --> 04:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
federal system i believe i
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure exactly the funding system
 
04:43:25.750 --> 04:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
that was for uh but that was a very
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
generous benefit that was being provided
 
04:43:32.550 --> 04:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
probably by private donors um
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
30 bucks a year is not much
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
for family with three kids you know it's
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
starting to get a little bit better so
 
04:43:40.788 --> 04:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
in essence it's a little bit more
 
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
symbolic but it allows
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
families that normally would
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
probably not even have the time to even
 
04:43:49.830 --> 04:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
worry about a farmers market exposes
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
them to that let them know where it is
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
and how to get there and see what's
 
04:43:53.360 --> 04:43:54.550 align:start position:0%
and how to get there and see what's
available

04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
and um it's just a basically an
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
introduction into that system so it's a
 
04:43:59.910 --> 04:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
foot in the door it'll be an annual
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
program that goes on year and year so so
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
it would be better if we had more money
 
04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
to put in
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
for this uh certainly the
 
04:44:11.750 --> 04:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
food inflation is going to be a problem
 
04:44:11.760 --> 04:44:12.470 align:start position:0%
food inflation is going to be a problem
for

04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:44:12.480 --> 04:44:13.430 align:start position:0%
for
years

04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
but i think here we should take what we
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
get in to
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
prepare for shortages coming
 
04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
so member yield of further questions
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:29.830 --> 04:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you for
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm just curious on
 
04:44:35.110 --> 04:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
this the bill it talks about a local uh
 
04:44:37.030 --> 04:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
farmers markets within the state so i
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
assume it's limited to farmers markets
 
04:44:40.628 --> 04:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire how do we know the
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
produce that that market comes from if
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is grown in new hampshire
 
04:44:45.670 --> 04:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
is there anything that stops someone
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
from simply
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
a farmer going to maine saying i don't
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
have enough tomatoes this week so i'm
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to go over there and buy a bunch
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
and bring them over and sell them also
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:57.910 --> 04:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
the group that organizes farmers markets
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
um do a very good job of keeping the
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
keeping things organized they know who's
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
who's part of this
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh they're very prominent farms in our
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
communities in our towns and um
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
so it's unlikely that someone would be
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
able to come in and dupe them into
 
04:45:17.430 --> 04:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
pulling in
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
main produce or
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
stuff that they bought at market bask
 
04:45:22.070 --> 04:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
and turn around and sell it very
 
04:45:24.070 --> 04:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
unlikely that would happen because it's
 
04:45:53.590 --> 04:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
get here
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:01.510 --> 04:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
for what reason is it memorized for a
 
04:46:03.910 --> 04:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
motion mr speaker state your motion mr
 
04:46:05.190 --> 04:46:05.200 align:start position:0%

04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
it is a proper motion so the motion
 
04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested
 
04:46:52.450 --> 04:46:52.460 align:start position:0%

that we need to table this bill and
 
04:47:33.190 --> 04:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
maybe rethink it
 
04:47:33.200 --> 04:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
maybe rethink it
then

04:47:33.990 --> 04:47:34.000 align:start position:0%

okay thank you mr speaker
 
04:47:52.708 --> 04:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
if i know

that a bill
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
that provides fresh local produce
 
04:47:58.878 --> 04:47:59.830 align:start position:0%
that provides fresh local produce
to

04:47:59.830 --> 04:47:59.840 align:start position:0%

women and children
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
and if i know that a bill
 
04:48:07.910 --> 04:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
that provides
 
04:48:09.510 --> 04:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
extra support
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%

local farmers market know exactly where
 
04:48:24.390 --> 04:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
everybody else's produce comes from
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
would i now oppose the tabling motion

the recommendation that the bill ought

04:51:39.190 --> 04:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 407
 
04:51:41.590 --> 04:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
extends postpartum benefits under our
 
04:51:43.510 --> 04:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
state's medicaid program
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
from a current period of 60 days
 
04:51:48.628 --> 04:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
to an entire year
 
04:51:50.628 --> 04:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
and although i think this is a very
 
04:51:52.708 --> 04:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
laudable goal
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
it does so at the expense of adding yet
 
04:51:57.750 --> 04:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
another straw to the camel's back of
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
government spending
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment before you is intended to
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
address what i believe is the most
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
sb 407
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
takes advantage of a provision in the
 
04:52:18.390 --> 04:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
and under that under that act there are
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
federal matching funds
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
to co-fund
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
this extension of postpartum benefits
 
04:52:29.350 --> 04:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
for states that adopt it
 
04:52:31.350 --> 04:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
there is however a catch
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
and the catch is that the federal
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
funding expires after five years
 
04:52:38.788 --> 04:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
if you look closely at senate bill 407
 
04:52:40.948 --> 04:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
you will notice that there is no such
 
04:52:40.958 --> 04:52:42.788 align:start position:0%
you will notice that there is no such
expiration

04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
expiration
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment before you simply adds a
 
04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
provision that when the federal funding
 
04:52:50.390 --> 04:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
when the federal matching funds expire
 
04:52:53.670 --> 04:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
this program too will expire
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%

i'm sorry that caught me unawares
the

04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
reason this came out of our committee as
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
we had without recommendation is we had
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
a very long day
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
and when the
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill in the senate
 
04:59:44.948 --> 04:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
brought us the bill she also brought us
 
04:59:47.190 --> 04:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
several suggestions
 
04:59:50.550 --> 04:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
that she thought would clarify the bill
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
and as it was clear when she was
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
presenting them to the committee that
 
04:59:58.150 --> 04:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
they appeared to be acceptable
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
i obtained an amendment
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
that had
 
05:00:06.150 --> 05:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
those changes but we didn't vote on the
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill right away
 
05:00:11.510 --> 05:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then it was a long day
 
05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
and we never got to vote on that
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
amendment so that's why we are here
 
05:00:18.070 --> 05:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
without amendment
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
without recommendation rather but
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does is it simply
 
05:00:26.230 --> 05:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
makes some minor clarifications to the
 
05:00:26.240 --> 05:00:27.510 align:start position:0%
makes some minor clarifications to the
bill

05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:00:31.990 --> 05:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to make very
 
05:00:32.000 --> 05:00:33.270 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to make very
sure

05:00:33.270 --> 05:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:00:38.948 --> 05:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
that we only send kids out of state
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
for out-of-state placements when they
 
05:00:43.750 --> 05:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
are completely and utterly
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
necessary and there's adequate clinical
 
05:00:46.400 --> 05:00:48.310 align:start position:0%
necessary and there's adequate clinical
documentation

05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
05:00:48.320 --> 05:00:49.270 align:start position:0%
documentation
that

05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:00:50.470 --> 05:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
the only
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
way that a child receives the treatment
 
05:00:57.430 --> 05:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
that they need
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
because as we all know keeping kids here
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
is not only the right thing to do
 
05:01:04.310 --> 05:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
because it keeps them closer to their
 
05:01:06.230 --> 05:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
homes and their families
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's also a lot less expensive
 
05:01:09.600 --> 05:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
it's also a lot less expensive
so

05:01:11.270 --> 05:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
the changes
 
05:01:13.200 --> 05:01:14.070 align:start position:0%
the changes
uh

05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
were that they made it clear that these
 
05:01:20.868 --> 05:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
that a behavioral
 
05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
analysis assessment is only going to be
 
05:01:22.958 --> 05:01:23.750 align:start position:0%
analysis assessment is only going to be
done

05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:01:26.070 --> 05:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
when clinically necessary
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
the further change
 
05:01:30.550 --> 05:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
allocates the responsibility for doing
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
that behavioral assessment
 
05:01:35.670 --> 05:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
to the school if existing law already
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
requires the school to do that
 
05:01:39.270 --> 05:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
behavioral assessment
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
and to the department in cases where the
 
05:01:43.590 --> 05:01:43.600 align:start position:0%

so it really is just a clarification and
 
05:01:50.230 --> 05:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
then it changed the word individual to
 
05:01:52.150 --> 05:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
individuals so that
 
05:01:54.310 --> 05:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
assessments might be done by more than
 
05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
one person when they needed to happen so
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
i just learned a little while ago
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
because i did some more reading that
 
05:03:57.030 --> 05:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
was presented on the behalf of dhhs
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
today i would like
 
05:04:14.788 --> 05:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
to say a few words about senate bill
 
05:04:14.798 --> 05:04:17.030 align:start position:0%
to say a few words about senate bill
430.

05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
430.
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
this omnibus bill in my opinion
 
05:04:23.110 --> 05:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
is complicated
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
and will be a burden to the taxpayers of
 
05:04:29.590 --> 05:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill had 22 parts
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then was broken down into 74
 
05:04:36.480 --> 05:04:37.590 align:start position:0%
and then was broken down into 74
sections

05:04:37.590 --> 05:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
sections
 
05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal impact as follows
 
05:04:43.750 --> 05:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
now i broke down the impact that was
 
05:04:46.470 --> 05:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
giving because i am a bookkeeper by
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
trade and we're always asking questions
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:55.270 --> 05:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
21 sections
 
05:04:56.708 --> 05:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
had no fiscal impact
 
05:05:04.948 --> 05:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
42 sections had minimal fiscal impact
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
which is impossible to imagine
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
what does a total
 
05:05:09.760 --> 05:05:10.788 align:start position:0%
what does a total
minimal

05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
05:05:12.830 --> 05:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
05:05:12.840 --> 05:05:14.390 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
mean

05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
for 42 sections of this bill i mean does
 
05:05:19.110 --> 05:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
it mean
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
50 000
 
05:05:23.590 --> 05:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars 2 million i mean we
 
05:05:27.510 --> 05:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely have no idea of this minimal
 
05:05:27.520 --> 05:05:30.550 align:start position:0%
absolutely have no idea of this minimal
impact

05:05:30.550 --> 05:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
seven sections were listed as fiscal
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
impact was indeterminable
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
and four sections of the bill were
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
estimated 2.8 million would come from a
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation
 
05:05:49.270 --> 05:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
29 000 and 700 000 would be appropriated
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23.
 
05:05:56.070 --> 05:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
we have no real absolute figures of
 
05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
estimates as to the total cost of this
 
05:05:59.280 --> 05:06:01.510 align:start position:0%

the pill the bill is cumbersome
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
and i believe personally
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
sp 430 is not wholesome and reasonable
 
05:07:09.430 --> 05:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
and it goes against the state
 
05:07:09.440 --> 05:07:11.350 align:start position:0%

we
 
05:07:21.430 --> 05:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
adding a burden

sb 430 was a wish list from the
 
05:07:55.270 --> 05:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
05:07:58.470 --> 05:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment we just passed
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
took out
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
numbers of things from this wish list
 
05:08:05.670 --> 05:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
it took out items that needed to be
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
readdressed by a different committee
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
than ours
 
05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee more subject matter expert
 
05:08:13.510 --> 05:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
than we
 
05:08:15.510 --> 05:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
we think that by doing this some
 
05:08:18.150 --> 05:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
controversial matters will now be given
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
the full hearing they deserve and oh by
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
the way
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
also a discussion
 
05:08:26.788 --> 05:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
of a good bit of the money that was just
 
05:08:30.390 --> 05:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
referenced by the previous speaker
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment also took out some items
 
05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't think were necessary or that
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
we thought could be more fully thought
 
05:08:42.070 --> 05:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
through and resubmitted at a later date
 
05:08:45.910 --> 05:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
what's left includes in part
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
some tidying up items for example
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
the authorization to remove the names of
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
facilities no longer in use from law
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
the changing of staff titles and
 
05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
definitions to be more appropriate and
 
05:09:05.430 --> 05:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
other exciting things like it
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
by the way these comprise many of the
 
05:09:07.680 --> 05:09:09.430 align:start position:0%
by the way these comprise many of the
sections

05:09:09.430 --> 05:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
sections
 
05:09:12.310 --> 05:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
but we did leave in a few matters we
 
05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
spent a long time we got out at 8 25 pm
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
we did a lot of work on this
 
05:09:22.550 --> 05:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
the bill makes it possible for more home
 
05:09:25.430 --> 05:09:25.440 align:start position:0%

05:09:25.440 --> 05:09:27.030 align:start position:0%

i do some work with this community and
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
have for the last several years so i've
 
05:10:11.590 --> 05:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
learned that there's a gap of care after

05:10:18.390 --> 05:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
and because of this
 
05:10:18.400 --> 05:10:19.510 align:start position:0%
and because of this
often

05:10:19.510 --> 05:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
often
 
05:10:22.390 --> 05:10:22.400 align:start position:0%

not an extensive and expensive program
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
but a pilot program to see if the ideas
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
they have for how to
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
close this three-year gap
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%

05:10:50.948 --> 05:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
we've slimmed things down we've kept

05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
let the

other professions healthcare workers

that is a very unique situation and one
 
05:18:44.470 --> 05:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
that requires careful consideration
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
how do we deal with a disruptive patient
 
05:18:48.310 --> 05:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
who shouts and shoves and does that
 
05:18:51.270 --> 05:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
despite attempts to de-escalate
 
05:18:53.190 --> 05:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
if anyone entering the area is exposed
 
05:18:55.830 --> 05:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
to this a responding police officer will
 
05:18:58.070 --> 05:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
see it and be able to arrest the person
 
05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
05:19:01.510 --> 05:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate
 
05:19:03.990 --> 05:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
if a visitor gets violent or mouthy they
 
05:19:05.670 --> 05:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
can be trespassed which means they have
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
to leave the property and they can't
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
come back so that solves the problem if
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's not a patient
 
05:19:13.830 --> 05:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
so neither of those scenarios justifies
 
05:19:15.750 --> 05:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
an expansion of warrantless arrest
 
05:19:15.760 --> 05:19:18.150 align:start position:0%
an expansion of warrantless arrest
powers

05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
powers
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
so for those patients who need care and
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
who fight back in some way it gets
 
05:19:22.718 --> 05:19:24.310 align:start position:0%
who fight back in some way it gets
trickier

05:19:24.310 --> 05:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
trickier
 
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
i feel for those healthcare workers
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
treating volatile patients that know how
 
05:19:30.070 --> 05:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
to act the perfect angel when an officer
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
is around
 
05:19:34.070 --> 05:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean we need to expose
 
05:19:36.390 --> 05:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
everybody else to warrantless arrest
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
just because they're in a health care
 
05:19:38.160 --> 05:19:40.550 align:start position:0%
just because they're in a health care
facility

05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
this needs careful consideration of
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
people with the right background and
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge to figure out if and how we
 
05:19:49.590 --> 05:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
would change our criminal statutes to
 
05:19:52.230 --> 05:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
reflect that tricky situation when a
 
05:19:54.310 --> 05:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
patient needs care
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
but they're also violating the rights of
 
05:19:57.750 --> 05:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
05:19:59.830 --> 05:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
i don't have the answers i'm on health
 
05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
05:20:04.550 --> 05:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to finance next
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
they're not criminal justice either
 
05:20:08.550 --> 05:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
this is something that needs to come
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
back next year so that it can go through
 
05:20:12.788 --> 05:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
criminal justice in our body and
 
05:20:15.430 --> 05:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
judiciary in the other body we can't
 
05:20:17.830 --> 05:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
make changes with this lightly we put at
 
05:20:20.550 --> 05:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
risk all of our citizens and especially
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
those that are already more vulnerable
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
this is an amendment to fix the problem
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
and remove the following words in the
 
05:20:29.830 --> 05:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
criminal code
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
this would allow warrantless arrest and
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
i quote
 
05:20:34.628 --> 05:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
while in the care of a medical
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
professional on the premises of a
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
residential care or health care facility
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
as defined in rsa 152-2 51-2 through
 
05:20:45.670 --> 05:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
actual or threatened violence interfere
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the provision of medically necessary
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
health care services
 
05:20:51.830 --> 05:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
so there's two parts of that that are a
 
05:20:53.190 --> 05:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
little confusing
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
the statute itself expands the
 
05:20:56.788 --> 05:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
definition of workplace violence to
 
05:20:58.948 --> 05:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
include harsh words
 
05:21:00.788 --> 05:21:00.798 align:start position:0%
and when you're looking at de-escalation
 
05:21:02.948 --> 05:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
and some of the other problems
 
05:21:05.030 --> 05:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
it it makes sense to look at the whole
 
05:21:07.430 --> 05:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
spectrum but if the statute for
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrests includes this
 
05:21:12.390 --> 05:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
definition where harsh words are
 
05:21:12.400 --> 05:21:13.910 align:start position:0%
definition where harsh words are
violence

05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
violence
 
05:21:16.390 --> 05:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to cause a lot of problems
 
05:21:18.548 --> 05:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
and then medically necessary health care
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
where is that defined not in our
 
05:21:20.638 --> 05:21:23.590 align:start position:0%
where is that defined not in our
statutes

05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
compassion for our healthcare heroes is
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
commendable and i agree that they
 
05:21:31.520 --> 05:21:32.830 align:start position:0%
commendable and i agree that they
deserve

05:21:32.830 --> 05:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
05:21:35.510 --> 05:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
protection but i know that all people
 
05:21:38.070 --> 05:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
deserve protection under law equal
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
protection under law is guaranteed in
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
the 14th amendment the constitution
 
05:21:44.628 --> 05:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
our rights should not change when we set
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
foot in a health care facility
 
05:21:49.110 --> 05:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
without this amendment
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
they will
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
this equal protection protects all of us
 
05:21:58.788 --> 05:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
i can't sit by and let the potential for
 
05:22:01.510 --> 05:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
a gross violation of human rights
 
05:22:03.510 --> 05:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
go through without review of criminal
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
justice and judiciary
 
05:22:08.948 --> 05:22:08.958 align:start position:0%
i ask you to defer this debate to the
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate committees by passing this
 
05:22:10.878 --> 05:22:11.990 align:start position:0%
appropriate committees by passing this
amendment

05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
which has support on both sides of the
 
05:22:13.600 --> 05:22:14.788 align:start position:0%
which has support on both sides of the

aisle
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
and then move this this important bill
 
05:22:20.788 --> 05:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
onto finance so that we can figure out
 
05:22:23.190 --> 05:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
how to protect our healthcare heroes
 
05:22:25.990 --> 05:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
without creating a new constitution
 
05:22:26.000 --> 05:22:27.190 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
05:22:32.390 --> 05:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the questions
 
05:22:32.400 --> 05:22:35.030 align:start position:0%
does the member yield the questions
yes

senator brownie main choir
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you my friend
 
05:22:41.110 --> 05:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
from derry
 
05:22:43.830 --> 05:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the warren or less clause
 
05:22:43.840 --> 05:22:45.190 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the warren or less clause
of

05:22:45.190 --> 05:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:22:46.470 --> 05:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
applies to all health care facilities
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
however the database portion of the bill
 
05:22:52.948 --> 05:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
only applies to hospitals and urgent
 
05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
care centers
 
05:22:56.310 --> 05:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
so i assume nursing homes would fall
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
under the warrantless arrest portion of
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:23:02.390 --> 05:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
my question is why are nursing homes not
 
05:23:04.788 --> 05:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
part of the database portion and did the
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire health care association
 
05:23:08.868 --> 05:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
which repo represents the nursing homes
 
05:23:11.430 --> 05:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
in the state testify either way on this
 
05:23:16.548 --> 05:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
this came out of a work group of
 
05:23:23.430 --> 05:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals and ambulatory care centers
 
05:23:25.110 --> 05:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
this does apply to all health care
 
05:23:25.120 --> 05:23:26.708 align:start position:0%
this does apply to all health care
facilities

05:23:26.708 --> 05:23:26.718 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
05:23:26.718 --> 05:23:27.510 align:start position:0%
facilities
but

05:23:27.510 --> 05:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:23:29.510 --> 05:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
those two groups asked for this and it
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
was asked for for hospitals and urgent
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
cares those are pretty much the front
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
lines of our health care system
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
but these warrantless arrests
 
05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
were these warrantless arrest powers
 
05:23:42.390 --> 05:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
would go to all health care facilities
 
05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
everybody is getting lumped into the
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
same bucket without appropriate
 
05:23:45.760 --> 05:23:47.190 align:start position:0%
same bucket without appropriate
consideration

05:23:47.190 --> 05:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
we did not hear anything from we did not
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
hear anything from that association
 
05:23:52.310 --> 05:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the warrantless arrests and i
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe that they testified in
 
05:23:56.390 --> 05:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
general on the bill as
 
05:23:57.750 --> 05:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
other than the warrantless arrest
 
05:24:02.708 --> 05:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
recognize representative weber's
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
speak against the
 
05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
floor amendment
 
05:24:12.548 --> 05:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:24:17.910 --> 05:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
we are talking about a very very small
 
05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
uh expansion of the warrantless arrest
 
05:24:20.558 --> 05:24:23.270 align:start position:0%
uh expansion of the warrantless arrest
statute

05:24:23.270 --> 05:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
it only refers to misdemeanors because
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
you can already arrest without a warrant
 
05:24:31.110 --> 05:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:24:33.430 --> 05:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
case of felonies
 
05:24:33.440 --> 05:24:34.548 align:start position:0%
case of felonies
so

05:24:34.548 --> 05:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
with respect to misdemeanors
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
law of enforcement already has the right
 
05:24:41.430 --> 05:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
to arrest
 
05:24:43.110 --> 05:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
without a warrant
 
05:24:43.120 --> 05:24:44.230 align:start position:0%
without a warrant
for

05:24:44.230 --> 05:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors that they see happening
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
so here's the scenario
 
05:24:53.110 --> 05:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
this expands
 
05:24:55.350 --> 05:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
that power simply
 
05:24:55.360 --> 05:24:56.150 align:start position:0%
that power simply
to

05:24:56.150 --> 05:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:24:56.160 --> 05:24:57.590 align:start position:0%
to
misdemeanors

05:24:57.590 --> 05:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
in health care centers
 
05:25:02.708 --> 05:25:02.718 align:start position:0%
that interfere with the delivery of
 
05:25:06.390 --> 05:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
health care that they haven't seen so
 
05:25:08.070 --> 05:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:25:09.590 --> 05:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
an outbreak
 
05:25:13.270 --> 05:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:15.190 --> 05:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement didn't see it law
 
05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement arrives
 
05:25:18.868 --> 05:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
currently they have to wait till there's
 
05:25:18.878 --> 05:25:20.070 align:start position:0%
currently they have to wait till there's
another

05:25:20.070 --> 05:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
go around
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
before they do anything about it
 
05:25:27.990 --> 05:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
and here's the problem
 
05:25:30.548 --> 05:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
health care workers
 
05:25:33.750 --> 05:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
are virtually the only victims
 
05:25:36.070 --> 05:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
of assaultative behavior
 
05:25:39.190 --> 05:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
who are ethically required to continue
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
to treat
 
05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
the person who assaulted them
 
05:25:46.948 --> 05:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
under no circumstances is anybody going
 
05:25:49.030 --> 05:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
to halt the treatment
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:54.708 --> 05:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
but what this allows
 
05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
is there can be an arrest law
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement can be there can make sure
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
that the people who are trying to
 
05:26:06.150 --> 05:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
deliver care and continue to deliver
 
05:26:06.160 --> 05:26:07.590 align:start position:0%
deliver care and continue to deliver
care

05:26:07.590 --> 05:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
can do so
 
05:26:09.360 --> 05:26:11.030 align:start position:0%
can do so
uninterrupted

05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
and unassaulted
 
05:26:15.190 --> 05:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
and remember when they are doing this
 
05:26:17.670 --> 05:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
they are delivering care not only to the
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
person who was
 
05:26:21.910 --> 05:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
committing the assault
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
but mostly in these settings there are a
 
05:26:27.270 --> 05:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
lot of other people all around them who
 
05:26:30.788 --> 05:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
also need critical care
 
05:26:30.798 --> 05:26:33.350 align:start position:0%
also need critical care
so

05:26:33.350 --> 05:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
we need to have the ability
 
05:26:39.910 --> 05:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to allow our health care
 
05:26:39.920 --> 05:26:41.270 align:start position:0%
to be able to allow our health care
workers

05:26:41.270 --> 05:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
workers
 
05:26:44.548 --> 05:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
to care for all of their patients
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
in a safe way
 
05:26:49.590 --> 05:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
that keeps not only the health care
 
05:26:51.510 --> 05:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
workers but all the other patients safe
 
05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:26:55.510 --> 05:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to accept this small
 
05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
extension to the statute by pressing the
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
green button of the
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
no the red button because it's an
 
05:27:05.190 --> 05:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
amendment so oppose the amendment by
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%

05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a roll call vote members

if i know
 
05:29:19.120 --> 05:29:20.868 align:start position:0%

that
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
size doesn't matter
 
05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
05:29:29.190 --> 05:29:29.200 align:start position:0%

05:29:31.510 --> 05:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
policy discipline
 
05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
is as bad as a big violation
 
05:29:36.390 --> 05:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
and if i knew
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%

construction of a pier on hampton beach
 
05:40:13.270 --> 05:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment would simply change the
 
05:40:16.390 --> 05:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
effective day from 60 days after its
 
05:40:20.230 --> 05:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
passage to take effect upon passage
 
05:40:22.948 --> 05:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
this simple change would first
 
05:40:25.190 --> 05:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
allow the hampton beach area commission
 
05:40:28.150 --> 05:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
to immediately commence its feasibility
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
in impact studies and second provides 60
 
05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
additional days for the commission to
 
05:40:35.830 --> 05:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
both complete
 
05:40:39.510 --> 05:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
a thorough comprehensive study and meet

05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee on the special
 
05:42:30.070 --> 05:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
committee on redistricting to which was
 
05:42:32.470 --> 05:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
referred senate bill 240
 
05:42:34.628 --> 05:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
an act portioning state senate districts
 
05:42:36.310 --> 05:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
having considered the same report the
 
05:42:38.150 --> 05:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
same with the recommendation that bill
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass senator carol mcguire for
 
05:42:42.868 --> 05:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee
 
05:42:44.788 --> 05:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee having
 
05:42:46.310 --> 05:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
considered the same being unable to
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
following resolution resolved that is
 
05:42:51.910 --> 05:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate senator lucy
 
05:42:54.390 --> 05:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
weber from the minority of the committee
 
05:43:00.708 --> 05:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:05.670 --> 05:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at the map
 
05:43:10.948 --> 05:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
that comes with the words
 
05:43:13.590 --> 05:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
that explain which towns are going to be
 
05:43:17.190 --> 05:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
in each senatorial district
 
05:43:19.830 --> 05:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
you will understand that this is the
 
05:43:24.548 --> 05:43:24.558 align:start position:0%
very picture of gerrymandering
 
05:43:28.708 --> 05:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:31.030 --> 05:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of problems here
 
05:43:32.708 --> 05:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
05:43:36.628 --> 05:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
the bill splits counties unnecessarily
 
05:43:39.350 --> 05:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
my own county goes into four different
 
05:43:42.070 --> 05:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
senatorial districts
 
05:43:42.080 --> 05:43:42.868 align:start position:0%
senatorial districts
where

05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:43:45.590 --> 05:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
and my current senator who normally who
 
05:43:45.600 --> 05:43:46.708 align:start position:0%
and my current senator who normally who
currently

05:43:46.708 --> 05:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:43:50.230 --> 05:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
serves only cheshire county towns
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
will now have two hillsborough county
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
towns imported into his district
 
05:43:57.910 --> 05:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
while other county towns have been
 
05:43:57.920 --> 05:44:01.590 align:start position:0%
while other county towns have been
exported

05:44:01.590 --> 05:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:04.470 --> 05:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
the towns are geographically sprawling
 
05:44:09.670 --> 05:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's very noisy the house will be in
 
05:44:16.868 --> 05:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
order the member has a right to speak
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
if you need to have a conversation take
 
05:44:21.430 --> 05:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
it out into the annie room
 
05:44:23.830 --> 05:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:44:25.670 --> 05:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
the districts are geographically
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
sprawling and confusing
 
05:44:31.590 --> 05:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
one district district nine
 
05:44:33.190 --> 05:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
stretches from
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
well two districts stretch
 
05:44:37.990 --> 05:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
from the connecticut river all the way
 
05:44:40.470 --> 05:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
to the middle of the state
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
one district nine is one town wide
 
05:44:46.948 --> 05:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
70 miles long and it stretches from
 
05:44:49.670 --> 05:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
hinsdale to bedford
 
05:44:52.390 --> 05:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
covering a multitude of communities that
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
the bill as presented
 
05:45:05.190 --> 05:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
is deliberately gerrymandered for
 
05:45:08.470 --> 05:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
partisan advantage creating a number of
 
05:45:08.480 --> 05:45:09.910 align:start position:0%
partisan advantage creating a number of
districts

05:45:09.910 --> 05:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
districts
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
which are weighted towards the
 
05:45:11.520 --> 05:45:13.510 align:start position:0%
which are weighted towards the
republicans

05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
republicans
 
05:45:15.990 --> 05:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
and a far smaller number of districts
 
05:45:19.030 --> 05:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
that are weighted towards the democrats
 
05:45:20.548 --> 05:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
but the districts that are weighted
 
05:45:23.990 --> 05:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
towards the democrats are much more
 
05:45:26.310 --> 05:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
partisan leaning
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
than the republican districts
 
05:45:31.590 --> 05:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
because they have been packed with every
 
05:45:35.670 --> 05:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
available democrat in the state
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
to the advantage
 
05:45:41.670 --> 05:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
of the majority party
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at our voters
 
05:45:47.510 --> 05:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
they are relatively evenly split
 
05:45:51.270 --> 05:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
between democrats and republicans
 
05:45:54.868 --> 05:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
but the largest voting bloc
 
05:45:57.350 --> 05:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
is independence
 
05:45:59.750 --> 05:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
roughly 40 percent for roughly 30
 
05:46:02.628 --> 05:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
percent of the others
 
05:46:05.910 --> 05:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
and those independents
 
05:46:10.708 --> 05:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
really have their voices taken away
 
05:46:14.230 --> 05:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
by this effort to pack
 
05:46:16.708 --> 05:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
partisan districts
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
which are not competitive
 
05:46:22.470 --> 05:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
and where we don't have to listen to the
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
majority of our voters
 
05:46:29.350 --> 05:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:31.270 --> 05:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
the special committee on redistricting
 
05:46:33.670 --> 05:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
listen to voters in every county in this
 
05:46:33.680 --> 05:46:35.830 align:start position:0%
listen to voters in every county in this
state

05:46:35.830 --> 05:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
and in every county in this state
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
republicans and democrats told us they
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
wanted local representation
 
05:46:45.910 --> 05:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
and they wanted communities of interest
 
05:46:49.030 --> 05:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:51.510 --> 05:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
this map doesn't do it
 
05:46:57.830 --> 05:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:06.708 --> 05:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:47:08.958 --> 05:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
the

05:47:11.750 --> 05:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
you'll notice the previous speaker did
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
not say that this map was
 
05:47:15.040 --> 05:47:17.030 align:start position:0%
not say that this map was
unconstitutional

05:47:17.030 --> 05:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
05:47:19.628 --> 05:47:19.638 align:start position:0%
in fact it committee they agreed it is
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional and legal it meets all
 
05:47:27.270 --> 05:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
all necessary requirements their concern
 
05:47:29.990 --> 05:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
is that it's not as good as it could be
 
05:47:30.000 --> 05:47:31.910 align:start position:0%
is that it's not as good as it could be
well

05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:47:31.920 --> 05:47:32.868 align:start position:0%
well
right

05:47:32.868 --> 05:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:47:34.708 --> 05:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
i could have done a better map at least
 
05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
by my standards the trouble is there are
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of different legal and
 
05:47:42.868 --> 05:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional maps for the senate that
 
05:47:42.878 --> 05:47:44.230 align:start position:0%
constitutional maps for the senate that
would

05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:47:44.240 --> 05:47:45.350 align:start position:0%
would
would

05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:47:46.470 --> 05:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
be legal
 
05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
there are dozens of criteria to help you
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
choose between one map and the other
 
05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:00.390 --> 05:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
this map has the approval of the
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
majority of the other body
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
they have voted for it they recommend it
 
05:48:09.270 --> 05:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
the house has confirmed that it is in
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
fact legal and constitutional
 
05:48:17.270 --> 05:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
and we have no real reason to rewrite
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
the map that the majority of the other
 
05:48:22.390 --> 05:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
body has chosen for themselves they
 
05:48:24.390 --> 05:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
didn't rewrite the map
 
05:48:26.948 --> 05:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
of house districts that we sent them
 
05:48:28.628 --> 05:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
and so in
 
05:48:30.548 --> 05:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
with respect we should just leave this
 
05:48:35.430 --> 05:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
what reason to memorize motion state
 
05:48:40.788 --> 05:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
your motion uh i would move that senate
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
bill 240 be placed upon the table
 
05:48:45.430 --> 05:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
05:48:47.510 --> 05:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
proper motion
 
05:48:50.708 --> 05:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
the motion is to lay senate bill 240 on
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
the table
 
05:48:57.190 --> 05:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
roll call has been requested by
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
senator barbara griffin is that
 
05:49:01.830 --> 05:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
05:49:04.310 --> 05:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
05:50:36.548 --> 05:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
house will be in order members take your
 
05:50:38.240 --> 05:50:47.830 align:start position:0%
house will be in order members take your
seats

05:50:47.830 --> 05:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:09.270 --> 05:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
motion before us is the table senate
 
05:51:11.350 --> 05:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
bill 240.
 
05:51:14.230 --> 05:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roll call vote
 
05:51:16.150 --> 05:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative tim
 
05:51:19.590 --> 05:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
smith for parliamentary inquiry
 
05:51:22.788 --> 05:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that a significant
 
05:51:25.590 --> 05:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
amount of extra work is needed to craft
 
05:51:26.548 --> 05:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
05:51:29.350 --> 05:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
a district bill for the senate district
 
05:51:32.150 --> 05:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
that is less likely to face immediate
 
05:51:33.830 --> 05:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
legal challenges
 
05:51:36.310 --> 05:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
and seriously delay the ability of
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
senate candidates to file
 
05:51:40.948 --> 05:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
in just a couple of weeks would i now
 
05:51:44.548 --> 05:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:46.390 --> 05:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes barbara griffin for a
 
05:51:48.150 --> 05:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that
 
05:51:52.708 --> 05:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
legal challenges are no reason to be
 
05:51:55.430 --> 05:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
tabling a bill and if i know that the
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate work and legal
 
05:51:59.110 --> 05:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
considerations have gone into a bill
 
05:51:59.120 --> 05:52:00.070 align:start position:0%
considerations have gone into a bill
which

05:52:00.070 --> 05:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:52:02.548 --> 05:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
we are required to address every 10
 
05:52:05.030 --> 05:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
years in some form another would i vote
 
05:52:08.230 --> 05:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
against the tabling motion so we can do
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
what we have been brought here to do
 
05:52:12.470 --> 05:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:14.708 --> 05:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the table senate
 
05:52:17.750 --> 05:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill 240. it's a roll call vote if
 
05:52:19.190 --> 05:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
you're in favor you press the green
 
05:52:20.708 --> 05:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
button of your post you press the red
 
05:52:22.628 --> 05:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
button warning stations are open for 30
 
05:52:22.638 --> 05:53:09.750 align:start position:0%
button warning stations are open for 30
seconds

05:53:09.750 --> 05:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:11.430 --> 05:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
all members president had an opportunity
 
05:53:16.310 --> 05:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:20.868 --> 05:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
143 voting a 170 voting a tabling motion
 
05:53:20.878 --> 05:53:22.230 align:start position:0%
143 voting a 170 voting a tabling motion
fails

05:53:22.230 --> 05:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
fails
 
05:53:23.910 --> 05:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
we've already had the debate so we're
 
05:53:26.708 --> 05:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
going to go right to the vote
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:34.150 --> 05:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
i think i heard roll call
 
05:53:35.910 --> 05:53:35.920 align:start position:0%

05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
majority report of what a pass on senate
 
05:54:43.110 --> 05:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
bill 240. it's a roll call vote the
 
05:54:45.030 --> 05:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative weber
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry
 
05:54:50.390 --> 05:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:54:53.350 --> 05:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill
 
05:54:56.070 --> 05:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
disadvantages our cities by splitting
 
05:54:58.310 --> 05:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
them up and connecting them to towns
 
05:54:59.510 --> 05:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
that they don't have anything in
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
connection with some of them quite far
 
05:55:01.920 --> 05:55:03.430 align:start position:0%
connection with some of them quite far
away

05:55:03.430 --> 05:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:55:04.948 --> 05:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill
 
05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
disadvantages our towns
 
05:55:11.030 --> 05:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
by connecting them with larger entities
 
05:55:13.670 --> 05:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
far across the state with which they do
 
05:55:16.948 --> 05:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
not share any interests
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
and if i wonder since when do the
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
members of this august body settle for
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
just the bare minimum
 
05:55:30.548 --> 05:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
rather than doing their very best to
 
05:55:33.110 --> 05:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
create a bill for the best of all of our
 
05:55:33.120 --> 05:55:34.310 align:start position:0%
create a bill for the best of all of our
people

05:55:34.310 --> 05:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button
 
05:55:40.230 --> 05:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
chair recognize the representative win
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:45.350 --> 05:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:55:47.270 --> 05:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that under the
 
05:55:49.190 --> 05:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
agreement reached between the two bodies
 
05:55:51.270 --> 05:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
of the legislature reapportionment
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
reapportionment of the senate and the
 
05:55:55.110 --> 05:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
executive council was assigned in the
 
05:55:57.030 --> 05:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
first instance of the senate and
 
05:55:59.190 --> 05:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
reapportionment of the house county
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
commissioners and the congressional
 
05:56:02.548 --> 05:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
districts was assigned in the first
 
05:56:04.868 --> 05:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
instance to the house and if i know that
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
this body has a long tradition of
 
05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
affording deference to the other body of
 
05:56:11.350 --> 05:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature when it comes to

thank you mr speaker
 
05:58:53.670 --> 05:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to start off by saying
 
05:58:55.030 --> 05:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
that if there was a gentleman's
 
05:58:57.830 --> 05:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
agreement between the two chambers that
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
we would not amend certain redistricting
 
05:59:01.910 --> 05:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
bills that they were going to take
 
05:59:03.990 --> 05:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
control of and they would respect our
 
05:59:05.830 --> 05:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
wishes for those that we would take
 
05:59:08.070 --> 05:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
control of i would just remind the house
 
05:59:10.390 --> 05:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
that in fact the state senate uh did
 
05:59:12.628 --> 05:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
change the house redistricting plan and
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
then the bill had to go to the committee
 
05:59:16.230 --> 05:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
of conference
 
05:59:17.750 --> 05:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
if senate bill
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
241 is not amended
 
05:59:22.548 --> 05:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
nine of the ten counties will be split
 
05:59:22.558 --> 05:59:23.590 align:start position:0%
nine of the ten counties will be split
apart

05:59:23.590 --> 05:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
apart
 
05:59:25.350 --> 05:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
and three gerrymandered districts would
 
05:59:28.708 --> 05:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
be created districts one two and five
 
05:59:31.430 --> 05:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
on the map for senate bill 241 district
 
05:59:33.670 --> 05:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
five looks like an alligator's head
 
05:59:35.430 --> 05:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
chomping at the foot of the district 2
 
05:59:37.990 --> 05:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
stay puft marshmallow man
 
05:59:40.548 --> 05:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
district 1 is no longer a solid north
 
05:59:42.230 --> 05:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
country district
 
05:59:44.628 --> 05:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
under senate bill 241 the town south of
 
05:59:47.030 --> 05:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
carroll and franconia and west of
 
05:59:50.150 --> 05:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
waterville valley have been moved out
 
05:59:51.990 --> 05:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
and district 1 would then extend all
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
along the eastern border south to dover
 
05:59:55.830 --> 05:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
and durham
 
05:59:57.830 --> 05:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
given the larger population areas in the
 
05:59:59.910 --> 05:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
southeastern portion of the state the
 
06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
north country could find itself without
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
a seat on the executive council
 
06:00:06.708 --> 06:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
the amendment would establish five
 
06:00:08.230 --> 06:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
executive council districts that are
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
constructed to keep as many counties
 
06:00:11.750 --> 06:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
together as possible
 
06:00:13.830 --> 06:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
seven of the state's ten counties remain
 
06:00:16.548 --> 06:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
whole within council districts whereas
 
06:00:19.030 --> 06:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
under senate bill 241
 
06:00:22.788 --> 06:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:24.628 --> 06:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
district one for example incorporates
 
06:00:26.948 --> 06:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
five entire counties coast carroll
 
06:00:30.230 --> 06:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
grafton belknap and sullivan counties
 
06:00:31.910 --> 06:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
under the amendment district 2 which
 
06:00:33.590 --> 06:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
currently slithers across the width of
 
06:00:35.190 --> 06:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
the state from hinsdale and charleston
 
06:00:37.910 --> 06:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the west to somersworth in dover in
 
06:00:40.708 --> 06:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
the east will become much more compact
 
06:00:42.470 --> 06:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
and encompass merrimack and stafford
 
06:00:44.310 --> 06:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
counties in the northwestern part of
 
06:00:44.320 --> 06:00:45.990 align:start position:0%
counties in the northwestern part of
rockingham

06:00:45.990 --> 06:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
rockingham
 
06:00:47.830 --> 06:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
district three remains similar to the
 
06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
existing district though three towns are
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
moved to balanced population shifts
 
06:00:54.628 --> 06:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
district four becomes more compact
 
06:00:55.910 --> 06:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
the only town that would not share a
 
06:00:58.230 --> 06:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
border with manchester is derry
 
06:00:59.670 --> 06:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
and finally district five would
 
06:01:01.350 --> 06:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
encompass the entirety of cheshire
 
06:01:03.350 --> 06:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
county and the vast majority of
 
06:01:06.390 --> 06:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county including nashua
 
06:01:08.548 --> 06:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
the mapathon citizen mapping project
 
06:01:09.910 --> 06:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
06:01:12.390 --> 06:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
that the amendment is quote relatively
 
06:01:14.310 --> 06:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
competitive with a slight lean towards
 
06:01:17.350 --> 06:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
republicans so this is not a democratic
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
map it is just a better map
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%

241.

06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
241.
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
i would just add to that
 
06:05:17.270 --> 06:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
that some of the other issues with with
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
this bill are that it splits 17
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
high school supervisory unions
 
06:05:25.990 --> 06:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
it gerrymanders democratic leaning towns
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
into one district thereby making it
 
06:05:31.430 --> 06:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
unrealistic for a republican to win in
 
06:05:32.868 --> 06:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
that district
 
06:05:34.948 --> 06:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned before it's splitting
 
06:05:36.868 --> 06:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
up nine of our ten counties
 
06:05:38.788 --> 06:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
i would ask therefore that you vote in
 
06:05:41.590 --> 06:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to the motion of what to pass
 
06:05:43.350 --> 06:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you

senate bill 241 updates the executive
 
06:05:55.910 --> 06:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
council or districts based on the
 
06:05:57.910 --> 06:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
population data that was provided to us
 
06:06:01.350 --> 06:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
in 2020 federal census
 
06:06:03.910 --> 06:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
the senate proposed districts distribute
 
06:06:06.150 --> 06:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's population evenly with
 
06:06:07.750 --> 06:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
an acceptable
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
deviation to five executive councilor
 
06:06:12.628 --> 06:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
districts and that deviation is just
 
06:06:15.670 --> 06:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
slightly above one percent
 
06:06:17.110 --> 06:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
regarding the current executive
 
06:06:19.030 --> 06:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
counselor map one of the complaints we
 
06:06:20.948 --> 06:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
frequently heard
 
06:06:23.670 --> 06:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
during our public listening sessions
 
06:06:25.830 --> 06:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
was that district two stretches and
 
06:06:27.750 --> 06:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
snakes from the vermont border over to
 
06:06:30.230 --> 06:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire seacoast that district
 
06:06:32.948 --> 06:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
no longer exists
 
06:06:35.110 --> 06:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
now contrary to the fear grenades that
 
06:06:36.868 --> 06:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
have been lobbed onto the house floor
 
06:06:40.948 --> 06:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
today about gerrymandering and uh
 
06:06:43.670 --> 06:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
and packing of districts
 
06:06:45.910 --> 06:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
the senate has previously approved these
 
06:06:48.548 --> 06:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
districts and there are no
 
06:06:50.390 --> 06:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
zero legal basis
 
06:06:52.548 --> 06:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
that warrants what modification by the
 
06:06:52.558 --> 06:06:53.590 align:start position:0%
that warrants what modification by the
committee

06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:06:56.548 --> 06:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
as the map meets all federal and state
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements
 
06:07:01.510 --> 06:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of the special committee on
 
06:07:03.190 --> 06:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
redistricting therefore asks that you
 
06:07:03.200 --> 06:07:04.230 align:start position:0%
redistricting therefore asks that you
support

06:07:04.230 --> 06:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:07:07.110 --> 06:07:07.120 align:start position:0%

06:07:22.390 --> 06:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
are you
 
06:07:25.430 --> 06:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
i was waiting for that
 
06:07:27.110 --> 06:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who called it but a royal
 
06:07:29.350 --> 06:07:29.360 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
06:08:25.830 --> 06:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:27.910 --> 06:08:27.920 align:start position:0%

speaker
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know the redistricting
 
06:08:41.190 --> 06:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
committee held public listening sessions
 
06:08:43.510 --> 06:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
in every county with granite staters
 
06:08:45.270 --> 06:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
providing us clear direction on the
 
06:08:47.670 --> 06:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
criteria they wanted us to use when
 
06:08:49.990 --> 06:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
drawing maps for the next decade
 
06:08:52.470 --> 06:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
if i heard our constituents ask us to
 
06:08:54.948 --> 06:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
keep districts compact to keep counties
 
06:08:57.750 --> 06:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
together and to reject partisanship as
 
06:09:01.110 --> 06:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
the dominant factor in drawing new lines
 
06:09:02.548 --> 06:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
i see
 
06:09:04.868 --> 06:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
that the map in front of me
 
06:09:07.190 --> 06:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
looks like a jigsaw puzzle
 
06:09:09.910 --> 06:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
splitting 9 out of 10 counties also be
 
06:09:14.948 --> 06:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:17.190 --> 06:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
into multiple districts
 
06:09:18.708 --> 06:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
with the obvious partisan goal of
 
06:09:20.788 --> 06:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
packing as many democrats into district
 
06:09:22.548 --> 06:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
two as possible
 
06:09:24.708 --> 06:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that new ham that the
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire deserve fair
 
06:09:31.270 --> 06:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
logical districts and that this ain't it
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
would i now press the red button
 
06:09:39.030 --> 06:09:39.040 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
06:09:49.030 --> 06:09:49.040 align:start position:0%

before with regard to this to the senate
 
06:09:54.788 --> 06:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
redistricting applies here and if i know
 
06:09:56.868 --> 06:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
that the other the other body's work as
 
06:09:59.110 --> 06:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
reflected in this bill reapportions
 
06:10:01.670 --> 06:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
executive council districts so that all
 
06:10:04.230 --> 06:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
districts are contiguous and so that so
 
06:10:06.548 --> 06:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
that all constitutional requirements are
 
06:10:08.948 --> 06:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
met the deviation between districts
 
06:10:11.510 --> 06:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
being only slightly above one percent
 
06:10:12.948 --> 06:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
than what i passed
 
06:10:14.470 --> 06:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
would i press the green button to

06:12:16.310 --> 06:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
06:12:19.350 --> 06:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
i have friends
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
that have done this and i'm considering
 
06:12:26.070 --> 06:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
registering my 2007
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%

06:12:30.390 --> 06:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
06:12:32.310 --> 06:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to remain a resident of
 
06:12:33.750 --> 06:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:12:37.590 --> 06:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:38.830 --> 06:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
i own an
 
06:12:42.070 --> 06:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
llc i'm going to sell my truck to the
 
06:12:42.080 --> 06:12:44.708 align:start position:0%
llc i'm going to sell my truck to the
llc

06:12:44.708 --> 06:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
llc
 
06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
the llc
 
06:12:47.670 --> 06:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
can register
 
06:12:49.830 --> 06:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
that vehicle
 
06:12:53.190 --> 06:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:54.708 --> 06:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
maine is one
 
06:12:57.510 --> 06:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
delaware vermont is another minnesota is
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
another the minnesota is the best one
 
06:13:02.788 --> 06:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
and there's four others
 
06:13:06.390 --> 06:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
so mr speaker why i'm saying this
 
06:13:07.510 --> 06:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
is why
 
06:13:09.830 --> 06:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
my friends have done it some
 
06:13:11.990 --> 06:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
and others are looking into it and i see
 
06:13:14.868 --> 06:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of people doing this
 
06:13:16.548 --> 06:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
is then that way they can get away from
 
06:13:20.070 --> 06:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:21.510 --> 06:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
because you don't have to register your
 
06:13:23.270 --> 06:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle up there
 
06:13:26.390 --> 06:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
so with that said mr speaker
 
06:13:28.390 --> 06:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
that is what's going to happen
 
06:13:31.110 --> 06:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
when this bill passes
 
06:13:33.830 --> 06:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
and let me further explain why i know
 
06:13:36.948 --> 06:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
this to be true
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
i've read i'm almost positive when i've
 
06:13:41.910 --> 06:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
been studying this it was in a union
 
06:13:45.670 --> 06:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:45.680 --> 06:13:46.628 align:start position:0%
 
the

06:13:46.628 --> 06:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:13:49.510 --> 06:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
connecticut police were quoted in that
 
06:13:49.520 --> 06:13:51.350 align:start position:0%
connecticut police were quoted in that
article

06:13:51.350 --> 06:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
article
 
06:13:53.430 --> 06:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
saying that they have
 
06:13:55.270 --> 06:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
pretty much this bill
 
06:13:57.590 --> 06:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
that if you don't pay certain taxes
 
06:13:59.830 --> 06:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're gonna pull your registration so
 
06:14:04.628 --> 06:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
you can't work to pay those taxes
 
06:14:07.350 --> 06:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
the police in the article said you drive
 
06:14:09.990 --> 06:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
down any road in connecticut and you
 
06:14:12.788 --> 06:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
will see one to three
 
06:14:17.990 --> 06:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
main license plates on every vehicle
 
06:14:19.830 --> 06:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
so they're trying they're found a
 
06:14:22.628 --> 06:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
loophole to get around this law
 
06:14:23.910 --> 06:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what's going to happen here
 
06:14:26.628 --> 06:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
mr speaker and if you really look at a
 
06:14:28.548 --> 06:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
lot of the tractor trailers
 
06:14:30.868 --> 06:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
if you look at the trailers
 
06:14:32.788 --> 06:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
virtually every one of them has a main
 
06:14:34.070 --> 06:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
license plate
 
06:14:36.230 --> 06:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the trucks they all
 
06:14:39.990 --> 06:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:41.990 --> 06:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire is losing a lot of
 
06:14:44.830 --> 06:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:47.830 --> 06:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
this so what i'd like to do mr speaker
 
06:14:50.230 --> 06:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
to finish this up on my opposition of
 
06:14:51.510 --> 06:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
06:14:51.520 --> 06:14:52.868 align:start position:0%
senate bill
442

06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
442
 
06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
is to tell you what new hampshire
 
06:15:00.150 --> 06:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
06:15:01.680 --> 06:15:02.628 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
quote

06:15:02.628 --> 06:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
quote
 
06:15:05.190 --> 06:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
bill and dispute should not be handled
 
06:15:07.910 --> 06:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
by invoking the heavy-handed power of
 
06:15:10.708 --> 06:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
the state to deny the right of travel
 
06:15:13.030 --> 06:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
and potentially cause a vehicle owner to
 
06:15:16.070 --> 06:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
lose their job collections of unpaid
 
06:15:18.868 --> 06:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
bills is a civil matter and should be
 
06:15:21.030 --> 06:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
handled accordingly
 
06:15:23.670 --> 06:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i owned the tree business for
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
25 years plus
 
06:15:27.670 --> 06:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
in when i
 
06:15:30.548 --> 06:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
did not get paid it was extremely rare a
 
06:15:32.628 --> 06:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
matter of fact once i went to small
 
06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
claims because it was a civil matter
 
06:15:38.310 --> 06:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i won that case and i got
 
06:15:38.320 --> 06:15:40.310 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i won that case and i got
paid

06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
paid
 
06:15:44.150 --> 06:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
this is in the uh new hampshire liberty
 
06:15:46.320 --> 06:15:47.510 align:start position:0%
this is in the uh new hampshire liberty
alliance

06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
alliance
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is a heavy-handed action
 
06:15:54.150 --> 06:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:58.708 --> 06:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:01.030 --> 06:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
to deny somebody travel so if you don't
 
06:16:02.708 --> 06:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
pay your tolls which i
 
06:16:04.948 --> 06:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
say you need to pay your tolls
 
06:16:06.230 --> 06:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know because that's the right way to
 
06:16:07.350 --> 06:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
do it
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know i i believe in the toll system
 
06:16:11.830 --> 06:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
but this is not the right way
 
06:16:11.840 --> 06:16:12.628 align:start position:0%
but this is not the right way
and

06:16:12.628 --> 06:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:16:17.670 --> 06:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:19.750 --> 06:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
i apologize i can't remember it was six
 
06:16:21.830 --> 06:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
or seven years ago
 
06:16:23.430 --> 06:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
but i went through the tolls in the
 
06:16:27.990 --> 06:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
morning and it was approximately 1001
 
06:16:31.510 --> 06:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
in eight hundredths of a second
 
06:16:33.350 --> 06:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
i got ticketed
 
06:16:35.510 --> 06:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
for not having an easy pass
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
which i did have an easy pass
 
06:16:42.590 --> 06:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
because my easy pass registered at 10.01
 
06:16:45.830 --> 06:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
900 of a second
 
06:16:49.590 --> 06:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
it was like a 25 30 40 fine
 
06:16:49.600 --> 06:16:50.948 align:start position:0%
it was like a 25 30 40 fine
and

06:16:50.948 --> 06:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:16:53.830 --> 06:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
i went to the dmv
 
06:16:55.830 --> 06:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know to the toll lady and i said
 
06:16:55.840 --> 06:16:57.030 align:start position:0%
you know to the toll lady and i said
look

06:16:57.030 --> 06:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
look
 
06:16:59.110 --> 06:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
i got a picture right here on the new
 
06:17:00.868 --> 06:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire easy pass
 
06:17:03.670 --> 06:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
showing that i paid the toll and it was
 
06:17:05.910 --> 06:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
100 of a second different from your
 
06:17:05.920 --> 06:17:07.190 align:start position:0%
100 of a second different from your
ticket

06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
06:17:08.548 --> 06:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
and she goes well we're gonna have to
 
06:17:10.628 --> 06:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
take this under can uh you know advise
 
06:17:13.430 --> 06:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
me you know look into this but you'll
 
06:17:14.788 --> 06:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
probably win
 
06:17:16.868 --> 06:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
well i wasn't gonna pay that
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
so at some point they would have pulled
 
06:17:21.430 --> 06:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
my registration mr speaker because i
 
06:17:23.350 --> 06:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to pay because i had proof
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
i paid it it was on my debit card and i
 
06:17:28.230 --> 06:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
had a picture of them showing it being
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
paid but because their computer was off
 
06:17:33.030 --> 06:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
they ticketed me
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then they did say
 
06:17:37.750 --> 06:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
as i said does this happen a lot and she
 
06:17:40.948 --> 06:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
goes oh it's killing us right now a lot
 
06:17:42.708 --> 06:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
of people are getting this
 
06:17:44.548 --> 06:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
i believe they've corrected it because i
 
06:17:46.310 --> 06:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't hear any complaints about it but
 
06:17:48.708 --> 06:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
mr speaker that's what's going to happen
 
06:17:50.230 --> 06:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
is people are going to register their
 
06:17:52.390 --> 06:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles somewhere else because they
 
06:17:53.910 --> 06:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
legally can
 
06:17:55.910 --> 06:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker so i hope you
 
06:17:58.948 --> 06:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
oppose this and press red thank you is
 
06:18:02.948 --> 06:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%

maybe i missed it is there a dollar
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
figure that they have to exceed in value
 
06:18:19.030 --> 06:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
before they start interrupting your life
 
06:18:20.150 --> 06:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
06:18:22.948 --> 06:18:22.958 align:start position:0%
suspending your registration and
 
06:18:25.030 --> 06:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
preventing sale of the car
 
06:18:27.830 --> 06:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
i do not see so one
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
not paying one easy password could
 
06:18:33.190 --> 06:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh follow up your registration and yes i
 
06:18:34.868 --> 06:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
will follow up
 
06:18:37.750 --> 06:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you remember for the question
 
06:18:39.910 --> 06:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up so if i went
 
06:18:42.150 --> 06:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
through the toll once and maybe
 
06:18:43.350 --> 06:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
two dollars
 
06:18:44.390 --> 06:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
they could
 
06:18:46.628 --> 06:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
totally screw up a sale of a vehicle or
 
06:18:49.190 --> 06:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
suspend my registration etc
 
06:18:51.110 --> 06:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's what could happen they could pull
 
06:18:53.590 --> 06:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
your registration there is no
 
06:18:55.350 --> 06:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
monetary you know saying that it has to
 
06:18:58.468 --> 06:18:58.478 align:start position:0%
exceed a particular date or a particular
 
06:18:58.478 --> 06:18:59.670 align:start position:0%
exceed a particular date or a particular
amount

06:18:59.670 --> 06:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
amount
 
06:19:01.190 --> 06:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you remember yield to
 
06:19:04.070 --> 06:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
further questions yes
 
06:19:09.110 --> 06:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:11.510 --> 06:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for for taking my question um
 
06:19:13.430 --> 06:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
i was very deeply concerned to hear that
 
06:19:15.270 --> 06:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
you might have lost your license over a
 
06:19:17.910 --> 06:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
single unpaid easy pass toll
 
06:19:19.990 --> 06:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh but i i seem to recall reading
 
06:19:21.430 --> 06:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
something in the bill
 
06:19:24.150 --> 06:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
um that it's a little bit more involved
 
06:19:26.150 --> 06:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
than that to actually lose your license
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
about needing like multiple rounds of
 
06:19:30.548 --> 06:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
going through and being a serial
 
06:19:32.390 --> 06:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
violator and having to go months and
 
06:19:34.310 --> 06:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
months and getting notice after notice
 
06:19:38.150 --> 06:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
unpaid and unresolved um i'm curious
 
06:19:40.708 --> 06:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
what part of the bill like led you to
 
06:19:42.390 --> 06:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that you would have lost
 
06:19:44.628 --> 06:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
your license after only a single
 
06:19:49.430 --> 06:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:52.070 --> 06:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i said you lose your
 
06:19:54.150 --> 06:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
license i apologize it's only you lose
 
06:19:56.070 --> 06:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
your registration
 
06:19:56.080 --> 06:19:56.868 align:start position:0%
your registration
yeah

06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:19:58.708 --> 06:19:58.718 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:20:02.310 --> 06:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:05.110 --> 06:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
they can do it anytime
 
06:20:12.468 --> 06:20:12.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:20.468 --> 06:20:20.478 align:start position:0%

06:20:31.590 --> 06:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
were two quotes
 
06:20:35.110 --> 06:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
that came to my mind as i was preparing
 
06:20:36.788 --> 06:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
one from the late
 
06:20:36.798 --> 06:20:38.070 align:start position:0%
one from the late
great

06:20:38.070 --> 06:20:38.080 align:start position:0%

06:20:40.230 --> 06:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
author and clergyman
 
06:20:43.110 --> 06:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
norman vincent peale who once said empty
 
06:20:46.230 --> 06:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
pockets never held anyone back
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
only empty heads and empty hearts can do
 
06:20:48.958 --> 06:20:50.948 align:start position:0%
only empty heads and empty hearts can do
that

06:20:50.948 --> 06:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:20:53.270 --> 06:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
the second is from the late and great
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
life philosopher
 
06:20:57.110 --> 06:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
yogi berra
 
06:20:59.670 --> 06:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
where yogi said once a nickel is not
 
06:21:03.750 --> 06:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:04.948 --> 06:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:21:07.990 --> 06:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
is all about closing loopholes
 
06:21:11.110 --> 06:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
that serial toll evaders have been taken
 
06:21:13.430 --> 06:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
advantage of
 
06:21:16.468 --> 06:21:16.478 align:start position:0%
it prohibits the transfer
 
06:21:19.190 --> 06:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
of ownership of a vehicle to a family
 
06:21:22.468 --> 06:21:22.478 align:start position:0%
member so basically if i am a serial
 
06:21:24.868 --> 06:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
tolerator i could sell my ownership to
 
06:21:27.030 --> 06:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
my vehicle for one dollar to a family
 
06:21:29.270 --> 06:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
member get new plates
 
06:21:31.830 --> 06:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
and not have to pay the outstanding
 
06:21:31.840 --> 06:21:33.910 align:start position:0%
and not have to pay the outstanding
tolls

06:21:33.910 --> 06:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
06:21:36.070 --> 06:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
in testimony the department of
 
06:21:38.230 --> 06:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
transportation stated in the last year
 
06:21:41.990 --> 06:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
we had 33 000 plates
 
06:21:45.430 --> 06:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
that have evaded paying tolls
 
06:21:47.190 --> 06:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
the year before
 
06:21:51.350 --> 06:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
we had approximately fifty thousand
 
06:21:53.510 --> 06:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
my colleagues this has lost revenue to
 
06:21:56.708 --> 06:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:58.830 --> 06:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
these plates are people who are
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
willfully trying to evade paying tolls
 
06:22:06.310 --> 06:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
in using our toll roads
 
06:22:08.468 --> 06:22:08.478 align:start position:0%
this bill does allow
 
06:22:10.070 --> 06:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
in order of the vehicle to have a
 
06:22:12.310 --> 06:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
hearing so they do have jurisprudence if
 
06:22:14.150 --> 06:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
they want to talk about the various
 
06:22:16.628 --> 06:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
tolls and go through this
 
06:22:19.350 --> 06:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
so in closing i ask you to support the
 
06:22:22.150 --> 06:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan committee recommendation of
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%

06:47:12.230 --> 06:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
for it now first the nation brings jobs

and it helps our voters be engaged
 
06:47:28.390 --> 06:47:28.400 align:start position:0%

06:47:39.750 --> 06:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
calendar keeping iowa
 
06:47:43.830 --> 06:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire south carolina and nevada
 
06:47:48.788 --> 06:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:50.468 --> 06:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
in contrast
 
06:47:53.670 --> 06:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
the national democratic committee
 
06:47:56.788 --> 06:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
has thrown open the door to a challenge
 
06:47:59.910 --> 06:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
to our first in the nation status
 
06:48:02.628 --> 06:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
they've given us two months to
 
06:48:02.638 --> 06:48:03.830 align:start position:0%
they've given us two months to
to

06:48:03.830 --> 06:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:48:05.990 --> 06:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
prove our case as to why new hampshire
 
06:48:08.868 --> 06:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
should be the first primary state
 
06:48:10.548 --> 06:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
and they're opening up the idea that it
 
06:48:14.548 --> 06:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
could be multiple states running at once
 
06:48:16.708 --> 06:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
now our secretary of state
 
06:48:18.708 --> 06:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
secretary scanlan has
 
06:48:20.868 --> 06:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed his support for keeping our
 
06:48:23.030 --> 06:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
first to the nation status and and by
 
06:48:24.468 --> 06:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
statute were
 
06:48:28.070 --> 06:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
required by state law to be first
 
06:48:30.468 --> 06:48:30.478 align:start position:0%
but the dnc
 
06:48:32.150 --> 06:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
and its
 
06:48:35.430 --> 06:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
obsession with identity politics
 
06:48:39.830 --> 06:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:41.510 --> 06:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
we've already had one objection it's
 
06:48:44.708 --> 06:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:50.310 --> 06:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:53.110 --> 06:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:55.910 --> 06:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
the member may continue i would just ask
 
06:48:57.990 --> 06:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
that he
 
06:49:00.708 --> 06:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
be cautious as to what he is saying
 
06:49:02.628 --> 06:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
so let me clarify
 
06:49:05.350 --> 06:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
this is not this is not an attack on
 
06:49:06.788 --> 06:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
anyone in this room we've already
 
06:49:09.110 --> 06:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
affirmed as a body that
 
06:49:10.390 --> 06:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
first of the nation should be in new
 
06:49:11.990 --> 06:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire so this isn't an attack
 
06:49:13.430 --> 06:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
personally this is an attack about
 
06:49:15.670 --> 06:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
national level politics not an attack
 
06:49:18.868 --> 06:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
but a comment on national level politics
 
06:49:20.868 --> 06:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
that identity politics
 
06:49:23.110 --> 06:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be the reason
 
06:49:26.628 --> 06:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
if we lose first to the nation status so
 
06:49:27.750 --> 06:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
06:49:29.910 --> 06:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
respect each other as individuals and
 
06:49:33.110 --> 06:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
not as members of groups
 
06:49:34.868 --> 06:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
and reaffirmed that
 
06:49:37.030 --> 06:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
we support persons we
 
06:49:37.040 --> 06:49:39.030 align:start position:0%
we support persons we
could

06:49:39.030 --> 06:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:49:39.040 --> 06:49:39.910 align:start position:0%
could
if

06:49:39.910 --> 06:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:49:42.548 --> 06:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
everybody continues to leave
 
06:49:44.868 --> 06:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
we will lose a quorum and then we will
 
06:49:47.430 --> 06:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
be unable to move forward with what we
 
06:49:51.270 --> 06:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
need to move forward with all right
 
06:49:54.390 --> 06:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
may i just conclude
 
06:49:55.910 --> 06:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we just celebrated the 100th
 
06:49:58.830 --> 06:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
anniversary of first the nation uh in in
 
06:50:01.670 --> 06:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
2020 even though we're a small
 
06:50:01.680 --> 06:50:03.110 align:start position:0%
2020 even though we're a small
state

06:50:03.110 --> 06:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:50:06.070 --> 06:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
and we have a population of 1.3 million
 
06:50:07.750 --> 06:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
we have affordable markets we have a
 
06:50:10.468 --> 06:50:10.478 align:start position:0%
seasoned diverse citizenry and a proven
 
06:50:13.430 --> 06:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
ability to vet candidates for president
 
06:50:15.430 --> 06:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
we have the largest state legislature in
 
06:50:17.830 --> 06:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
the nation and we sponsor a thousand
 
06:50:19.830 --> 06:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
bills a year we have
 
06:50:20.788 --> 06:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
we have
 
06:50:24.708 --> 06:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
acumen at deciding on legislation
 
06:50:26.390 --> 06:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to be wealthy to run
 
06:50:28.708 --> 06:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's a small market
 
06:50:30.948 --> 06:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
any natural born citizen who dreams of
 
06:50:32.390 --> 06:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
being president
 
06:50:34.390 --> 06:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the united states can compete for our
 
06:50:34.400 --> 06:50:36.230 align:start position:0%
of the united states can compete for our
nomination

06:50:36.230 --> 06:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
nomination
 
06:50:39.190 --> 06:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
we have reliably winnowed down the field
 
06:50:41.030 --> 06:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
of potential candidates
 
06:50:43.030 --> 06:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
and the ones that survive the vetting
 
06:50:44.948 --> 06:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
process from our new hampshire
 
06:50:46.628 --> 06:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
constituents are better for the
 
06:50:46.638 --> 06:50:47.910 align:start position:0%
constituents are better for the
experience

06:50:47.910 --> 06:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
experience
 
06:50:50.948 --> 06:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
and so i i
 
06:50:53.190 --> 06:50:53.200 align:start position:0%

06:50:55.590 --> 06:50:55.600 align:start position:0%

06:52:32.390 --> 06:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
who never thought i was going to be a
 
06:52:34.868 --> 06:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
member of this house
 
06:52:37.190 --> 06:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's how i want to start and second of
 
06:52:37.200 --> 06:52:37.990 align:start position:0%
that's how i want to start and second of
all

06:52:37.990 --> 06:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:52:39.910 --> 06:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
i want to say thank you
 
06:52:41.510 --> 06:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
for the members
 
06:52:44.230 --> 06:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
of the house for each side of the party
 
06:52:46.948 --> 06:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
not just democrat but republicans who
 
06:52:48.548 --> 06:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
reach out to me
 
06:52:53.110 --> 06:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
after i have to take a hard decision
 
06:52:56.788 --> 06:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
for my caucus to leave the nhdp
 
06:52:58.868 --> 06:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
we left the executive committee of the
 
06:53:01.350 --> 06:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
democratic party
 
06:53:03.030 --> 06:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
the reason that we left the executive
 
06:53:05.190 --> 06:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
committee of democratic party is because
 
06:53:07.590 --> 06:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
my caucus doesn't feel welcomed by the
 
06:53:09.510 --> 06:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
democratic party
 
06:53:12.628 --> 06:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
our voices try to be shut down
 
06:53:15.190 --> 06:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
we can do that
 
06:53:17.350 --> 06:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
i believe our community has been
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
tokenized by by many and it's time for
 
06:53:23.270 --> 06:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
us to win the respect
 
06:53:26.390 --> 06:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
they only come in us
 
06:53:28.468 --> 06:53:28.478 align:start position:0%
our opinions when they start to vote
 
06:53:31.030 --> 06:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
they only come and ask for a boat
 
06:53:33.110 --> 06:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
but they're never counting on voices
 
06:53:35.990 --> 06:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to make decisions
 
06:53:38.948 --> 06:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
i will i will say thank you because it's
 
06:53:41.350 --> 06:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
never been easy for me
 
06:53:42.830 --> 06:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
to open the
