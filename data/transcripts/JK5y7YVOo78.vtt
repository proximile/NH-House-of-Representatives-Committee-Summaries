00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
all right good morning everybody
 
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.370 align:start position:0%
all right good morning everybody
um

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
glad to notice that we have a quorum and
 
00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'm opening the public hearing on hcr2
 
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chair members of the committee
 
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here to today present uh
 
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
house soon resolution number two
 
00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
and uh I can be very brief I think
 
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
and uh pardon my word processing and
 
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's been two days without electric at
 
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
as a teacher
 
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
I used to look over my class and see
 
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
what students had uh names that I needed
 
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
to learn first
 
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
uh and as a business adventure as a bit
 
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
of an adventurous student myself
 
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
I could sometimes understand their
 
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.170 align:start position:0%
I could sometimes understand their
struggle

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
struggle
 
00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
but it was not until I was a parent
 
00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.289 align:start position:0%
but it was not until I was a parent
myself

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
that I realized that every child had a
 
00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 align:start position:0%
parent that possibly loved their child
 
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
as much as I love mine
 
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
these students were my lesson in
 
00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
compassion and forgiveness
 
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
this bill before you was not a gotcha
 
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.910 align:start position:0%
this bill before you was not a gotcha
legislation

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
it isn't meant to make anyone look bad
 
00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
it's our joint opportunity to practice a
 
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
little that compassion and forgiveness
 
00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
that I still believe is so lacking in
 
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
it won't erase past statements or made
 
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the aisle hopefully
 
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
though it will allow us to move beyond
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
our own toxic Behavior as we all strive
 
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
to be better versions of ourself
 
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that pretty much I think sums up but
 
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
I hope this amendment is about
 
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to say questions thank you
 
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
ah

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
all right representative O'Brien thank
 
00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh and representative
 
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh I'm
 
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
just briefly in my overview of this
 
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
what's different in this bill as
 
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
compared to common law on vandalism and
 
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.589 align:start position:0%
compared to common law on vandalism and
everything

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
and you know I don't see fines and I
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
think that's also codified and some
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
already existing state law
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
if you could explain that please I would
 
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 align:start position:0%
agree with you and I think that um as
 
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
far as
 
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.110 align:start position:0%
far as
um

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
laws against this type of behavior I
 
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
think they're probably fairly
 
00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 align:start position:0%
when enforced I think they're probably
 
00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
will do the job we want but this is not
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
a bill to enact legislation this is a
 
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 align:start position:0%
resolution and I believe that's
 
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't carry quite the legislative
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
teeth that a bill would carry and that
 
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
would be my intent to not carry those
 
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
teeth I think this is more of a moment
 
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
for us to all reflect on where we'd like
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
to go as a legislative body
 
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
I think we all agree there has has been
 
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
a bit of acrobatic acrimony in the past
 
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
within the chamber
 
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
and uh I think the fortunate thing about
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
resolutions is they generally do stay
 
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
within the chamber
 
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh they're not considered by other
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
bodies and they are often not used to
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
enact laws
 
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
I think that's the advantage of a
 
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
resolution in this particular case I
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
would normally count that as this
 
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.809 align:start position:0%
would normally count that as this
advantage

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question it
 
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
does thank you
 
00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
um obviously this is a very important
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
subject the resolution is in the past
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
tense so can you speak to that why we
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
would put a bill in that speaks to the
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
past tense and
 
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.409 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's in the present tense I I you know I
 
00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
I think it is a good point there thank
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.550 align:start position:0%
you for the question
um

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
I by the time when this was drafted
 
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
there were several incidents some
 
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
happening in my own County that were
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
very fresh in my mind and perhaps at
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
that time I was considering more the
 
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
freshness of those particular events
 
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
um weren't I to redraft it I would
 
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
definitely consider what you say I
 
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
however I don't think it makes the
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
impact of what this resolution is trying
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
to do any less significant I would hope
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
 
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.650 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative thank
you

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
on HCR too
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
all right then I will close the public
 
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.330 align:start position:0%
all right then I will close the public
hearing

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:52.610 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
okay well in that case we have 25
 
00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 align:start position:0%
minutes until our next hearing
 
00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.469 align:start position:0%
minutes until our next hearing
so

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
sorry about the delay
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
we were chatting uh so I'm opening the
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
hearing on on house resolution 11 and I
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
committee members for um
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
being here and I want to give a quick
 
00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:10.940 align:start position:0%
um history behind this this resolution
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
was introduced
 
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
that last term term before and it was a
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
HCR and it passed the house uh
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
um close to unanimous 342 to 10 or
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
something and because it was a HCR and
 
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.370 align:start position:0%
something and because it was a HCR and
the

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:33.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
the Senate did not take up on their side
 
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
it died
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
on the table or having passed the house
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
so this time I have brought it as a
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
house resolution only
 
00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:52.579 align:start position:0%
so basically what it does is
 
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that
 
00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
welcoming communities exist
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
in United States and I can proudly say
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
Nashua is one of the first cities
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
officially becoming welcoming community
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
and in
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and
 
00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:20.780 align:start position:0%
there are five six other communities
 
00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:25.820 align:start position:0%
that are on the path like Manchester
 
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
conquered uh
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
so basically what this resolution does
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
is to acknowledge the immigrants
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
acknowledge their contribution and
 
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:42.140 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that a New Hampshire
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
celebrates diversity just a quick fact
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
since 20 uh the 2020 census
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
showed that there are
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
the diversity or the population change
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
shift demographic shift happened in New
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire before it used to be 98 White
 
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
and then it came down to 95 percent
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 census showed 86 percent so
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
and also what the immigrants did to New
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is helped with keeping the
 
00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:31.460 align:start position:0%
negative population growth and influx of
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
younger Workforce into the state
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
and in Nashua it happened with
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
um we if the immigrants were not
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
accounted for we would have 5 000 out of
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
90 000 population negative growth
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
and because of the Immigrant population
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
the 5000 negative
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
was offset by the immigrants so it's
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's happening
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
and embrace it and celebrate it and I am
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
one of the faces of first generation
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
immigrant and so
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know I'm a productive contributing
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
citizen served on all aspects Public
 
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
um any questions I'm happy to answer as
 
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.220 align:start position:0%

00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:32.579 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
being here and taking my question
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
um so as I read this bill it
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
says that you want to urge
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
public and private businesses to embrace
 
00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:48.829 align:start position:0%
public and private businesses to embrace
diversity

00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
um and embrace this welcoming
 
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
um can you give an example of
 
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
how you believe the state
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire should
 
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
urge businesses public and private to do
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
this what is your what are your examples
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
I can tell you in Nashua greater Nashua
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
Area Chamber to chamber and I've built
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
sister city between India one of the
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
cities that I came from to where I live
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
and chamber did uh facts or in terms of
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
how the economic impact of the region so
 
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:32.220 align:start position:0%
just if I yeah in Greater Nashua area we
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
have about six percent Indian American
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
alone people who look come from where I
 
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
come from they contribute they have over
 
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.410 align:start position:0%
come from they contribute they have over
100

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:41.420 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
businesses started by them starting from
 
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
grocery store uh Salon to high tech and
 
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:53.180 align:start position:0%
working and they bring in this was
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
2015-16 time that time frame they bring
 
00:39:59.650 --> 00:39:59.660 align:start position:0%
in about
 
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
3.5 billion dollars Revenue each year
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
just the 100 business just this
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
community so when there is a positive
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
impact just acknowledging the presence
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
and that's why Nashua has gone that way
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
to officially become welcoming and we
 
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:22.220 align:start position:0%
have a welcoming celebrity
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
and when uh you know somebody from India
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so they will you know it's not a
 
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.010 align:start position:0%
yeah so they will you know it's not a
mandatory

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:33.020 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
policy changes
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know instead of saying go back to
 
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:39.740 align:start position:0%
where you come from
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the fact that we are here
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
to stay
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
and we are contributing
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
so encouraging that
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
inclusion and acknowledging contribution
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm trying to
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
get at how this bill would and I know
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying this is not a
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
mandate but the word urge
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
is not defined here and I I'm curious
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
where the government's places in
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
that definition of urging there is it's
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
not a bill it's a resolution so there's
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
no implementation of any law or Bill it
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
is just acknowledging yes we see the
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
diversity yes it's uh happening and yes
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge it that's all
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment of presence of immigrants
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
and we are a welcoming state
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you other question to
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the statistics
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
you used before
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
you said it went from I forget 100 white
 
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
to 96 or down to 86 currently so with
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
the ideal goal be zero percent White
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
no right that's really not a an
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
appropriate question I don't think thank
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
you madam well I'm just curious the
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
trend is moving downwards
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that's a good thing that's what we're
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
establishing no I'm not saying anything
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
about it I'm just stating the facts uh
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative and there is no motive or
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
goal to say we want to shift it it is
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%

come from
 
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.140 align:start position:0%

01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
and down through the notch uh with our
 
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
kids visiting uh New Hampshire and
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
always when we went by always mentioned
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
that geez it's what New Hampshire is
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to be all about
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
and uh I just thought that it would be
 
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
interesting to recognize uh the days
 
01:15:46.729 --> 01:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
that the old man decided to come down
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
nobody saw it
 
01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
nobody heard it
 
01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
and it's just as if
 
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
it was his choice to come down when he
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
wanted to come down
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know if he was there for a
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
hundred years
 
01:16:03.169 --> 01:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
or a thousand years
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
for a million years
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
it was his choice and the higher being
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
that decided that it's time to come down
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
so I had a talk with a representative
 
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.890 align:start position:0%
so I had a talk with a representative
shirtless

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
shirtless
 
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
oh about a year and a half two years ago
 
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
about some type of remembrance not a big
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
whoop-dee-doo holiday just a day of
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
remembrance if you drive through the
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
night she'll look up and say oh
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
that was pretty cool
 
01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
what do you think about it says yeah
 
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
that was very interesting
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.209 align:start position:0%
and uh
just

01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
it was it just
 
01:16:46.570 --> 01:16:46.580 align:start position:0%
was something that I thought was
 
01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:48.169 align:start position:0%
was something that I thought was
appropriate

01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
and then I talked to Senator Bradley
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
about a year ago he said John that's
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's something I could get behind
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
and then I talked to uh
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Packard and he says I
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
could I could co-sponsor that and also
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
talk to Senator Susie and she said yeah
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
I've I've done that myself going up
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
through the notch look up and say geez
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
he's missing
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
so that was my idea uh to have the four
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
leadership positions
 
01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:27.260 align:start position:0%
uh be co-sponsors and they all agree
 
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
I've broached the subject with uh some
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
of the media
 
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
they approached the subject with the
 
01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:36.470 align:start position:0%
they approached the subject with the
governor

01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
and the governor said he would
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
definitely be behind this it's just a
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
day of remembrance it's not a big
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
whoop-de-doo holiday like I said just
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
something that would be on the calendar
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
I also realized that Edna
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
being as I'm a four-term member they do
 
01:17:56.330 --> 01:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
not like to do days
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
so I understand that it's just that this
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
would be a nice thing to do for the
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire because it is
 
01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.229 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire because it is
remembered

01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
remembered
 
01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:12.590 align:start position:0%
the United States
mint

01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
mint
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
remembered the old man on the quarter
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
the United States Postal Service
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
remembered the old man
 
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
way back with a three cent stamp I'm old
 
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
enough to remember that
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
so if the United States thought it was
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
important enough to remember the old man
 
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
I think is important enough for us
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
who live in New Hampshire and have seen
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
the old man
 
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
to remember the old man
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to close
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
with a quote
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
men hang out their signs
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
indicative of their respective traits
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
shoemakers hang out a giant shoe
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
Jewelers a monster watch
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
and the dentist hangs out a gold tubes
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
God almighty
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
has hung out a sign
 
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
to show that their he makes men
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%

go so deep into New Hampshire's
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
culture and history it's something I
 
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
think we're always proud of and I
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
remember as a kid going up to the Notch
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
and looking up
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
to see the old man it's always it was
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
always very exciting so I again I just
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%

it
thank you

01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh Mr Leahy one of
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we have when it comes
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
to days of recognition is that they're
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
just going to be in a statute never to
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
be see never to see the light of day
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
right so does your organization have a
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
plan on what they would do on this day
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question not
 
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily but I will say that and I
 
01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
won't give you the full history of the
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
four Society but you know back in the
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
1920s before Society actually worked
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
with the state to establish Franconia
 
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
Franconia Notch State Park so it's it is
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
part of our history too so I think we
 
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
certainly would want to do things to
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
um you know promote the day and promote
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
the importance of
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
celebrating the old man but so but I
 
01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
don't have a particular plan right now
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
in place we haven't come to that but
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's again it's it is part of our
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you madam chair a quick
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
question in terms of since the old man
 
01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.790 align:start position:0%
question in terms of since the old man
has

01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:11.060 align:start position:0%
disappeared or he disappeared
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
hasn't been there the franconian lodge
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
when you go to see the notch there's
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
some histories there's some description
 
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
and historical perspective of the space
 
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
it already exists right yeah so there is
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
a old man Plaza in the notch
 
01:22:32.169 --> 01:22:32.179 align:start position:0%
um which is very it's a beautiful spot
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
we just think this day would kind of add
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
to what we're what the state is doing to
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
celebrate the old man thank you follow
 
01:22:42.649 --> 01:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
up yeah thank you madam chair so is
 
01:22:45.649 --> 01:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
there anything up on the notch to kind
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
of commemorate this is what it was to
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
encourage tourism to go all the way up
 
01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
you mean in the like a place I mean like
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
where there used to be I don't believe
 
01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.229 align:start position:0%
 
Simon

01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
Simon
 
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
if I can just help with that um there's
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
a place called profile point right
 
01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
around profile Lake and there are
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
depending on your height you can stand
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
at certain points and they've set stuff
 
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
up so that you can see the old man as it
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
would have been on the mountain so you
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
can kind of experience what it was like
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
noticed I know that out at Mount
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
Rushmore a lot of the the stones have
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
come loose and some of them fall down
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
and they've uh the federal government
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
has worked to to wire them back up and
 
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
to hold everything in place you know if
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
there's been any any uh suggestions or
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
work to perhaps re uh reconstruct the
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
old man and wire him back up
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
I I don't
 
01:23:58.689 --> 01:23:58.699 align:start position:0%
I know it when it first happened
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
I do know that the the old man was wired
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
together for years at least prior to its
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
failure yeah so I I believe there's
 
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
I can wait yeah thank you
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you sir thank you David
 
01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:25.550 align:start position:0%
all right thank you sir thank you David
Nielsen

01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
good morning Representatives David
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
Nielsen I am the caretaker of the Old
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
Man of the Mountain
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
um my father was the first caretaker of
 
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
the Old Man of the Mountain Niels
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
Nielsen and uh my dad myself along with
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
my wife Deb
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
here for the old man from 1960 to when
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
he fell in 2003.
 
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
we undertook many many occasions to
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
secure the forehead Stone and secure the
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
mountain from slipping away and trying
 
01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
to deter the natural effects of acid
 
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
rain to the Rock and things like that we
 
01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
always knew that it would fall
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
we were just hoping that it wouldn't
 
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
fall in our lifetime
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
and the summer of 2002
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
Deb and I were successful at placing my
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
dad's ashes in the old man's left eye
 
01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:32.030 align:start position:0%
dad's ashes in the old man's left eye
and

01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
it was his wish
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
to remain with the old man and in fact
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
he does today
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
The Old Man of the Mountain was
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for tens of millions of
 
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
dollars of Tourism and economic value to
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
going back at least to 1805 and perhaps
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
even to 1604.
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
The Old Man of the Mountain is on signs
 
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
we have the old man of the mountains on
 
01:25:58.010 --> 01:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
t-shirts The Old Man of the Mountain is
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
still a very vibrant
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
part of the economy of the State of New
 
01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.530 align:start position:0%
part of the economy of the State of New
Hampshire

01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
it's not the memory of the old man is
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
not only important to my family but is
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
important to the history of the state of
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
I wholeheartedly encourage you to
 
01:26:14.219 --> 01:26:15.169 align:start position:0%
I wholeheartedly encourage you to
embrace

01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
embrace
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
on this this bill and there are several
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
efforts afoot to do something special on
 
01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:26.699 align:start position:0%
May 3rd and I think this would be a
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
A fitting tribute if there's any
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be glad to answer them
 
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative shuitt
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
um good morning good morning I believe
 
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
that you served on an official
 
01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:45.590 align:start position:0%
that you served on an official
Commission

01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
to look at possibilities shortly after
 
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
the old man fell that's correct can you
 
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
tell us what they I know they considered
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
things such as reconstruction can you
 
01:26:59.930 --> 01:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
fill the committee in on on what the
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
determinations were it actually
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
literally started the day the old man
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
fell on Governor Benson myself and Dick
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
Hamilton were in a helicopter and after
 
01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:11.540 align:start position:0%
we viewed away the old man no longer was
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
governor Benson turned to me and said so
 
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
now what do we do
 
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh we created a commission that studied
 
01:27:22.129 --> 01:27:22.139 align:start position:0%
viabilities of replacing the old man on
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
the mountain creating a new old man at
 
01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:26.210 align:start position:0%
the bottom and
 
01:27:26.210 --> 01:27:27.649 align:start position:0%
the bottom and
[Music]

01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
what eventually became known as profile
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
plaza where you can go and and
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
memorialize the old man
 
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
there are several things there you can
 
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
look at one of the profilers and you can
 
01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
see the old man on the mountain again
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
there's some there's one of the original
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
turnbuckles that was on top of the
 
01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.430 align:start position:0%
turnbuckles that was on top of the
mountain

01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
mountain
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
and eventually
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
what it came down to is or my family we
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
believe the Old Man was created
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
naturally survived naturally and died
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
naturally and should be left that way
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
however we left it up to the general
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
public of the State of New Hampshire we
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
advertised what was your opinion what do
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
you think we should do to memorialize
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
the old man
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
and in fact someone did in fact say
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
let's rebuild the old man
 
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
and in two thousand four dollars the
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
estimate to do that was three million
 
01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:22.129 align:start position:0%
estimate to do that was three million
dollars

01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:22.139 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
I can probably add a zero to that in
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
today's dollars
 
01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
being as Frugal as the state of New
 
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is there will be no way that
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
they would spend three Thirty million
 
01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
dollars to rebuild the old man
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
um I think that the what we did was a
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
very tasteful
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
um and adequate
 
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
remembrance of the old man it's a great
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
place to go Deb and I go there every
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
year on the University of the fall of
 
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
the old man
 
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh pair respects
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
and I encourage you to do the same
 
01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.330 align:start position:0%
and I encourage you to do the same
um

01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien and then Simon
 
01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam uh chair uh just a
 
01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
brief comment and that is you know I
 
01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
come from Nashua I took my kids up there
 
01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
when we used to go camping up north and
 
01:29:18.290 --> 01:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
going through the Notch and always
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
stopped to visit with the old man I
 
01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
would like at this time to officially
 
01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and your family for keeping
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
such a historical thing that represented
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
our state it's on our license plates and
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
everything else like that so uh Kudos
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
too bad nature took over it does happen
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the uh being the
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
Watchman of the old men thank you you're
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
very welcome sir thank you okay
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:46.010 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
chair

01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
um coming from Littleton obviously
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
um that's up in my neck of the woods and
 
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
I know for myself and a lot of people
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
turning the corner on profile Lake and
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
seeing the old man was coming home you
 
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
know it was just there was something
 
01:29:59.810 --> 01:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
different about it so
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate that as well and from
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
that perspective I want to thank you for
 
01:30:04.729 --> 01:30:04.739 align:start position:0%
all the time that you've spent
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
um taking care of of that Monument
 
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
um growing up always wondered here you
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
are so I can ask you how often did you
 
01:30:12.649 --> 01:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
go up there
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
we would usually go up
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
um in the spring and after the snow had
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
gone and see how he wintered and prior
 
01:30:23.570 --> 01:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
to 1980 we hiked up and down the old man
 
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
the mountain and that would take us
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
seven or eight days to complete the that
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
Year's work whatever that was starting
 
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
in 1980 we used a helicopter service jbi
 
01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
helicopters the first few years the time
 
01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
was donated to the state of New
 
01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.470 align:start position:0%
was donated to the state of New
Hampshire

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
that allowed us to go to shrink that to
 
01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
two or three days a year
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
you usually went in July in July toward
 
01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
the end of July the weather is better
 
01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:51.550 align:start position:0%
the end of July the weather is better
then

01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
whatever work we had to do for the year
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
we I gave him a shave and a haircut and
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
we weighed them and measured him every
 
01:30:59.639 --> 01:31:00.470 align:start position:0%
we weighed them and measured him every
year

01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
things like that and then frequently in
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
the fall during foliage season debit I
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
would take a hike to the old man just to
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
put him to bed for the winter
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome back
 
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan
 
01:31:16.729 --> 01:31:16.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I guess I agree
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
with you that 30 million dollars is a
 
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.129 align:start position:0%
with you that 30 million dollars is a
pretty

01:31:19.129 --> 01:31:19.139 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
pretty severe price tag and that I would
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
not be supportive of that if they were
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
tax dollars but
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
I would be optimistic
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
that given
 
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
the nature of the tourist attraction and
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
the sentimental value of New Hampshire
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
that that we couldn't Cobble together or
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
somebody couldn't Cobble together
 
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh private donations that would could
 
01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
equal that amount uh so I guess I I
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be so quick to say that it's
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
not it's not viable and we shouldn't do
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
it but I I think it's I think it's uh
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
something that ought to be kept on the
 
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
table in terms of reconstruction I think
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
I could speak to that one of the ideas
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
that they had the Legacy fund had
 
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
um to memorialize the old man was to
 
01:32:10.729 --> 01:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
actually create a series of monoliths
 
01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
along the pathway down to the lake and
 
01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
when you stood in a particular place
 
01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
looking along on the line of monoliths
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to see the old man proper
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
size and shape some of these rocks were
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
in the vicinity 200 tons
 
01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
they were actually coordinating in Berry
 
01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
Vermont and they were would have been
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
taken from Barry Vermont to the state of
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and placed in this
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
particular pattern that was the idea the
 
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
approximate cost of that job was two and
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
a half million dollars
 
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
the Legacy fund could not raise enough
 
01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:50.090 align:start position:0%
the Legacy fund could not raise enough
money

01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
to get enough interest in that to raise
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
more money
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
so that's where they went about selling
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
the paver stones and
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
um were able to raise enough money to
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
complete the profile Plaza
 
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
along the way we had a disagreement
 
01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
about how funds should be raised and I
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
stepped away from the Legacy fund and I
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to do with them now
 
01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:16.139 align:start position:0%
I don't know what plans they have on the
 
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
table now but I do know that they have
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
some plans for May 3rd this year to
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
memorialize the 20th anniversary when
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
they were talking about
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
rebuilding an old man on the mountain
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
they spoke to the artist and the Name
 
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
Escapes me that created the Tree of Life
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
at Disney in Florida
 
01:33:42.169 --> 01:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
he professed that he had the technology
 
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
to then at that time recreate the old
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
man and put him back on the mountain by
 
01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
drilling into the Rock and creating a
 
01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:51.980 align:start position:0%
fiberglass type
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
picture and we would not be able to tell
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
the difference from his idea and what
 
01:34:00.169 --> 01:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
the old man really was
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
he had no idea who I was I raised my
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
hand and just answered question session
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I asked him who are you going to get
 
01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
to drill the holes in the rock
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
he said well I was really thinking that
 
01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
the people that took care of the old man
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
would drill the holes in a rock
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
he said I'm here to tell you I'm not
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
and that was the end of it
 
01:34:20.699 --> 01:34:22.669 align:start position:0%
and that was the end of it
so

01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
I can't say that it would never happen
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Professor man triputi
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question or a comment and I do
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
remember taking my kids there sure and
 
01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh doing you know it was a very special
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
visit to be at the mountain uh but my
 
01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
question is I mean I see the sentiment
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of historic uh peace to it
 
01:34:58.490 --> 01:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
it was part of New Hampshire history
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
and he guarded New Hampshire folks
 
01:35:02.219 --> 01:35:04.370 align:start position:0%
and he guarded New Hampshire folks
spiritually

01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
spiritually
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
is there any effort or has that historic
 
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
peace being included in the New
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history curriculum
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
since you know my kids learned in school
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
that there's a family that curates and
 
01:35:23.209 --> 01:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
watches over and you know they would do
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
the field trip in fourth grade when they
 
01:35:26.689 --> 01:35:26.699 align:start position:0%
did the local
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
has there been updated with the
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar that there is any
 
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
updated curriculum to that I do know
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
that years ago children in fourth grade
 
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
studied New Hampshire history and they
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
and I lectured approximately 50
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
different elementary schools every year
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
about the old man in the history of the
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
old man and things like that
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not I haven't done an
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
elementary school in a number of years I
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
still lecture to General Civic groups
 
01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:57.530 align:start position:0%
still lecture to General Civic groups
but

01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:58.250 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
that they still study New Hampshire
 
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
history and that the old man would be
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
part of it yes
 
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
you were part just a comment that you
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
were part of you came to Bicentennial
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
School and my kids studied and they were
 
01:36:14.410 --> 01:36:14.420 align:start position:0%
very excited thank you yeah thank you
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair first a question
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the chair I'm here as a substitute
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
for the executive session does that
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
um entitle me to participate in um in
 
01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
the hearing rather than the executive
 
01:36:32.699 --> 01:36:34.010 align:start position:0%
the hearing rather than the executive
session

01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
the executive session will follow the
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
hearing if you have a question that you
 
01:36:41.689 --> 01:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
think will Enlighten the rest of the
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee or Enlighten yourself please
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
um you you spoke quite eloquently about
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
the natural formation of
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the man in the mountain and then your
 
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
work and our former sergeant-at-arms
 
01:37:05.689 --> 01:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
work to
 
01:37:05.699 --> 01:37:06.370 align:start position:0%
work to
um

01:37:06.370 --> 01:37:06.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh to maintain the natural structure
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
I'm a little
 
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
befuddled about why
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
when we think of ourselves as the
 
01:37:23.410 --> 01:37:23.420 align:start position:0%
granite state
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
we would even consider
 
01:37:29.050 --> 01:37:29.060 align:start position:0%
um creating
 
01:37:31.729 --> 01:37:31.739 align:start position:0%
man-made replica
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
thinking that somehow that would be the
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
equivalent of
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
the granite formation that was there do
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
you have any comment on that I would um
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
I would agree you know I don't believe
 
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
that carving something
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
an artist carving something is the same
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
as nature carving that that's why I said
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
our family firmly believed that the Old
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
Man was created naturally
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
survived naturally yes we did some
 
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
things to make him age longer okay we
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
hope gracefully and that he passed away
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know naturally in the middle of the
 
01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
night nobody got to see it I didn't have
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
to watch it on the six o'clock news like
 
01:38:15.649 --> 01:38:15.659 align:start position:0%
the falling of the Twin Towers
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know I'm very happy
 
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
knowing that
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
I do not think that
 
01:38:22.679 --> 01:38:23.990 align:start position:0%
I do not think that
um

01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
creating an artist creating another Old
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
Man of the Mountain would be the same
 
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
there's an excess of 25 different
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
um I was up there a number of times over
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
the years I'm not from New Hampshire
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
originally but I've been here for about
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
40 years I was up there I have such a
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
vivid recollection I don't think that
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
I'm imagining it but was it not possible
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
to uh to go up and and see the the
 
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
formation from relatively close you
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't get out there where it was
 
01:39:11.890 --> 01:39:11.900 align:start position:0%
um but uh but
 
01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
the profile of course was what we're all
 
01:39:19.209 --> 01:39:19.219 align:start position:0%
familiar with but from any other angle
 
01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
and from the location itself it was
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely unremarkable the way the
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
stone stuck out and so forth and so on
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
from any other angle there was nothing
 
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
to see except just rock sticking out and
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
only the profile gave the impression of
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
the Stone Face
 
01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
so I I think I agree with you that any
 
01:39:47.110 --> 01:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
attempt to reconstruct something
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
certainly it could not be made of stone
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh because it would have the same
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
ultimate uh you know end that the old
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
man had and putting something up there
 
01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
um to create the profile would be
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I think uh along the lines of your
 
01:40:11.410 --> 01:40:11.420 align:start position:0%
your thought that was naturally created
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh to inspire us all and it fell even in
 
01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
spite of all the cables and wires that
 
01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
you guys put up there to keep it in
 
01:40:24.010 --> 01:40:24.020 align:start position:0%
place uh and
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
recreating it would not be a possibility
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
right you could when the old man was
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
there actually hike to the old man and
 
01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
go out and sit on top of his head like
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
when when we worked there it was open to
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
the public there were hiking trails to
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
and from it we generally didn't
 
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
encourage people to do that because
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
people by their very nature would
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
vandalize The Old Man and that was part
 
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
of the work that we had to fix every
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
year was you know somebody covering
 
01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
their initials or a heart with initials
 
01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
in it and things like that on the on the
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
old man that we had to repair every year
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
but you could you still can today
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
um if you if you're very very courageous
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
sure do you have a question
 
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
um having known
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
your your pop who was actually a member
 
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
of the House of Representatives
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and you and your wife literally uh
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
risking life and limb to go over the
 
01:41:32.209 --> 01:41:32.219 align:start position:0%
edge to do repair work do you feel if
 
01:41:34.209 --> 01:41:34.219 align:start position:0%
there were a reconstruction
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
that it would be worthwhile for someone
 
01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
to do that kind of dangerous work to
 
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
ensure that it stayed there I'm assuming
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
the stability of a reconstruction would
 
01:41:50.290 --> 01:41:50.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:54.179 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day if you don't mind I mean we
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
can we can chat with these people
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards but uh
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
is there any questions about that's
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
somewhat related to the bill
 
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
 
01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:06.709 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
testimony

01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Robert white and
 
01:42:25.370 --> 01:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
I'm a landscape architect from
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and Intervale and I I believe
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
I may be able to be helpful in a variety
 
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
of these questions but I realize that
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
we're also a little off the topic of
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
your bill today but what I would say is
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
background to myself and why I'm here is
 
01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
for a period of at least six years I was
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
the consultant involved in advising the
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
old man to the mountain Legacy Fund in
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
the development of the memorial Concepts
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
um taking them working with all of the
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee members with a design
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
competition for the memorial and so I
 
01:43:02.169 --> 01:43:02.179 align:start position:0%
had a deep understanding of the of
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
the process that went through and the
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
direction where that was going I think
 
01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say that we went to the
 
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
doors of four different governors
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
and have and and until the Legacy fund
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
decided to lay down the effort to
 
01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
complete the memorial
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh we walked away empty-handed without
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
leadership from the state of New
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to recognize what is probably
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's most important symbol
 
01:43:30.770 --> 01:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
so there's a certain amount of
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
frustration with that we would love to
 
01:43:36.649 --> 01:43:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh have been successful in the private
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
fundraising campaign to do that the uh
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
the profile Plaza that you see out there
 
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
was basically one part of a recognition
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
of a three-part original idea for the
 
01:43:52.129 --> 01:43:52.139 align:start position:0%
memorialization of The Old Man and the
 
01:43:52.139 --> 01:43:53.510 align:start position:0%
memorialization of The Old Man and the
experience

01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
three three parts of experience that
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
were really seen as sort of a an
 
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
archetypal New Hampshire experience
 
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
so but I'm here because there's a uh
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
you're faced with a decision and I would
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here to advocate for it because I
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
think there's really one basic principle
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
that we need from you and that is
 
01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.810 align:start position:0%
that we need from you and that is
recognition

01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
and so I'm gonna uh so while I'm a
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
landscape architect I'm also a trail
 
01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:25.810 align:start position:0%
landscape architect I'm also a trail
Builder

01:44:25.810 --> 01:44:25.820 align:start position:0%
Builder
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
I have spent 12 weeks when I was in
 
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
college in high school in college
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
working on Franconia Ridge the old man
 
01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
is a friend I'm not I'm not as directly
 
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
related to the old man is the nielsens
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
but I do have some skin in the game on
 
01:44:41.699 --> 01:44:43.490 align:start position:0%
but I do have some skin in the game on
this

01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
um but uh so
 
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
um what I want just what I wanted to say
 
01:44:53.209 --> 01:44:53.219 align:start position:0%
in regards to this is that people in our
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
state are anxious
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
for the memory of the old man to be
 
01:44:57.239 --> 01:44:58.310 align:start position:0%
for the memory of the old man to be
acknowledged

01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledged
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
this designation of the um of the Old
 
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
Man of the Mountain day on the day that
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
he fell I use a trail building analogy
 
01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
to it when we used to this when we
 
01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:12.179 align:start position:0%
started building rock steps up Mount
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
Lafayette and across Franconia Ridge and
 
01:45:16.129 --> 01:45:16.139 align:start position:0%
off all the trails in the White
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
Mountains of which I've been involved
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
for almost 50 years
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
what we learned was that you needed to
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
lay before you started steps and you
 
01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
started climbing you had to lay a
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
foundation and that Foundation was a
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
stone at the very bottom of a staircase
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
it could be at the bottom of five steps
 
01:45:36.649 --> 01:45:36.659 align:start position:0%
or 500 steps and that that stone was the
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
foundation upon which everything else
 
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
was possible and so the way I see it is
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
the metaphor for this gesture of the
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
recognition is that's the foundation
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
step to which we will have the
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity with leadership with funding
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
with the the the uh you know the state
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
and local and basically every resident
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
of this state to participate as well as
 
01:46:04.679 --> 01:46:06.129 align:start position:0%
of this state to participate as well as
visitors

01:46:06.129 --> 01:46:06.139 align:start position:0%
visitors
 
01:46:10.129 --> 01:46:10.139 align:start position:0%
to then have a foundation upon which
 
01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
other important recognitions of the Old
 
01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
Man of the Mountain can be rekindled and
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
be brought back to a proper
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
consideration so that we can actually do
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
something about this memorialization the
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
history of memorials in our country is
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
many of them took a very long time one
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
of my college professors was the
 
01:46:34.129 --> 01:46:34.139 align:start position:0%
designer of the FDR Memorial
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
in Washington DC it took 50 years before
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
between the design
 
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
approval of that and the actual
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
execution of that Memorial I would say
 
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's worth the wait the old man is worth
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
the wait also because he certainly was
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
there for hundreds if if not thousands
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
of years so we can wait to get the right
 
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
answer but we need the foundation and
 
01:46:59.450 --> 01:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
this is a very important recognition of
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
that so I would like to close I wish
 
01:47:05.570 --> 01:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
that I had the opportunity to have one
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
of my colleagues with me but in
 
01:47:10.729 --> 01:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
recognition of
 
01:47:14.169 --> 01:47:14.179 align:start position:0%
of in in 2019
 
01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
celebrated the 200th anniversary of the
 
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
Crawford path as the oldest continuously
 
01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
maintained footpath in America over in
 
01:47:28.129 --> 01:47:28.139 align:start position:0%
Crawford notch in night in 1919 to 2019
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
was the 100th anniversary of the
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Mountain Club trail crew of
 
01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
which I had the pleasure to serve on for
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
five years and I'm still involved as an
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
alumni at Camp Dodge as a part of that
 
01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
recognition I commissioned odds Bodkin
 
01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
who was New Hampshire's probably most
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
famous Storyteller to tell a story of
 
01:47:50.689 --> 01:47:50.699 align:start position:0%
what became 200 years of Trail building
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the White Mountains The Old Man of
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
the Mountain features prominently but
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to take about three more
 
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
minutes to play you the very end of this
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
recording so what I'm going to do is I'm
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
going to pull it up on my computer here
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm I've been instructed to point
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
the microphone at the speakers
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll see if this wonderfully
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
low-tech solution
 
01:48:19.689 --> 01:48:19.699 align:start position:0%
to a high-tech uh
 
01:48:42.129 --> 01:48:42.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:53:15.169 --> 01:53:15.179 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:53:15.179 --> 01:53:15.830 align:start position:0%
madam chair
um

01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not not denying anything about the
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
Old Man of the Mountain you certainly a
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
solid part of New Hampshire history
 
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
um but as far as the bill
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh like like many other bills that have
 
01:53:30.290 --> 01:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
come before this committee uh looking to
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh to memorialize in statute
 
01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:35.870 align:start position:0%
uh to memorialize in statute
um

01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:37.729 --> 01:53:37.739 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that
 
01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
that the statute is the proper place uh
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
placement for a memorialization of the
 
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:46.139 align:start position:0%
Old Man of the Mountain
 
01:53:46.139 --> 01:53:46.970 align:start position:0%
Old Man of the Mountain
um

01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
has been we heard today that it's the
 
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
this this year is the 20th anniversary
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
certainly A fitting A fitting time for
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh for any concerned groups or people
 
01:53:59.330 --> 01:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
who want to get together to celebrate
 
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
the Old Man of the Mountain and at that
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
time they could certainly go to the
 
01:54:06.649 --> 01:54:06.659 align:start position:0%
governor and and with with a big uh
 
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
whoop to do uh have the governor
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
proclaim the 20th anniversary something
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
very important
 
01:54:14.159 --> 01:54:14.870 align:start position:0%
very important
um

01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
that is uh certainly up to uh up to up
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
to the individual citizens of the state
 
01:54:22.129 --> 01:54:22.139 align:start position:0%
if they want to do something like that
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and do it but but not to not
 
01:54:27.169 --> 01:54:27.179 align:start position:0%
to put something into uh into statue I
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
think it it just gets lost we've got lot
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
I think there's 28 uh
 
01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:35.219 align:start position:0%
various issues that have memorialized in
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
statute that no one remembers if we want
 
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
to remember the Old Man of the Mountain
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
we should do that with uh within with
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
groups uh getting together to to do such
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
such thing thank you madam chair there's
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
something like us do we should speak to
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
your second I just uh agree with what he
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
said on that
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
any representative shewitt
 
01:54:58.850 --> 01:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
um having served on this committee I
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
believe this is my fifth term uh I
 
01:55:07.370 --> 01:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
generally have hold that ideal that was
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we don't like naming days
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
however in this particular case
 
01:55:20.209 --> 01:55:20.219 align:start position:0%
I feel this is such an iconic part of
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:55:22.139 --> 01:55:22.790 align:start position:0%
our state
um

01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
identity that I am going to oppose itl I
 
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
would hope that we could have it
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
preserved and recognized in statute and
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
I think that would give whoever's still
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
around in 50 or 100 years the impetus to
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
encourage whoever the governor is at
 
01:55:48.050 --> 01:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
that time to continue the recognition
 
01:55:51.770 --> 01:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
for the old man thank you okay anyone
 
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:53.930 align:start position:0%
for the old man thank you okay anyone
else

01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
as much as I respect representative
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
shuitt's position
 
01:56:04.370 --> 01:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
I'm pragmatic
 
01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:09.659 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
I view representation
 
01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
from different aspects
 
01:56:17.090 --> 01:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
and I see the old man on the mountain
 
01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
you know license plates I see the old
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
man mountain in a lot of things
 
01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:25.739 align:start position:0%
I know we have statues
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
in our state for those people that we
 
01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:29.930 align:start position:0%
in our state for those people that we
commemorate

01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
commemorate
 
01:56:32.689 --> 01:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
and I think that those are more valuable
 
01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:40.609 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:56:40.609 --> 01:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
we were as passionate about
 
01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:47.450 align:start position:0%
we were as passionate about
the

01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
representation of other elements of our
 
01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
state as we are as a state towards the
 
01:56:54.729 --> 01:56:54.739 align:start position:0%
Old Man of the Mountain
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
so I will be supporting the itl motion
 
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just looking at it from that
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
point of view on this that I think that
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
when we think about what New Hampshire
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
is known for our beautiful beaches the
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh the foliage in the fall
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
ski resorts that we make use of in the
 
01:57:26.159 --> 01:57:27.229 align:start position:0%
ski resorts that we make use of in the
wintertime

01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
wintertime
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
the Capitol building that we're sitting
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
in now the the drive up the highway the
 
01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:33.290 align:start position:0%
in now the the drive up the highway the
gold

01:57:33.290 --> 01:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
gold
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
the gold Dome is Iconic but but none of
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
them none of those things compare with
 
01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire's old man in the
 
01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
mountain it is in my view step waist way
 
01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
above any of those and it would be a
 
01:57:51.649 --> 01:57:51.659 align:start position:0%
shame that we if we hadn't if we don't
 
01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
have a a way to
 
01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
to observe recognition of that in my
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
view work to recreate it but that's not
 
01:58:05.930 --> 01:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
on the table now so I'll be voting
 
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
against the Ito
 
01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:10.850 align:start position:0%
against the Ito
Ley

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
I want to thank the folks for coming
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
today I uh have a place up in Bethlehem
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.490 --> 01:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
I just I've
 
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
taken a position over the years on
 
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
naming days because as representative
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
true said the numbers that are currently
 
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
in statute are somewhere around 26 28.
 
01:58:38.089 --> 01:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
days listed
 
01:58:42.169 --> 01:58:42.179 align:start position:0%
this calls on the governor to Proclaim
 
01:58:44.209 --> 01:58:44.219 align:start position:0%
annually and I don't know of any
 
01:58:44.219 --> 01:58:45.770 align:start position:0%
annually and I don't know of any
governor

01:58:45.770 --> 01:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
yet or haven't heard of a governor yet
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't Proclaim that day
 
01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'm torn because my position we've had
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
some great causes come before this
 
01:59:02.209 --> 01:59:02.219 align:start position:0%
committee that I have said no to and I
 
01:59:03.649 --> 01:59:03.659 align:start position:0%
think it does a disservice to those
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
other organizations that have come
 
01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
before us in doing so
 
01:59:11.450 --> 01:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
to pass this one or to vote for this
 
01:59:13.490 --> 01:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
I mean I could tell you almost the exact
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
spot I was the day this fell when I got
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
the phone call in the morning bright and
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
early in the morning
 
01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:21.410 align:start position:0%
early in the morning
um

01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:23.209 --> 01:59:23.219 align:start position:0%
and it was I get to receive the phone
 
01:59:24.410 --> 01:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
call while I was fishing on Lake
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee that morning
 
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
and I received a phone call from many of
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know the individual Terry path had
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
called me as soon as he heard from State
 
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
Police that had fallen
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
so I could tell you almost exactly where
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
but for the reason stated I mean I think
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's more important to continue the
 
01:59:45.719 --> 01:59:47.450 align:start position:0%
it's more important to continue the
efforts

01:59:47.450 --> 01:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
at the site in doing what you're doing
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
on the anniversaries and reaching out
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
and having the governor do it than just
 
01:59:58.850 --> 01:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
putting it into statute where it is if
 
02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
you asked anybody to name all 26 days
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are in statute right now I don't
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's more important to stay out
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the Forefront out in the focus and
 
02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:12.179 align:start position:0%
continue to do the job that you just did
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
here today bring it all to our attention
 
02:00:16.729 --> 02:00:16.739 align:start position:0%
as to what happened
 
02:00:16.739 --> 02:00:18.830 align:start position:0%
as to what happened
so

02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to let everybody know the
 
02:00:23.089 --> 02:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
reason if I don't support this why I'm
 
02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
not thank you
 
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
um I share with all of us the common
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
revered memory of the old man and I have
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
very high I hold in very high regard the
 
02:00:46.370 --> 02:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this legislation and
 
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
those others who have joined him
 
02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
And yet when I read the bill
 
02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
I see nothing that requires legislative
 
02:01:01.850 --> 02:01:01.860 align:start position:0%
action we are not being asked to create
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
an entity to solve this problem
 
02:01:09.050 --> 02:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
of how we continue to memorialize the
 
02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
old man we are not being asked thank
 
02:01:13.250 --> 02:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
goodness to spend money because of
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
course we wouldn't
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
um we are not being asked to do anything
 
02:01:18.239 --> 02:01:20.930 align:start position:0%
um we are not being asked to do anything
legislatively

02:01:20.930 --> 02:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
02:01:24.890 --> 02:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
all we're being asked to do is to put in
 
02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
an RSA that no one will ever read
 
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
and that to me
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
does a disservice
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
to the incredible importance that the
 
02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
old man holds in this state there is
 
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
indication here that the governor should
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
do something
 
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
but is it appropriate for the
 
02:01:49.609 --> 02:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
legislature to direct the governor to
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
take not a legislative action but an
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
executive action
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
I think that there's much that could and
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
should be done
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
to continue to maintain the importance
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the Old Man and the mountain in this
 
02:02:09.010 --> 02:02:09.020 align:start position:0%
in this state I think this legislation
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
diminishes that
 
02:02:15.709 --> 02:02:15.719 align:start position:0%
um by burying
 
02:02:20.050 --> 02:02:20.060 align:start position:0%
this language in the rsas rather than
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
encouraging making sure that the
 
02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
governor does what is clearly in his
 
02:02:29.089 --> 02:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
power to do and continuing to support in
 
02:02:33.169 --> 02:02:33.179 align:start position:0%
in public the actions of those who care
 
02:02:34.990 --> 02:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
so much about
 
02:02:37.970 --> 02:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
maintaining its memories so
 
02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:39.649 align:start position:0%
maintaining its memories so
um

02:02:39.649 --> 02:02:39.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
with unbelievable respect for the
 
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
sponsors and for the Fallen structure I
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I would like
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
to thank the members of the committee
 
02:02:57.290 --> 02:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
for their comments
 
02:02:57.300 --> 02:02:58.189 align:start position:0%
for their comments
um

02:02:58.189 --> 02:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
people have spoken very eloquently and
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
very passionately about that and as a
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
member of the North Country I appreciate
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
that representative Smith could not have
 
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
spoken more eloquently and although we
 
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes find ourselves on opposite
 
02:03:11.570 --> 02:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
ends of of a debate we're in agreement
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
on this one the old man on the mountain
 
02:03:15.229 --> 02:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
is different for people of the North
 
02:03:17.209 --> 02:03:17.219 align:start position:0%
country than I think it is for other
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
people in this state for us it's home
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
for us it was a symbol of kind of our
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
Northern rugged Independence and we had
 
02:03:30.050 --> 02:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
a great affinity for it as a part of our
 
02:03:32.089 --> 02:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
community and I remember coming into my
 
02:03:33.649 --> 02:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
place of business the day after that it
 
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
had fallen and it was a day just spent
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
with people coming in and out sharing
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
memories talking about it
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
and so there is I have no lack of of
 
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
love for the old man on the mountain
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
quite the opposite
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
um as a member of the North country
 
02:03:55.609 --> 02:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
um but I agree the bill as well
 
02:03:58.070 --> 02:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
intentioned as it is uh does do a
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
disservice uh to to the to the monument
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
um if it did have a fiscal note saying
 
02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:06.179 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend money and do
 
02:04:08.810 --> 02:04:08.820 align:start position:0%
something as typefisted as we can be
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes I would actually support that
 
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
um if it was going to bring something to
 
02:04:15.649 --> 02:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
the people of the North Country
 
02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
um I would support that
 
02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:18.709 align:start position:0%
um I would support that
um

02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
but this will just get buried and and
 
02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
piggybacking on representative goalie's
 
02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:23.870 align:start position:0%
piggybacking on representative goalie's
comments

02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
comments
 
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
um being able to you know to say 26 of
 
02:04:27.770 --> 02:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
them is nearly impossible I would say
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
almost nobody can mention one of them
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
and get it correct
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
um so I just don't think this is the
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
proper Avenue although I do appreciate
 
02:04:38.089 --> 02:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
and would continue to support efforts to
 
02:04:38.099 --> 02:04:38.930 align:start position:0%
and would continue to support efforts to
push

02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
push
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
actual celebration actual
 
02:04:44.689 --> 02:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
memorialization of the old man so thank
 
02:04:48.589 --> 02:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
just a couple of uh things in terms of
 
02:04:59.810 --> 02:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
yes he's a old man is an icon is a
 
02:05:03.490 --> 02:05:03.500 align:start position:0%
historic uh symbol for our state
 
02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
and this only does the day of
 
02:05:13.250 --> 02:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh the old man disappearing
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
um you know and it's important to we
 
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't know the beginning so we only know
 
02:05:23.450 --> 02:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
the ending and so with that I would like
 
02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
to say there's nothing to say how do we
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
keep the memory alive the history alive
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
to incorporate into the curriculum in
 
02:05:35.330 --> 02:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
our kids the future generation that
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
never saw
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
the old man actually existing but knows
 
02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
that it existed to have those kind of
 
02:05:48.010 --> 02:05:48.020 align:start position:0%
thing is more meaningful than just um
 
02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the end of a icon
 
02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:54.410 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the end of a icon
so

02:05:54.410 --> 02:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
but it's a good path I do respect that
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:06:03.050 --> 02:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
I will see how it goes and
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
02:06:06.239 --> 02:06:08.870 align:start position:0%
and thank you
anyone

02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%

oplc will be presenting an overview of
 
03:31:14.510 --> 03:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
they're at their intentions on
 
03:31:17.389 --> 03:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh the license deletions and
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
consolidations in House Bill 2 and
 
03:31:22.969 --> 03:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
you're all welcome to stay for it
 
03:31:25.010 --> 03:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh we'll see what it does
 
03:31:27.530 --> 03:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
and meanwhile I'm opening the hearing on
 
03:31:30.290 --> 03:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 428 and I call Representative
 
03:31:30.300 --> 03:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
House Bill 428 and I call Representative
Shapiro

03:31:35.750 --> 03:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:37.849 --> 03:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
sorry I forgot about 12 30 speakers
 
03:31:39.889 --> 03:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
03:31:41.229 --> 03:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:58.969 --> 03:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:32:02.210 --> 03:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
colleagues for the record I am Joe
 
03:32:06.769 --> 03:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
Shapiro representing Cheshire 16 Ward 2
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%

03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:12.170 align:start position:0%

03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
so um as you will quickly see there's a
 
03:32:19.010 --> 03:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
a large amendment to this bill but so
 
03:32:20.210 --> 03:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start off with the
 
03:32:23.450 --> 03:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:25.490 --> 03:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
having served on last year's committee
 
03:32:26.990 --> 03:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
to study and make recommendations
 
03:32:29.210 --> 03:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
relative to licensure and Mental Health
 
03:32:32.269 --> 03:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
Professions I'm here to introduce
 
03:32:34.370 --> 03:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
one of the several bills coming out of
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
that committee's work House Bill 428 was
 
03:32:38.510 --> 03:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
requested by and written with the
 
03:32:40.849 --> 03:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
collaboration of the board of mental
 
03:32:44.450 --> 03:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
health and oplc
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill does three things
 
03:32:51.469 --> 03:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
well let me first this bill is about
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses and since um
 
03:32:58.130 --> 03:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
I am a licensed social worker and never
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
heard of conditional licenses maybe I
 
03:33:02.269 --> 03:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
should start off by explaining what a
 
03:33:04.610 --> 03:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
conditional license is
 
03:33:04.620 --> 03:33:05.630 align:start position:0%
conditional license is
um

03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:08.030 --> 03:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
so a conditional license was evidently
 
03:33:12.050 --> 03:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
passed into law in 2021.
 
03:33:12.060 --> 03:33:13.490 align:start position:0%
passed into law in 2021.
um

03:33:13.490 --> 03:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:18.130 --> 03:33:18.140 align:start position:0%
edits RSA 330a and a conditional license
 
03:33:20.929 --> 03:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
for social workers licensed Mental
 
03:33:24.050 --> 03:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
Health Counselors I think for pastoral
 
03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
counselors as well or or marriage and
 
03:33:29.570 --> 03:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
family counselors is a licensed
 
03:33:31.969 --> 03:33:31.979 align:start position:0%
before someone gets their independent
 
03:33:34.630 --> 03:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
clinical license so for an example
 
03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
somebody goes to school and gets a
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
masters in social work
 
03:33:44.210 --> 03:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
um they are unlicensed but they get a
 
03:33:46.670 --> 03:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
job and a Community Mental Health Center
 
03:33:48.769 --> 03:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
so that at the Community Mental Health
 
03:33:51.410 --> 03:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
Center they are providing Services they
 
03:33:53.210 --> 03:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
are under contract a supervision
 
03:33:53.220 --> 03:33:55.190 align:start position:0%
are under contract a supervision
contract

03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
contract
 
03:33:58.490 --> 03:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
um and they are headed for licensure
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
independent licensure in approximately
 
03:34:03.290 --> 03:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
two years but in the meantime they're
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
providing services
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
so this bill that was passed in 2021
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
creates a conditional license for people
 
03:34:15.650 --> 03:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
who are yet to be independently licensed
 
03:34:18.229 --> 03:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
but are already practicing in some
 
03:34:18.239 --> 03:34:19.610 align:start position:0%
but are already practicing in some
capacity

03:34:19.610 --> 03:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
um in the case of a social worker right
 
03:34:24.410 --> 03:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
at a school they'd be
 
03:34:24.420 --> 03:34:25.429 align:start position:0%
at a school they'd be
um

03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
practicing under the auspices of the
 
03:34:29.510 --> 03:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
mental health center probably the
 
03:34:30.790 --> 03:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
medical director
 
03:34:33.050 --> 03:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
but it could also be under this
 
03:34:35.330 --> 03:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
supervision of a a licensed social
 
03:34:35.340 --> 03:34:37.490 align:start position:0%
supervision of a a licensed social
worker

03:34:37.490 --> 03:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
worker
 
03:34:37.500 --> 03:34:40.429 align:start position:0%
worker
so

03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:46.849 --> 03:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
it adds relevant language under the
 
03:34:51.290 --> 03:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
licensed independent Mental Health
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
Counselors and marriage and family
 
03:34:55.370 --> 03:34:55.380 align:start position:0%
therapists so when the when the bill was
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
first passed and then it was written at
 
03:35:00.050 --> 03:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
the statute all of these CL all of these
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses Were Somehow added
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the section
 
03:35:05.809 --> 03:35:05.819 align:start position:0%
um on social work as opposed to the
 
03:35:07.729 --> 03:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
other section so this really just cleans
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
up where the language goes it doesn't
 
03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:11.210 align:start position:0%
up where the language goes it doesn't
change

03:35:11.210 --> 03:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:35:14.090 --> 03:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't change the concept of a
 
03:35:16.130 --> 03:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
conditional license it doesn't really
 
03:35:17.630 --> 03:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
change anything it just puts the
 
03:35:21.290 --> 03:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
it requires oplc to set fees for these
 
03:35:30.769 --> 03:35:30.779 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses and third it makes
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
clear that those conditional licenses
 
03:35:34.729 --> 03:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
are subject to the jurisdiction of the
 
03:35:34.739 --> 03:35:35.630 align:start position:0%
are subject to the jurisdiction of the
board

03:35:35.630 --> 03:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
and you should please note that these
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses have not yet been
 
03:35:42.170 --> 03:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
implemented I think they're still in the
 
03:35:44.030 --> 03:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
process of having rules written so they
 
03:35:46.190 --> 03:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
haven't been implemented but it really
 
03:35:48.349 --> 03:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
is a problem that
 
03:35:48.359 --> 03:35:49.429 align:start position:0%
is a problem that
um

03:35:49.429 --> 03:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
prior to these conditional licenses
 
03:35:53.210 --> 03:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
people would be practicing under
 
03:35:55.250 --> 03:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
somebody else's license
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
and if there was a complaint about them
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
they don't come under the jurisdiction
 
03:36:02.210 --> 03:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
of the board so with conditional
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:13.849 --> 03:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
so you should have before you
 
03:36:13.859 --> 03:36:15.530 align:start position:0%
so you should have before you
um

03:36:15.530 --> 03:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:17.809 --> 03:36:17.819 align:start position:0%
and I don't have one before me but um
 
03:36:20.330 --> 03:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
you should have um before you Amendment
 
03:36:24.110 --> 03:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me sir you said three things
 
03:36:26.090 --> 03:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
yes put the language in the right place
 
03:36:29.210 --> 03:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
it allows them to
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
um create a fee these people on a
 
03:36:34.729 --> 03:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the board and the fee of
 
03:36:36.729 --> 03:36:36.739 align:start position:0%
course how could I forget the fee okay
 
03:36:40.370 --> 03:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
so with the addition of amendment 0916
 
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:36:48.530 --> 03:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
will also will enter New Hampshire into
 
03:36:51.410 --> 03:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
a social work licensure compact a much
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
awaited opportunity requiring adoption
 
03:36:55.809 --> 03:36:55.819 align:start position:0%
by minimum of seven states
 
03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
implementation of the compact will
 
03:37:00.830 --> 03:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
increase access to Mental Health
 
03:37:00.840 --> 03:37:02.330 align:start position:0%
increase access to Mental Health
Services

03:37:02.330 --> 03:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:37:04.010 --> 03:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
promote portability and address
 
03:37:06.530 --> 03:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages by eliminating the
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
need for licenses in multiple States
 
03:37:11.650 --> 03:37:11.660 align:start position:0%
reduce burdensome and duplicative
 
03:37:14.210 --> 03:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
duplicative requirements associated with
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
holding licenses in multiple States
 
03:37:20.030 --> 03:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
maintain consumer protection
 
03:37:22.370 --> 03:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
and support military families who move
 
03:37:24.889 --> 03:37:24.899 align:start position:0%
frequently whether they be patients of a
 
03:37:27.170 --> 03:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
social worker or whether one of the
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
family members be a social work
 
03:37:28.680 --> 03:37:31.070 align:start position:0%
family members be a social work
practitioner

03:37:31.070 --> 03:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
03:37:33.050 --> 03:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
coming from a family of social workers
 
03:37:35.870 --> 03:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
my dad was a social worker my brother is
 
03:37:37.610 --> 03:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
a social worker my daughter is a social
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
worker and I am a social worker it is an
 
03:37:43.250 --> 03:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
honor to bring this bill to you today I
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
think it will be a step forward toward
 
03:37:46.610 --> 03:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
meeting the very significant challenge
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
of responding to the mental health needs
 
03:37:53.330 --> 03:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:56.030 --> 03:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
so that's what I've got
 
03:37:57.530 --> 03:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
um and I'm willing to take questions
 
03:37:59.750 --> 03:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
although I think there are people here
 
03:38:02.929 --> 03:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
who are um
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
will be better able to answer the
 
03:38:09.530 --> 03:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
03:38:14.929 --> 03:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:16.969 --> 03:38:16.979 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:38:20.030 --> 03:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
um so what happens if the compact does
 
03:38:22.729 --> 03:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
not adopted
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.510 --> 03:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
well you said
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
you said that
 
03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
the bill underlying bill is you know it
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
does what it does but that in your
 
03:38:43.010 --> 03:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
remarks about the compact you stressed
 
03:38:45.530 --> 03:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
some of the advantages of it
 
03:38:48.410 --> 03:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
um but what happens if the con if the
 
03:38:50.690 --> 03:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
compact doesn't get adopted
 
03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
obviously with the short it won't do the
 
03:38:55.929 --> 03:38:55.939 align:start position:0%
things it would do but uh
 
03:38:59.750 --> 03:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
does the underlying Bill survive
 
03:39:03.050 --> 03:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
um yes that's up to us this isn't the
 
03:39:04.670 --> 03:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
compact is an addition not a
 
03:39:07.130 --> 03:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
substitution yep can I can I speak to
 
03:39:09.410 --> 03:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
that I I think the chair is absolutely
 
03:39:12.349 --> 03:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
correct if the um amendment is not
 
03:39:14.330 --> 03:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
adopted then the other part of the bill
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
will go forward
 
03:39:18.650 --> 03:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of it um the amendment
 
03:39:21.530 --> 03:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
being adopted and US joining the compact
 
03:39:23.510 --> 03:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the compact will not go into effect
 
03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
until seven states
 
03:39:29.809 --> 03:39:29.819 align:start position:0%
um join I think if we don't join I I
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
assume and someone will be able to say
 
03:39:33.050 --> 03:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
that there'll be an opportunity to join
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
later after it goes into effect the
 
03:39:37.190 --> 03:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
advantage of joining these compacts
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
initially is that when you're an early
 
03:39:43.130 --> 03:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
adopter you get to help in the
 
03:39:45.229 --> 03:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
implementation process including writing
 
03:39:47.630 --> 03:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
various rules and regulations for how
 
03:39:53.050 --> 03:39:53.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
I have one question uh representative
 
03:39:58.969 --> 03:39:58.979 align:start position:0%
Shapiro are you aware that this language
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 428 is actually included
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.370 --> 03:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
um that was suggested to me when I
 
03:40:09.530 --> 03:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
walked in but I was not aware of that oh
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you okay other questions
 
03:40:13.610 --> 03:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien
 
03:40:16.490 --> 03:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh just two
 
03:40:18.410 --> 03:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.490 --> 03:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
the reason the compact is coming is an
 
03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill is that when
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
our committee to study this in the fall
 
03:40:34.010 --> 03:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
on what's Happening the language wasn't
 
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
ready when the time came to put in lsrs
 
03:40:39.650 --> 03:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
the language wasn't ready so this is hot
 
03:40:41.690 --> 03:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
off the press and that's why it's coming
 
03:40:43.790 --> 03:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
in as an amendment would it be fair to
 
03:40:45.650 --> 03:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
say that no states have yet joined the
 
03:40:45.660 --> 03:40:47.150 align:start position:0%
say that no states have yet joined the
compact

03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
compact
 
03:40:49.010 --> 03:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know that for sure but I would
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
assume that that could be correct thank
 
03:40:54.290 --> 03:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
you I would agree represent Broda thank
 
03:40:54.300 --> 03:40:55.250 align:start position:0%
you I would agree represent Broda thank
you

03:40:55.250 --> 03:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
um so representative Shapiro this bill
 
03:41:01.250 --> 03:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
came out of a work committee that you
 
03:41:05.150 --> 03:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
and I were on correct and so the the
 
03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
base Bill your original bill
 
03:41:11.690 --> 03:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
was written what part of the
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
um mental health boards I can't recall
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
exactly I do remember talking about this
 
03:41:19.370 --> 03:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
but I don't recall exactly when this
 
03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
came into play and perhaps that would be
 
03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
useful to the committee on understanding
 
03:41:25.729 --> 03:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
how it is that we got to this bill from
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
the work that was done in that committee
 
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't really think the specifics of
 
03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
this bill got discussed during that
 
03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
03:41:38.520 --> 03:41:39.889 align:start position:0%
committee but
um

03:41:39.889 --> 03:41:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:42.650 --> 03:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
during that committee Dr Goodnow came
 
03:41:45.050 --> 03:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
and an attorney from
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
oplc came and participated and talked
 
03:41:49.490 --> 03:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
about a lot of the issues that we talked
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
about and because we had met there
 
03:41:52.560 --> 03:41:53.210 align:start position:0%
about and because we had met there
um

03:41:53.210 --> 03:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:55.550 --> 03:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
Dr good now who was the chair of the
 
03:41:57.530 --> 03:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
board of board of mental health
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
approached me after that to say we have
 
03:42:02.030 --> 03:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:03.779 align:start position:0%
um we have this language about
 
03:42:06.410 --> 03:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses and it's all all
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
the wording is in the wrong places so
 
03:42:12.469 --> 03:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
this was by virtue of the fact that we
 
03:42:15.170 --> 03:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
met those people at that committee not
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
something that was discussed at that
 
03:42:16.560 --> 03:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
something that was discussed at that
committee

03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:19.070 align:start position:0%
committee
okay

03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:19.080 --> 03:42:22.550 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative so you
 
03:42:29.389 --> 03:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
said the on even though the underlying
 
03:42:31.849 --> 03:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
bill and the provisional licensing has
 
03:42:34.969 --> 03:42:34.979 align:start position:0%
not been implemented it was passed the
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
bill passed last term but not being
 
03:42:42.290 --> 03:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:44.450 --> 03:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
yes and I assume it came through this
 
03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee because it didn't come through
 
03:42:48.050 --> 03:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and elderly
 
03:42:50.330 --> 03:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
Affairs where I served so I assume it
 
03:42:52.210 --> 03:42:52.220 align:start position:0%
came through this committee
 
03:42:55.070 --> 03:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
and I would I would just like to say one
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
other thing just in terms of you know my
 
03:43:00.769 --> 03:43:00.779 align:start position:0%
view of the importance of having
 
03:43:04.250 --> 03:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
um enhanced portability of licenses
 
03:43:04.260 --> 03:43:07.190 align:start position:0%
um enhanced portability of licenses
um

03:43:07.190 --> 03:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
since serving over the last three terms
 
03:43:12.290 --> 03:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
I've been approached by a number of
 
03:43:15.769 --> 03:43:15.779 align:start position:0%
people in my community who were trying
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
to hire mental health practitioners who
 
03:43:20.929 --> 03:43:20.939 align:start position:0%
were having a a difficult time doing so
 
03:43:22.429 --> 03:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
and this was
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
frequently one of their complaints and
 
03:43:25.439 --> 03:43:26.269 align:start position:0%
frequently one of their complaints and
um

03:43:26.269 --> 03:43:26.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:26.279 --> 03:43:27.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:43:27.950 --> 03:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:43:31.610 --> 03:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
just two nights ago I um went to dinner
 
03:43:33.290 --> 03:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
at someone's house which I've almost
 
03:43:35.690 --> 03:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
haven't done in probably three years and
 
03:43:37.370 --> 03:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
I met somebody who had just recently
 
03:43:38.990 --> 03:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
moved to Keene
 
03:43:41.330 --> 03:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
um I so we introduced ourselves they
 
03:43:43.969 --> 03:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
said they were dental hygienists um um I
 
03:43:45.410 --> 03:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
know this doesn't
 
03:43:48.290 --> 03:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
um deal with dental hygienists
 
03:43:50.870 --> 03:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and and and I said oh that's great
 
03:43:52.670 --> 03:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
because we just passed a dental benefit
 
03:43:56.929 --> 03:43:56.939 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid and um
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
and she said that's great but I'm
 
03:44:01.370 --> 03:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
working in Brattleboro she said when I
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
tried to get a license from Nevada where
 
03:44:06.370 --> 03:44:06.380 align:start position:0%
she had moved from
 
03:44:09.410 --> 03:44:09.420 align:start position:0%

Vermont
 
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
um but she didn't go into details and I
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
didn't solicit this information but
 
03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
evidently it's a long-standing complaint
 
03:44:19.670 --> 03:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
that it's difficult to come with a
 
03:44:22.130 --> 03:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
license from another state and be able
 
03:44:25.610 --> 03:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
to get a license handily here and join
 
03:44:32.570 --> 03:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:34.010 --> 03:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:38.090 --> 03:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%

Hampshire chapter
 
03:45:07.010 --> 03:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
we are in support of the underlying Bill
 
03:45:10.490 --> 03:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
and delighted to be here today uh with
 
03:45:12.410 --> 03:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
the amendment of The Social Work compact
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
as representative Shapiro said this is
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
hot off the presses it was
 
03:45:22.309 --> 03:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
finally ready uh February 27th there are
 
03:45:24.590 --> 03:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
a number of states where
 
03:45:27.650 --> 03:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
racing towards the the Finish Line to to
 
03:45:30.349 --> 03:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
be part of the first seven New Hampshire
 
03:45:35.690 --> 03:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
has a long history and of adopting
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts the psychologists
 
03:45:41.330 --> 03:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
have had their compact for years now the
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors had their
 
03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:44.050 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors had their
compact

03:45:44.050 --> 03:45:44.060 align:start position:0%
compact
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
approved last year and we are hoping
 
03:45:50.929 --> 03:45:50.939 align:start position:0%
that we will be able to be uh as social
 
03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
workers included in interstate compacts
 
03:45:53.760 --> 03:45:56.929 align:start position:0%
workers included in interstate compacts
uh

03:45:56.929 --> 03:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
as representative Shapiro said one of
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we're
 
03:46:04.969 --> 03:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
pushing in hard to try and get to be uh
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
front of the line is because some of the
 
03:46:10.670 --> 03:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
major decisions will be made by the
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
states that are initial adopters and
 
03:46:16.250 --> 03:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
actors of the compact we think that we
 
03:46:19.190 --> 03:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
have a lot to offer and and want to be
 
03:46:21.550 --> 03:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
part of that decision-making process
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
within the compact language there are
 
03:46:27.290 --> 03:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
three different licensure tiers New
 
03:46:29.929 --> 03:46:29.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire qualifies for two of them that
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
would be the LSW and the licsw New
 
03:46:36.769 --> 03:46:36.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have an lmsw or
 
03:46:39.950 --> 03:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
licensed masters social worker we have a
 
03:46:42.170 --> 03:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker which is a
 
03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
bachelor's level social worker somebody
 
03:46:46.610 --> 03:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
who has their BSW from an accredited
 
03:46:46.620 --> 03:46:47.650 align:start position:0%
who has their BSW from an accredited
program

03:46:47.650 --> 03:46:47.660 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
that has not been put into action yet
 
03:46:52.370 --> 03:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
but it has been put into statute that
 
03:46:56.030 --> 03:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
there is that licensure tier so our bsws
 
03:46:58.729 --> 03:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
from Plymouth State and from UNH would
 
03:47:01.309 --> 03:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
be eligible for this interstate compact
 
03:47:05.150 --> 03:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh more commonly and uh in greater
 
03:47:08.090 --> 03:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
numbers is the licsw licensed
 
03:47:10.610 --> 03:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
independent clinical social worker
 
03:47:14.690 --> 03:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
there are a little over 1700 licensed
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
independent clinical social workers who
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
are right now active in the state of New
 
03:47:18.239 --> 03:47:19.190 align:start position:0%
are right now active in the state of New
Hampshire

03:47:19.190 --> 03:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:47:22.849 --> 03:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
uh they the all of the finer details of
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
how this will work will come after the
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
rules are written by the commission the
 
03:47:30.410 --> 03:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
interstate compact commission but it is
 
03:47:32.929 --> 03:47:32.939 align:start position:0%
anticipated that somebody who has their
 
03:47:36.170 --> 03:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
licsw in New Hampshire would be able to
 
03:47:38.990 --> 03:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
apply for their interstate compact
 
03:47:42.769 --> 03:47:42.779 align:start position:0%
license it is New Hampshire that would
 
03:47:46.610 --> 03:47:46.620 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not an allies whether
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
somebody qualifies for their licsw and
 
03:47:54.530 --> 03:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
for the interstate compact license
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
any complaints that are made it is
 
03:48:01.429 --> 03:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
or somebody who is licensed originally
 
03:48:04.130 --> 03:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the complaints are
 
03:48:06.590 --> 03:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
handled by New Hampshire
 
03:48:08.990 --> 03:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
even if the complaint does come from one
 
03:48:12.050 --> 03:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
of the member states where the client
 
03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
might be I will also point out that the
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
the interstate compact is based on where
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
a person resides not where they work
 
03:48:26.330 --> 03:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
there are some social workers who live
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but work in
 
03:48:32.030 --> 03:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so they have their their
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
license in Massachusetts for this they
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
would need to have their license
 
03:48:40.010 --> 03:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because it is based on
 
03:48:43.370 --> 03:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.389 --> 03:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
there are so many benefits to the
 
03:48:49.490 --> 03:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
portability that an interstate compact
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
allows especially in New England where
 
03:48:57.530 --> 03:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
in talking with my uh colleagues from
 
03:48:59.870 --> 03:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
the other states and I am my colleague
 
03:49:01.490 --> 03:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
for Vermont I'm also the executive
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
director for the Vermont chapter it is
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
anticipated within the next year or two
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
all of the New England states will be
 
03:49:12.530 --> 03:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
will be able to be a part of this will
 
03:49:15.610 --> 03:49:15.620 align:start position:0%
have it enacted in their states
 
03:49:19.309 --> 03:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh I talk with social workers all the
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
time who have three licenses right they
 
03:49:23.690 --> 03:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
live on the Seacoast they have their
 
03:49:25.070 --> 03:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire they have their
 
03:49:26.450 --> 03:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
license in Maine they have their license
 
03:49:30.530 --> 03:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts it is expensive and one
 
03:49:33.889 --> 03:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
needs to maintain like Okay Main qual
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
requires this for re-licensure New
 
03:49:38.929 --> 03:49:38.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire requires this Massachusetts
 
03:49:42.170 --> 03:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
requires something else with this you
 
03:49:45.170 --> 03:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
would have one set of criteria New
 
03:49:47.389 --> 03:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's criteria if you live in New
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to follow and then that way
 
03:49:54.410 --> 03:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
you are still able to see clients in all
 
03:49:56.750 --> 03:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
the other states that have adopted the
 
03:49:56.760 --> 03:49:58.510 align:start position:0%
the other states that have adopted the
compact

03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
compact
 
03:50:01.969 --> 03:50:01.979 align:start position:0%
this allows for when somebody's client
 
03:50:06.950 --> 03:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
goes on vacation moves away uh the the
 
03:50:09.410 --> 03:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
social worker themselves is out of state
 
03:50:11.389 --> 03:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
as long as they're in a member State
 
03:50:14.030 --> 03:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
they are able to con to continue seeing
 
03:50:18.410 --> 03:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
their client without the fear of uh
 
03:50:20.929 --> 03:50:20.939 align:start position:0%
weighing out is this an emergency would
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
I be able if there's a problem uh do I
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
run the risk of losing my license
 
03:50:31.370 --> 03:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
this eliminates that military families
 
03:50:31.380 --> 03:50:33.110 align:start position:0%
this eliminates that military families
are

03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:50:35.090 --> 03:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
the reason why the Department of Defense
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
issues the grants to write these
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
compacts is because military spouses are
 
03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
some of the most underemployed people in
 
03:50:43.969 --> 03:50:43.979 align:start position:0%
the country because they move from state
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
to state and it takes a while to get a
 
03:50:48.110 --> 03:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
new license
 
03:50:51.290 --> 03:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
so military families would be absolutely
 
03:50:51.300 --> 03:50:52.929 align:start position:0%
so military families would be absolutely
uh

03:50:52.929 --> 03:50:52.939 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:50:55.929 --> 03:50:55.939 align:start position:0%
benefiting for the social workers who
 
03:50:58.490 --> 03:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
are part of military families moving
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:04.969 --> 03:51:04.979 align:start position:0%
and another issue that always comes up
 
03:51:07.070 --> 03:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
for for social workers is when their
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
client is a college student and the
 
03:51:11.450 --> 03:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
class the college student goes out of
 
03:51:14.330 --> 03:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
state and can they continue to see that
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
student and the answer right now is no
 
03:51:19.250 --> 03:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
unless you are licensed in the state
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
where your client is you cannot continue
 
03:51:24.170 --> 03:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
to see them
 
03:51:28.190 --> 03:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
this will eliminate that issue and
 
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
provide continuity of care for our
 
03:51:33.769 --> 03:51:33.779 align:start position:0%
clients so I am happy to answer any
 
03:51:36.610 --> 03:51:36.620 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have director
 
03:51:39.710 --> 03:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
Courtney is also here she might be able
 
03:51:41.570 --> 03:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
to answer some of these questions a
 
03:51:43.610 --> 03:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
little better than I can
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
um but I do hope that you will adopt
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment to House Bill 428. thank
 
03:51:52.429 --> 03:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.090 --> 03:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
Gerhard and then goalie
 
03:51:58.190 --> 03:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair can you give me an
 
03:52:00.170 --> 03:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
exam a concrete example of one of the
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
special privileges we have in changing
 
03:52:03.650 --> 03:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
the rules if we were part of the first
 
03:52:03.660 --> 03:52:04.729 align:start position:0%
the rules if we were part of the first
seven

03:52:04.729 --> 03:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
seven
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
03:52:10.610 --> 03:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of of the compact
 
03:52:13.190 --> 03:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
language is about what the commission
 
03:52:15.170 --> 03:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
will do the commission is going to set
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
up the rules they're going to set up the
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
database they're going to set up
 
03:52:23.469 --> 03:52:23.479 align:start position:0%
everything uh in order to make it work
 
03:52:28.910 --> 03:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
and so it is every member state gets a
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative on the commission but
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's those it's those first adopters
 
03:52:38.510 --> 03:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
that will be at the table when a lot of
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I just first
 
03:52:51.889 --> 03:52:51.899 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up on that question because
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
as more States come in cannot those
 
03:52:57.290 --> 03:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations be changed as the
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
states come forward and want to change
 
03:53:01.729 --> 03:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
the initial rules and the setup if they
 
03:53:04.750 --> 03:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:08.210 --> 03:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
yes but once the once the database is
 
03:53:10.910 --> 03:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
selected in the the criteria is selected
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
03:53:14.809 --> 03:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
from my reading of it they'll be meeting
 
03:53:16.190 --> 03:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
once a year
 
03:53:19.550 --> 03:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
so yes rules could change down the road
 
03:53:22.010 --> 03:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
but my
 
03:53:24.050 --> 03:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
03:53:27.050 --> 03:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
guess is that they would not be it would
 
03:53:28.729 --> 03:53:28.739 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
03:53:31.490 --> 03:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
a collaborative decision because oh
 
03:53:32.570 --> 03:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
there's something that we didn't take
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
into consideration and we need to change
 
03:53:35.040 --> 03:53:36.530 align:start position:0%
into consideration and we need to change
oh

03:53:36.530 --> 03:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:53:38.750 --> 03:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
so the initial setup of the rules would
 
03:53:41.330 --> 03:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
probably be mostly standardized going
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
forward not something that
 
03:53:44.929 --> 03:53:44.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would be looking
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
specifically for but it would be what
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
all states initially involved
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
are looking to set forward
 
03:53:56.990 --> 03:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
it it could be I'm gonna defer to
 
03:54:00.170 --> 03:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
director Courtney as she was part of the
 
03:54:06.950 --> 03:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.670 --> 03:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
so if we start allowing states to pick
 
03:54:13.610 --> 03:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
where people want to set up their shop
 
03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:22.490 --> 03:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
could that allow someone to
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
operate out of a state that has
 
03:54:28.729 --> 03:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
a lower licensing fee
 
03:54:32.929 --> 03:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
than where they currently are situated
 
03:54:37.010 --> 03:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
and also maybe Target a state where
 
03:54:40.370 --> 03:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
rates are a little higher and
 
03:54:47.570 --> 03:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.710 --> 03:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
yes but they'd have to move there so
 
03:54:56.210 --> 03:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
um if right now we already have
 
03:54:59.630 --> 03:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
a multitude of licensed social workers
 
03:55:03.710 --> 03:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
who are working in Massachusetts because
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
the rates are higher and Massachusetts
 
03:55:09.670 --> 03:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
is really close by
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's a personal decision that
 
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
everybody needs to make I'm not sure how
 
03:55:19.070 --> 03:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
much State shopping there would be for
 
03:55:23.809 --> 03:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
who where you can get a license
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
easier or less expensively the
 
03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.150 --> 03:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
at their at their roots are very
 
03:55:41.210 --> 03:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
standardized accredited MSW program two
 
03:55:44.330 --> 03:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
years clinical supervision exam and the
 
03:55:46.150 --> 03:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
aswb exam
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's true across the board some states
 
03:55:52.670 --> 03:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
have different oh you need to take this
 
03:55:56.090 --> 03:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
course or this jurisprudence exam but at
 
03:56:00.110 --> 03:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
at its core uh the requirements for your
 
03:56:04.130 --> 03:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
licsw are extremely similar
 
03:56:07.070 --> 03:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
03:56:12.110 --> 03:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:13.610 --> 03:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
folks leaving the state for better
 
03:56:16.130 --> 03:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
opportunities or folks
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
who become licensed here
 
03:56:20.030 --> 03:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
taking up clients in other states
 
03:56:21.650 --> 03:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
because it's more profitable than taking
 
03:56:22.849 --> 03:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
up the clients here in New Hampshire
 
03:56:27.530 --> 03:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
if you if you already are a part of this
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
if you have your social work compact
 
03:56:35.929 --> 03:56:35.939 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire and you decide
 
03:56:39.950 --> 03:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
to move to Montana because and Montana
 
03:56:42.290 --> 03:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
is a
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
a member State you then need to get your
 
03:56:52.969 --> 03:56:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:54.590 --> 03:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm just trying to like connect to
 
03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Dots here uh so if that's the choice
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:06.530 --> 03:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
people would be seeing you're you're
 
03:57:08.929 --> 03:57:08.939 align:start position:0%
thinking via Telehealth and picking up a
 
03:57:08.939 --> 03:57:10.849 align:start position:0%
thinking via Telehealth and picking up a
client

03:57:10.849 --> 03:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
client
 
03:57:10.859 --> 03:57:15.170 align:start position:0%
client
s

03:57:15.170 --> 03:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:17.090 --> 03:57:17.100 align:start position:0%
it would depend on where the insurance
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:24.429 --> 03:57:24.439 align:start position:0%
probably not Montana
 
03:57:29.450 --> 03:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
okay other questions representation
 
03:57:31.969 --> 03:57:31.979 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:57:34.370 --> 03:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
so what kind of a shortfall are we
 
03:57:35.929 --> 03:57:35.939 align:start position:0%
looking at in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:57:38.269 --> 03:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
right at the moment in terms of people
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:45.170 --> 03:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
shortfall in terms of number of people
 
03:57:49.250 --> 03:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
who are looking for uh social workers
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
and cannot find them or agencies that
 
03:57:52.670 --> 03:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
are looking for social workers that
 
03:57:54.410 --> 03:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
can't hire them
 
03:57:56.750 --> 03:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
that would be the among the groups that
 
03:58:00.170 --> 03:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
certainly would be interested in uh
 
03:58:02.570 --> 03:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
having more people available to come
 
03:58:05.150 --> 03:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
with the compact permit that
 
03:58:07.010 --> 03:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
yes because you could you could move
 
03:58:08.750 --> 03:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
here and you if you already have your
 
03:58:13.130 --> 03:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
interstate compact license then you're
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
already good to go and would be able to
 
03:58:18.530 --> 03:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
start seeing seeing clients while behind
 
03:58:19.969 --> 03:58:19.979 align:start position:0%
the scenes you're doing the paperwork to
 
03:58:22.150 --> 03:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
update your home state
 
03:58:25.370 --> 03:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh so and that's one of the things that
 
03:58:28.370 --> 03:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
I hear about is from both agencies and
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
from social workers I'd like I I have a
 
03:58:31.199 --> 03:58:32.150 align:start position:0%
from social workers I'd like I I have a
job

03:58:32.150 --> 03:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
job
 
03:58:34.729 --> 03:58:34.739 align:start position:0%
but it's based it's conditional on my
 
03:58:37.790 --> 03:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
having a license and so if there's that
 
03:58:41.330 --> 03:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
delay a month three months six months
 
03:58:43.910 --> 03:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
and getting my license that prevents
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
that social worker from working and that
 
03:58:48.889 --> 03:58:48.899 align:start position:0%
agency from having the personal there
 
03:58:52.610 --> 03:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh but I I'm
 
03:58:54.950 --> 03:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
not getting an answer and I realize you
 
03:58:58.010 --> 03:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
can't give us a specific answer but how
 
03:58:59.809 --> 03:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
much of a shortfall is there in New
 
03:59:02.570 --> 03:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now for social workers
 
03:59:05.150 --> 03:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
and the categories that you've mentioned
 
03:59:09.050 --> 03:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
the license social worker or the
 
03:59:13.130 --> 03:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
and bachelor's level you not sure how
 
03:59:13.140 --> 03:59:14.030 align:start position:0%
and bachelor's level you not sure how
sure

03:59:14.030 --> 03:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:59:15.650 --> 03:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
they have the data for that what I have
 
03:59:18.170 --> 03:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
is anecdotally hearing that Community
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers there's there's
 
03:59:23.689 --> 03:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
months long wait to get into to be able
 
03:59:25.370 --> 03:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
to be seen
 
03:59:28.929 --> 03:59:28.939 align:start position:0%
um and I am hearing from social workers
 
03:59:33.170 --> 03:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
that they have no more
 
03:59:35.630 --> 03:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
if they set up a waiting list and most
 
03:59:37.610 --> 03:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
social workers don't set if they're in
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
private or small group practice they
 
03:59:41.809 --> 03:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
can't even set up a waiting list because
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
the numbers are too great that people
 
03:59:43.800 --> 03:59:45.050 align:start position:0%
the numbers are too great that people
are

03:59:45.050 --> 03:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:59:47.330 --> 03:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
knocking on their doors and there's just
 
03:59:49.610 --> 03:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
no room that certainly is an indicator
 
03:59:51.889 --> 03:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
of that there's a there's definitely a
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage thank you I wish that
 
03:59:56.929 --> 03:59:56.939 align:start position:0%
I had specific numbers and data but I do
 
03:59:56.939 --> 03:59:58.130 align:start position:0%
I had specific numbers and data but I do
not

03:59:58.130 --> 03:59:58.140 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:00:04.370 --> 04:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:06.590 --> 04:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
oh actually no represent Broder you are
 
04:00:08.930 --> 04:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
a sponsor of this bill
 
04:00:08.940 --> 04:00:10.750 align:start position:0%
a sponsor of this bill
[Laughter]

04:00:10.750 --> 04:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:00:13.610 --> 04:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
can't I can't question you may testify
 
04:00:25.150 --> 04:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:28.250 --> 04:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's okay I am too
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
um so go ahead representative thank you
 
04:00:30.239 --> 04:00:31.550 align:start position:0%
um so go ahead representative thank you
so

04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:35.450 --> 04:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that I have when I
 
04:00:38.570 --> 04:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
hear anybody talking about
 
04:00:39.889 --> 04:00:39.899 align:start position:0%
um agreements that are going to
 
04:00:41.809 --> 04:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
regardless of what it is that are going
 
04:00:45.889 --> 04:00:45.899 align:start position:0%
to make Workforce to build Workforce
 
04:00:48.889 --> 04:00:48.899 align:start position:0%
availability increase
 
04:00:55.010 --> 04:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
all over so where these how is this
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to in theory
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
it looks like it would work
 
04:01:09.170 --> 04:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
but in in reality will it
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
and what maybe this is where
 
04:01:15.170 --> 04:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
um this Courtney can be more helpful
 
04:01:17.450 --> 04:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
what examples do we have in New
 
04:01:17.460 --> 04:01:18.830 align:start position:0%
what examples do we have in New
Hampshire

04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:01:23.389 --> 04:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
where compacts have actually done this
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
that last question thank you for the
 
04:01:26.689 --> 04:01:26.699 align:start position:0%
question that last question is
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
definitely for uh
 
04:01:32.090 --> 04:01:32.100 align:start position:0%
for director Courtney
 
04:01:35.710 --> 04:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
I think one of the ways that it affects
 
04:01:40.389 --> 04:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
Workforce and availability of clinicians
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
is if if you have a client
 
04:01:47.809 --> 04:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
who who has moved
 
04:01:50.570 --> 04:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
either to New Hampshire or from New
 
04:01:53.510 --> 04:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if the if the social worker
 
04:01:57.229 --> 04:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
can continue seeing them then that
 
04:01:59.090 --> 04:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
client doesn't need to find another
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
social worker
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
right if uh if the social worker's
 
04:02:06.830 --> 04:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
client is a college student and now
 
04:02:09.290 --> 04:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
they're in Vermont they're going to UVM
 
04:02:11.689 --> 04:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
and the social worker in New Hampshire
 
04:02:15.170 --> 04:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
isn't licensed in Vermont that
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
that college student who's the client
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to find a new social worker
 
04:02:23.330 --> 04:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
they can continue seeing their their
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
provider same with if somebody from
 
04:02:30.950 --> 04:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont goes to UNH now we don't need to
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
find a new clinician in New Hampshire
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
because they can continue seeing their
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
social worker in Vermont so uh
 
04:02:43.630 --> 04:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
so that's just one small way that we're
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
managing the workforce that we do have
 
04:02:49.550 --> 04:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
in a better in a better way and if we
 
04:02:51.650 --> 04:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
04:02:53.929 --> 04:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
if it is less cumbersome for social
 
04:02:57.530 --> 04:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
workers to be licensed in
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
a number of states especially the social
 
04:03:02.689 --> 04:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
workers who are on a border like on the
 
04:03:04.969 --> 04:03:04.979 align:start position:0%
border of Massachusetts Vermont or or
 
04:03:09.290 --> 04:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:12.050 --> 04:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
they are they are better able to do what
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
they need to do and not pay for multiple
 
04:03:19.969 --> 04:03:19.979 align:start position:0%
licenses and so that they can can
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:28.729 --> 04:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
a good question yes representative thank
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
04:03:33.889 --> 04:03:33.899 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Renewal licensing if
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
different state licenses continuing ad
 
04:03:41.570 --> 04:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
and you know those can be different and
 
04:03:44.330 --> 04:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
will the compact eliminate that and have
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
one set of continuing ad so there's one
 
04:03:51.710 --> 04:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
fee one set that you don't have to
 
04:03:54.530 --> 04:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
straddle multiple yes thank you for the
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
question if you are if New Hampshire is
 
04:03:59.450 --> 04:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
your home state you are licensed in New
 
04:04:01.370 --> 04:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you need to follow New
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's rules for relicensure but
 
04:04:07.910 --> 04:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
you you don't need to also follow
 
04:04:10.670 --> 04:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
Maine's and Massachusetts where you
 
04:04:12.349 --> 04:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
previously might have also had to have
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
been licensed or currently are licensed
 
04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie
 
04:04:22.070 --> 04:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just wanna
 
04:04:23.809 --> 04:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
question one more point because we talk
 
04:04:26.809 --> 04:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
about border states and it'd be nice to
 
04:04:28.370 --> 04:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
work across the line state lines and
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
this and that and then
 
04:04:32.450 --> 04:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
I just don't understand why we can't get
 
04:04:34.610 --> 04:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
reciprocity among states we have to join
 
04:04:37.070 --> 04:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
a compact and the reason I'm asking is
 
04:04:38.689 --> 04:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
because when you get into compact
 
04:04:38.699 --> 04:04:40.010 align:start position:0%
because when you get into compact
language

04:04:40.010 --> 04:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:04:41.630 --> 04:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I've brought this up numerous times
 
04:04:43.429 --> 04:04:43.439 align:start position:0%
in other compacts we've had before this
 
04:04:45.050 --> 04:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
committee and this is where I really
 
04:04:46.610 --> 04:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
have troubles
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
is on page 11
 
04:04:52.429 --> 04:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
so everybody can look on line 27
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
where the compact is allowed to hire
 
04:04:54.239 --> 04:04:55.849 align:start position:0%
where the compact is allowed to hire
employees

04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:04:57.889 --> 04:04:57.899 align:start position:0%
electoral Point officers fixed
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
compensation to find duties Grant such
 
04:05:01.849 --> 04:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
individuals appropriate authority to
 
04:05:03.769 --> 04:05:03.779 align:start position:0%
carry out the purpose of the Compact and
 
04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
establish a commission's Personnel
 
04:05:07.389 --> 04:05:07.399 align:start position:0%
policies programs and such and such
 
04:05:10.729 --> 04:05:10.739 align:start position:0%
assess and collect fees
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
and then the important part is
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
accept any and all appropriate gifts
 
04:05:16.910 --> 04:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
donations grants money other sources of
 
04:05:19.490 --> 04:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
revenue equipment supplies and lease
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
purchase retain own hold improve any
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
property real personal mixed or any
 
04:05:27.130 --> 04:05:27.140 align:start position:0%
other I mean this gives a compact
 
04:05:30.050 --> 04:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
exorbitant amount of power and what they
 
04:05:31.010 --> 04:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
can do
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
and there's no check that I know of on
 
04:05:35.689 --> 04:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
how much money they can spend and what
 
04:05:37.130 --> 04:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
the fees could be coming back to the
 
04:05:39.769 --> 04:05:39.779 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
and if you could just expound a little
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
bit about that and when you look at up
 
04:05:45.769 --> 04:05:45.779 align:start position:0%
on line 23 purchase and maintain
 
04:05:48.290 --> 04:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
insurance and bonds
 
04:05:50.450 --> 04:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
04:05:52.250 --> 04:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at what the cost could be to
 
04:05:54.290 --> 04:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
run this compact and I don't understand
 
04:05:57.590 --> 04:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
why bordering states can't work out
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of package where they
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
themselves can do something without
 
04:06:03.290 --> 04:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
getting into something this intrinsical
 
04:06:07.490 --> 04:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm going to
 
04:06:17.090 --> 04:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.330 --> 04:06:19.340 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:06:22.130 --> 04:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
question of the chair since I I don't
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
see the director here at the moment
 
04:06:25.439 --> 04:06:27.530 align:start position:0%
see the director here at the moment
okay

04:06:27.530 --> 04:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
hiding behind doing okay yes yes that
 
04:06:35.389 --> 04:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
happens okay representative thank you
 
04:06:37.849 --> 04:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
madam chair can I you did say that the
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Defense funds these
 
04:06:43.610 --> 04:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
compacts the Department of Defense uh
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
gives the grants to write to pull
 
04:06:50.150 --> 04:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
together the people like a council on
 
04:06:52.849 --> 04:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
state governments as The Association of
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
Social Work boards nasw National
 
04:06:57.410 --> 04:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
Association of Social Workers they get
 
04:06:59.389 --> 04:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
they distribute the grants to pull the
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
people together to write the the
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
language interesting all right thank you
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're we've come to a
 
04:07:08.570 --> 04:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
point where we need to hear from
 
04:07:09.969 --> 04:07:09.979 align:start position:0%
director Courtney
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%

bill but also as the as of the proposed
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I had the um pleasure of
 
04:07:49.490 --> 04:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire on the
 
04:07:52.610 --> 04:07:52.620 align:start position:0%

other states and other stakeholders to
 
04:07:59.090 --> 04:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
draft the language of the compact so I'm
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
able to answer any technical questions
 
04:08:02.750 --> 04:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
that you may have
 
04:08:04.910 --> 04:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to know I know that this has been
 
04:08:07.729 --> 04:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
noted previously but this the the
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
compacts that you see today and you will
 
04:08:13.370 --> 04:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
likely see in the future
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
um have been funded by the Department of
 
04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
Defense and the reason for that is uh
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
DOD has viewed it uh vital to have
 
04:08:23.330 --> 04:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
um increased portability for military
 
04:08:26.150 --> 04:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
spouses something that oplc obviously
 
04:08:28.130 --> 04:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
fully supports and so we urge your
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
support of a compact and and this
 
04:08:32.450 --> 04:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
particular field
 
04:08:36.050 --> 04:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
we are members of other compacts in fact
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
I think with respect to occupational
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
licensing compacts the only two compacts
 
04:08:43.250 --> 04:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
that we are not members of are the APRN
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
Compact and the EMS licensure compact we
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
previously were part of the EMS compact
 
04:08:50.929 --> 04:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
that's not under oplc that's uh
 
04:08:52.670 --> 04:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and I understand
 
04:08:55.250 --> 04:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
the legislature chose to
 
04:08:57.889 --> 04:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
um to get out of that compact the reason
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
why we are not part of the APRN compact
 
04:09:02.450 --> 04:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
is because that compact provides that
 
04:09:05.090 --> 04:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
aprns have to be supervised by a
 
04:09:07.849 --> 04:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
physician and we recognize independent
 
04:09:10.130 --> 04:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
practitioner Authority in this state and
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
therefore choose not to join that
 
04:09:13.969 --> 04:09:13.979 align:start position:0%
compact but with respect to all other
 
04:09:15.650 --> 04:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
available compacts New Hampshire has
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
readily joined and the reason for this
 
04:09:19.729 --> 04:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
is because it promotes greater
 
04:09:22.849 --> 04:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
portability of licensure
 
04:09:22.859 --> 04:09:23.950 align:start position:0%
portability of licensure
um

04:09:23.950 --> 04:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:27.410 --> 04:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
this compact is unique however the
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
language is is very similar in certain
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
respects but there are two points that
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
make this compact unique first it's the
 
04:09:36.650 --> 04:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
first compact since nursing that has
 
04:09:38.990 --> 04:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
adopted the multi-state licensure
 
04:09:40.849 --> 04:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
compact model
 
04:09:43.729 --> 04:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
and what that means is you get your
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
license and your state of domicile
 
04:09:48.769 --> 04:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
and you do not need to seek permission
 
04:09:51.769 --> 04:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
to practice elsewhere and we see this a
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
lot with nursing for example Florida is
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
a compact state if you are if you reside
 
04:09:59.570 --> 04:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
in Florida and you have a Florida
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
compact license you accept a travel
 
04:10:04.490 --> 04:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
assignment to New Hampshire you come up
 
04:10:06.050 --> 04:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
here for a couple of months so you don't
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
change your residence we don't need to
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
hear from you we don't need any
 
04:10:10.750 --> 04:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
additional fees
 
04:10:13.490 --> 04:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
you just go do your job and you go home
 
04:10:15.889 --> 04:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
if you choose to change your Residence
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
at that point we will switch your
 
04:10:20.210 --> 04:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
compact to a nursing to a New Hampshire
 
04:10:22.610 --> 04:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
nursing Compact and I have to say
 
04:10:24.769 --> 04:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
particularly during the pandemic but
 
04:10:26.809 --> 04:10:26.819 align:start position:0%
also subsequent to that with extreme
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages we are relying
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
significantly on Travelers and so the
 
04:10:33.170 --> 04:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
nursing compact in particular has been
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
very vital to the state's ability to
 
04:10:35.040 --> 04:10:36.889 align:start position:0%
very vital to the state's ability to
function

04:10:36.889 --> 04:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
function
 
04:10:38.750 --> 04:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
um so this compact is modeled after that
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:10:43.130 --> 04:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
um you said that this is the first that
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
is modeled that has this feature or is
 
04:10:48.290 --> 04:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
the nursing compact already had that and
 
04:10:50.330 --> 04:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
you're copying it it's the first after
 
04:10:53.809 --> 04:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
nursing ah thank you yeah nursing I
 
04:10:55.610 --> 04:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
think was one of the first if not the
 
04:10:58.010 --> 04:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
first occupational licensing Compact and
 
04:11:00.650 --> 04:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
no other compact after that has has used
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
this model but the document drafting
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
team felt that uh one of the sole
 
04:11:08.090 --> 04:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
purposes was to promote greater
 
04:11:11.090 --> 04:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
portability and um that the multi-state
 
04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
licensure model was the best mechanism
 
04:11:17.330 --> 04:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
um the other reason why this one is
 
04:11:21.650 --> 04:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
unique and it's more of you know I'm a
 
04:11:23.150 --> 04:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
legal nerd
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
um it's where you have to get licenses
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
based on your domicile not based on your
 
04:11:31.490 --> 04:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
residence uh it's a legal
 
04:11:31.500 --> 04:11:32.210 align:start position:0%
residence uh it's a legal
um

04:11:32.210 --> 04:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:34.370 --> 04:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
definition but we've run into issues
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
with people having multiple resonances
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
and not being able to determine where
 
04:11:41.150 --> 04:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
they actually need their license and so
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I myself pushed very strongly for for
 
04:11:47.809 --> 04:11:47.819 align:start position:0%
use of the term domicile and that is why
 
04:11:47.819 --> 04:11:48.469 align:start position:0%
use of the term domicile and that is why
um

04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:50.750 --> 04:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
this compact in particular is unique
 
04:11:53.689 --> 04:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
it's also unique because it has three
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
categories of licensure most compacts do
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
not most compacts focus on one category
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
of licensure and so it made this compact
 
04:12:04.370 --> 04:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
particularly challenging to draft which
 
04:12:06.110 --> 04:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
is why it took so long for the language
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be released because there were a lot
 
04:12:09.650 --> 04:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
of issues that the document drafting
 
04:12:11.689 --> 04:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
team had to work through in order to
 
04:12:13.370 --> 04:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that it was practical
 
04:12:15.650 --> 04:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
I do want to note that I think the most
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
relevant section in terms of determining
 
04:12:19.969 --> 04:12:19.979 align:start position:0%
what the qualifications are is on page
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
five section four that's basically where
 
04:12:25.010 --> 04:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
you're going to find what a social
 
04:12:27.229 --> 04:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
worker has to do in order to obtain a
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
compact license and section B an
 
04:12:33.170 --> 04:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
applicant for a clinical category
 
04:12:35.450 --> 04:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
multi-state license has to fulfill the
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
following requirements pass a competency
 
04:12:39.530 --> 04:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
requirement which in this case we
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate to be the exam that our our
 
04:12:45.530 --> 04:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
licensees already take the aswb exam
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then they have to be eligible for a
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
licensure in New Hampshire they have to
 
04:12:53.570 --> 04:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
complete a master's degree in social
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
work from an accredited program we
 
04:12:58.250 --> 04:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
already require that and then they have
 
04:13:00.530 --> 04:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
to fulfill a practice requirement
 
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
um equal to a minimum of 3 000 hours and
 
04:13:05.929 --> 04:13:05.939 align:start position:0%
we already require that there was a lot
 
04:13:07.969 --> 04:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
of discussion amongst the document
 
04:13:10.010 --> 04:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
drafting team and the technical Advisory
 
04:13:11.570 --> 04:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
Group about the 300 000 hours
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
requirement some states require more
 
04:13:17.229 --> 04:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
hours some states require fewer hours
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
the majority of States I believe require
 
04:13:22.849 --> 04:13:22.859 align:start position:0%
3 000 hours and we settled on 3 000
 
04:13:25.389 --> 04:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
hours as a compromise
 
04:13:27.110 --> 04:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
fortunately New Hampshire already
 
04:13:29.689 --> 04:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
requires 3 000 hours so
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
um so there would be no need to change
 
04:13:35.570 --> 04:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
the way we process licenses in New
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in order to
 
04:13:38.809 --> 04:13:38.819 align:start position:0%
um in order to meet the compact
 
04:13:38.819 --> 04:13:40.729 align:start position:0%
um in order to meet the compact
requirements

04:13:40.729 --> 04:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:13:42.530 --> 04:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
couple of other things I wanted to note
 
04:13:44.750 --> 04:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
before I answer any questions is that
 
04:13:47.330 --> 04:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
the whole the compact is a contract
 
04:13:50.450 --> 04:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
between the states and so each state is
 
04:13:52.490 --> 04:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
required to adopt the specific language
 
04:13:55.969 --> 04:13:55.979 align:start position:0%
in the compact it's a mirror image the
 
04:13:57.889 --> 04:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
state can at any time choose to get out
 
04:13:59.929 --> 04:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
of the Compact and we've seen that New
 
04:14:01.490 --> 04:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has taken that opportunity
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to the EMS Compact and so
 
04:14:06.590 --> 04:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
if the compact is not running smoothly
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
if for whatever reason policy in this
 
04:14:11.210 --> 04:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
and the state changes we feel the need
 
04:14:13.370 --> 04:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
to get out the legislature can certainly
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:14:17.090 --> 04:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
but at this point given the workforce
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
shortages I think it's vital that we do
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
what we can to promote greater
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
portability and I just want to bring up
 
04:14:26.570 --> 04:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
our licensure statistics from covid-19
 
04:14:29.929 --> 04:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
pandemic when we modified our licensure
 
04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
requirements to allow us to issue
 
04:14:34.570 --> 04:14:34.580 align:start position:0%
licenses to individuals in other states
 
04:14:39.110 --> 04:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
we saw a 44 increase in the number of
 
04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
licensed social workers
 
04:14:43.729 --> 04:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
who were licensed in New Hampshire so
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's clearly a need and and this
 
04:14:49.010 --> 04:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
would just be another Avenue for us to
 
04:14:52.490 --> 04:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
provide increased access to mental
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
health services so with that I'm happy
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions could you enter
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Goldie's question about
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
the authorities of the commission yes
 
04:15:04.130 --> 04:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
certainly I think that's pretty standard
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
I mean I share your concerns
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative goalie in practice I've
 
04:15:10.969 --> 04:15:10.979 align:start position:0%
never seen it be problematic
 
04:15:10.979 --> 04:15:11.689 align:start position:0%
never seen it be problematic
um

04:15:11.689 --> 04:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:16.010 --> 04:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
are we charged the same fee for license
 
04:15:18.889 --> 04:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
in nursing that we which for compacts
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
and for non-compacts for single state
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
licenses I can pull up the data in terms
 
04:15:27.110 --> 04:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
of what we pay ncsbn
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's under ten thousand
 
04:15:32.689 --> 04:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
dollars a year which from our
 
04:15:34.670 --> 04:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
perspective is pretty minimal
 
04:15:39.070 --> 04:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
so we've never observed any issues with
 
04:15:41.809 --> 04:15:41.819 align:start position:0%
compact commissions being extremely
 
04:15:44.150 --> 04:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
large and just getting out of control
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
but again I would suggest that that the
 
04:15:49.849 --> 04:15:49.859 align:start position:0%
one way that we can manage that would be
 
04:15:51.530 --> 04:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
to obviously
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:16:01.680 --> 04:16:03.349 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um so

04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:16:05.689 --> 04:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you heard representative
 
04:16:09.729 --> 04:16:09.739 align:start position:0%
goalie's question on relevant to page 11
 
04:16:13.370 --> 04:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
especially lines 13 to the bottom of the
 
04:16:13.380 --> 04:16:15.590 align:start position:0%
especially lines 13 to the bottom of the
page

04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:16:17.689 --> 04:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
those of us who have been on this
 
04:16:19.790 --> 04:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
committee for a while and on the
 
04:16:21.849 --> 04:16:21.859 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as well
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
ordinarily I asked whether we're going
 
04:16:25.729 --> 04:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
to go to subcommittee but I don't see
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
where they have the time to do that but
 
04:16:30.290 --> 04:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt my plan is to
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
retain this and work on it in
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the section we pulled
 
04:16:38.210 --> 04:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
we're recommending to be pulled out of
 
04:16:42.170 --> 04:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
house bill too because that's the
 
04:16:42.180 --> 04:16:43.309 align:start position:0%
house bill too because that's the
um

04:16:43.309 --> 04:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:46.250 --> 04:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
there's a strong overlap okay so that's
 
04:16:48.710 --> 04:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's great news because trying to
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
decide this all in a short time frame
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we have for the rest we wouldn't do
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
that for you well
 
04:16:58.849 --> 04:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
so this language at the bottom of page
 
04:17:01.969 --> 04:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
11 is a language it's very very familiar
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
to those of us who've been on the
 
04:17:06.410 --> 04:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
subcommittee previously and it's caused
 
04:17:08.809 --> 04:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
the problem before because it looks like
 
04:17:11.469 --> 04:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
it opens the door to a lot of
 
04:17:15.469 --> 04:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
acquisition of stuff especially stuff of
 
04:17:19.969 --> 04:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
value and the possibility of abuse or
 
04:17:22.309 --> 04:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
running wild or whatever so can you
 
04:17:25.010 --> 04:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
speak to that particular issue certainly
 
04:17:27.050 --> 04:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
and what one thing I would note is in
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
order for a compact to be valid this
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
language cannot change so the you know
 
04:17:33.889 --> 04:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
the committee could not make any changes
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise we couldn't participate in the
 
04:17:38.030 --> 04:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
compact it's an all or nothing that's
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
how the compact works but with respect
 
04:17:42.889 --> 04:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
to the language I I I completely
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
understand and appreciate the concern
 
04:17:47.570 --> 04:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
because it does appear to be extremely
 
04:17:49.550 --> 04:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
broad that said I do think the
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
commission needs that Authority and I'll
 
04:17:54.229 --> 04:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
give you the example with nursing every
 
04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
compact has to have a database system
 
04:17:59.809 --> 04:17:59.819 align:start position:0%
and nursing we call it nurses and every
 
04:18:02.570 --> 04:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
compact member has access to that and so
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
what happens is all licensed RNs for
 
04:18:08.689 --> 04:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
example are in the nurses database and
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
so we can verify as a licensure board
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
the status of that person's license
 
04:18:15.290 --> 04:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
whether it's a multi-state whether
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
they've had any discipline we can also
 
04:18:20.210 --> 04:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
send we are required under the terms of
 
04:18:22.610 --> 04:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
the compact to notify other states
 
04:18:25.130 --> 04:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
member states that a person has is in
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
the middle of being investigated for
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
significant action we are required to
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
send notifications and we call those
 
04:18:37.189 --> 04:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
speed memos and so for example if if we
 
04:18:39.170 --> 04:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
received a speed memo and we have there
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
have been instances where somebody is
 
04:18:44.689 --> 04:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
working in our state they're here on a
 
04:18:46.370 --> 04:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
compact license that was issued let's
 
04:18:48.370 --> 04:18:48.380 align:start position:0%
say by Florida
 
04:18:51.290 --> 04:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
we can Institute disciplinary
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings against their privilege to
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
practice on our state based on that
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
information so that database and all of
 
04:19:00.410 --> 04:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
that information sharing requires
 
04:19:03.050 --> 04:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
support both from a Personnel standpoint
 
04:19:03.060 --> 04:19:04.550 align:start position:0%
support both from a Personnel standpoint
and

04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:06.950 --> 04:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
um you know just database management it
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
just requires support so unfortunately I
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
think that language is necessary in
 
04:19:13.729 --> 04:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
order to make it happen it does seem
 
04:19:15.769 --> 04:19:15.779 align:start position:0%
really broad but it's it's vital to
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
making sure that that information
 
04:19:19.210 --> 04:19:19.220 align:start position:0%
sharing can work
 
04:19:23.150 --> 04:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so is it not the case that
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
this language in spite of the fact that
 
04:19:27.650 --> 04:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
it sounds pretty scary is it not pretty
 
04:19:30.950 --> 04:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
is it not quite typical and how many of
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
the compacts that we are currently
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
involved in quite a number according to
 
04:19:38.090 --> 04:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
your earlier testimony is this language
 
04:19:41.150 --> 04:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
not in those compacts already
 
04:19:43.550 --> 04:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
I I'd have to compare every statute but
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
I would say this language or something
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
comparable must be in every compact
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
because every compact has to stand up a
 
04:19:52.550 --> 04:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
data system
 
04:19:54.110 --> 04:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't recommend New Hampshire
 
04:19:56.150 --> 04:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
joining compacts if we didn't have the
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
capacity to share information readily
 
04:19:59.689 --> 04:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
available because that could put the
 
04:20:01.370 --> 04:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
public at risk
 
04:20:02.929 --> 04:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:20:02.939 --> 04:20:04.130 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
blackis

04:20:04.130 --> 04:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
blackis
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I understand that reciprocity won't
 
04:20:11.809 --> 04:20:11.819 align:start position:0%
do everything the compact would but uh
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments for the compact we
 
04:20:16.450 --> 04:20:16.460 align:start position:0%
heard was it was taking a very long time
 
04:20:19.010 --> 04:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
to for people to get licensed when they
 
04:20:21.229 --> 04:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire I know there's a
 
04:20:22.910 --> 04:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
prior bill that went through this
 
04:20:26.210 --> 04:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
committee and whatever is in hp2
 
04:20:29.150 --> 04:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
and assuming one or both of those go
 
04:20:31.849 --> 04:20:31.859 align:start position:0%
into law would that solve at least some
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
portion of this issue
 
04:20:36.410 --> 04:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I think certainly
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
um I think it was House Bill 594 if I'm
 
04:20:41.210 --> 04:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
not mistaken I think would greatly
 
04:20:43.729 --> 04:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
assist with portability issues
 
04:20:43.739 --> 04:20:44.389 align:start position:0%
assist with portability issues
um

04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
I think one of the benefits and this is
 
04:20:46.560 --> 04:20:47.689 align:start position:0%
I think one of the benefits and this is
why

04:20:47.689 --> 04:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:20:49.849 --> 04:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
the document team and I have to say
 
04:20:52.010 --> 04:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
myself and the representative from Texas
 
04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
really pushed hard for the multi-state
 
04:20:53.880 --> 04:20:55.550 align:start position:0%
really pushed hard for the multi-state
model

04:20:55.550 --> 04:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
um is we push for the multi-state model
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
so that the practitioner doesn't have to
 
04:21:02.689 --> 04:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
seek out you know 40 something or 50
 
04:21:05.929 --> 04:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
something or 50 licenses if they choose
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
to practice in every jurisdiction so
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
that would just be an additional barrier
 
04:21:13.010 --> 04:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
for the practitioner additionally I
 
04:21:14.750 --> 04:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
would say that I will I would not be
 
04:21:16.250 --> 04:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
surprised if our surrounding states
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
adopt this and so what happens is if we
 
04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
become the only Oasis that's not part of
 
04:21:22.689 --> 04:21:22.699 align:start position:0%
the compact
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
we may we may experience even greater
 
04:21:29.809 --> 04:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
shortfalls of mental health Workforce
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
shortages as a result well
 
04:21:35.330 --> 04:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:21:37.729 --> 04:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
um if let's say this were to pass as
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
well as uh the other bill I mentioned as
 
04:21:42.410 --> 04:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming there's no conflict there
 
04:21:44.210 --> 04:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
and the reciprocity bill would then
 
04:21:44.220 --> 04:21:45.290 align:start position:0%
and the reciprocity bill would then
allow

04:21:45.290 --> 04:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
allow
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh Reciprocity for states that don't at
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
least initially join the compact is that
 
04:21:52.969 --> 04:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
correct yes that's correct
 
04:21:52.979 --> 04:21:55.370 align:start position:0%
correct yes that's correct
representative

04:21:55.370 --> 04:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:58.010 --> 04:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
okay first on gold
 
04:21:59.929 --> 04:21:59.939 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.929 --> 04:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
the worker shortfall is an issue we hear
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
about we hear about it everywhere not
 
04:22:09.889 --> 04:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
just with social workers beyond that
 
04:22:12.889 --> 04:22:12.899 align:start position:0%
we're hearing a great deal about the
 
04:22:15.110 --> 04:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
um struggles the mental health system in
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is having
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
and I I would assume that's happening
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
all across the country
 
04:22:24.110 --> 04:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
are there things in this compact that
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
are going to benefit
 
04:22:30.050 --> 04:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
the efforts we're all making and intend
 
04:22:31.490 --> 04:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
to make and we'll continue to make and
 
04:22:32.689 --> 04:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
we'll push really really really really
 
04:22:34.250 --> 04:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
really really really really really hard
 
04:22:35.809 --> 04:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
to make
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
beyond the the Staffing shortages the
 
04:22:41.450 --> 04:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
problems recruiting workers I'm assuming
 
04:22:42.889 --> 04:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
is something that's going to ebb and
 
04:22:45.050 --> 04:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
flow but are there things that you see
 
04:22:47.469 --> 04:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
in here that are going to help us with
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
fixes to the mental health system
 
04:22:53.809 --> 04:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
no not particularly I think that the New
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is going to have we have to
 
04:22:57.050 --> 04:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
have a plan for Workforce and I think
 
04:22:58.910 --> 04:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
part of that plan is attracting people
 
04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
from other states and it and the
 
04:23:03.290 --> 04:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
attraction can't be that it's it's easy
 
04:23:05.450 --> 04:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
to get licensed here people should want
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
to move to New Hampshire because it's a
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful place to work and live that's
 
04:23:11.090 --> 04:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
why I choose to stay I am a transplant I
 
04:23:13.250 --> 04:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
usually don't admit that
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
um but I think then the next question is
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
if I want to move to New Hampshire if
 
04:23:18.530 --> 04:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about New Hampshire or
 
04:23:21.530 --> 04:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
Vermont you know where can I work and I
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
will say hands down that Vermont can get
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
you issued a license much faster and we
 
04:23:28.849 --> 04:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
lose people for that so I think ease of
 
04:23:31.969 --> 04:23:31.979 align:start position:0%
licensure is a is a necessary
 
04:23:33.769 --> 04:23:33.779 align:start position:0%
um it's something that we need to do for
 
04:23:35.210 --> 04:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
those people that are looking to move
 
04:23:36.769 --> 04:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
here we're not going to solve the
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
workforce issue with
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
um with licensure but I think we can
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
assist in removing those barriers
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
through greater portability that the
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
compact could provide
 
04:23:48.110 --> 04:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you I acknowledge the problems
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
with the workforce my question is do you
 
04:23:54.530 --> 04:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
see things in this compact that are
 
04:23:56.330 --> 04:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
going to help provision of service for
 
04:23:58.729 --> 04:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
clients in New Hampshire I think that
 
04:24:00.290 --> 04:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
the yeah certainly I think it could
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
ensure continuity of care I think what
 
04:24:04.729 --> 04:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
we saw with covid-19 for example is that
 
04:24:07.729 --> 04:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people who
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
um who live in New Hampshire and who for
 
04:24:12.889 --> 04:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
example go to Vermont for services and
 
04:24:14.570 --> 04:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
then when those providers move to a
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
Telehealth platform those Vermont
 
04:24:17.809 --> 04:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
practitioners Need a New Hampshire
 
04:24:20.269 --> 04:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
license or when college students go
 
04:24:23.389 --> 04:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere else then all of a sudden you
 
04:24:25.130 --> 04:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
know the the provider needs to get a New
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license and and some providers
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
are willing to do that but I've had
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
others clients contact me saying I'll
 
04:24:33.650 --> 04:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
pay for the license I don't want to lose
 
04:24:35.330 --> 04:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
my therapist what my therapist doesn't
 
04:24:38.030 --> 04:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
think it's at worth for just one client
 
04:24:40.849 --> 04:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
to go through the licensure process so I
 
04:24:42.769 --> 04:24:42.779 align:start position:0%
think for you know as more States join
 
04:24:44.450 --> 04:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
the Compact and I have no reason to
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
think that they won't
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I I think that it will encourage
 
04:24:53.570 --> 04:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
um continuity of care for those people
 
04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:58.859 --> 04:25:03.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:25:03.070 --> 04:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.570 --> 04:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
compacts in the past
 
04:25:06.889 --> 04:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
can you
 
04:25:06.899 --> 04:25:07.969 align:start position:0%
can you
um

04:25:07.969 --> 04:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:10.130 --> 04:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
give us an estimate
 
04:25:12.110 --> 04:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:25:15.290 --> 04:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
availability increase in Workforce as a
 
04:25:17.330 --> 04:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
result of that compact is it five
 
04:25:19.849 --> 04:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
percent to the ten percent is it
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
measurable is it you know I mean that's
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of doing this right so
 
04:25:26.330 --> 04:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
I would think that that would be one of
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
the metrics that we're monitoring I'd
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
have to say that I don't believe that
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
data is available nursing in particular
 
04:25:34.250 --> 04:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't know
 
04:25:35.630 --> 04:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
um because we don't know who's here
 
04:25:38.090 --> 04:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
working on a compact that is the compact
 
04:25:38.100 --> 04:25:39.649 align:start position:0%
working on a compact that is the compact
model

04:25:39.649 --> 04:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:25:39.659 --> 04:25:40.309 align:start position:0%
model
um

04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:42.590 --> 04:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
for the other compacts I don't think
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
we've had a significant time utilizing
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
those compacts in order to adequately
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
measure that psychology we just recently
 
04:25:50.330 --> 04:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
joined but
 
04:25:52.490 --> 04:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
um actually I think we joined in 2019
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
but it's only recently that they got uh
 
04:25:57.290 --> 04:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
the compact up and running mental health
 
04:25:59.149 --> 04:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
is not up and running yet I don't think
 
04:26:01.849 --> 04:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
speaker OT or Audiology are or if or if
 
04:26:03.290 --> 04:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
they are they haven't
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
um we haven't started to issue compact
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
license under the compact so I don't
 
04:26:11.750 --> 04:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
think that we have that data available
 
04:26:13.969 --> 04:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
with our current challenges with respect
 
04:26:16.250 --> 04:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
to data and also because of the the
 
04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
compacts most of the compacts we have
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
just recently joined
 
04:26:24.649 --> 04:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
represent rolling thank you madam chair
 
04:26:26.269 --> 04:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
so if
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
someone in New Hampshire is part of a
 
04:26:28.199 --> 04:26:29.349 align:start position:0%
someone in New Hampshire is part of a
compact

04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
compact
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
decides they want to go down and do six
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
months in Florida
 
04:26:35.040 --> 04:26:36.410 align:start position:0%
months in Florida
working

04:26:36.410 --> 04:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
working
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
a complaint comes out of Florida on that
 
04:26:39.000 --> 04:26:42.530 align:start position:0%
a complaint comes out of Florida on that
individual

04:26:42.530 --> 04:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
it goes to the home state license or
 
04:26:48.170 --> 04:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
um it would be required to go to both so
 
04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
assuming that the person was still
 
04:26:55.250 --> 04:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
domiciled in New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
Reta is the only state that would retain
 
04:26:59.389 --> 04:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
the authority to completely revoke the
 
04:27:02.330 --> 04:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
license for example other states could
 
04:27:04.250 --> 04:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
revoke that person's privilege to
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
practice in that particular state but
 
04:27:08.210 --> 04:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
let's say Florida's decision to revoke
 
04:27:09.950 --> 04:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
the privilege of to practice couldn't
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
impact the privilege to practice in
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
other compact States but New Hampshire
 
04:27:18.889 --> 04:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
as the compact issuing state would have
 
04:27:21.469 --> 04:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
full authority over that license and we
 
04:27:23.149 --> 04:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
would receive that through that database
 
04:27:25.790 --> 04:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
system and obviously take appropriate
 
04:27:28.610 --> 04:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
action follow-up follow-up
 
04:27:31.010 --> 04:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
so in order to revoke a license from
 
04:27:32.510 --> 04:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
something that was done wrong in another
 
04:27:32.520 --> 04:27:34.010 align:start position:0%
something that was done wrong in another
state

04:27:34.010 --> 04:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
a hearing would have to be held
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay for the cost or the
 
04:27:41.450 --> 04:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up from
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
someone in Florida to come testify or do
 
04:27:46.729 --> 04:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
whatever needs to be done to have a
 
04:27:48.710 --> 04:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
proper hearing
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we typically in those cases
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for us now to have
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
hearings remotely
 
04:27:58.130 --> 04:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and so we typically
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
do offer the ability for individuals to
 
04:28:09.050 --> 04:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.729 --> 04:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is a quick
 
04:28:13.370 --> 04:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
one it should be easy regarding domicile
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
can you just help me out with the
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
difference between that and so is what
 
04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
what is the legal term of where I vote
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
is it where I domicile
 
04:28:26.689 --> 04:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's representative true
 
04:28:31.790 --> 04:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:28:36.110 --> 04:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
um did I hear you say that the wording
 
04:28:37.849 --> 04:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
in this amendment
 
04:28:40.490 --> 04:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
is all to do with the Compact and it's
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
it can't be changed
 
04:28:45.469 --> 04:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
correct because each state has to adopt
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
the same language in order to be it for
 
04:28:49.969 --> 04:28:49.979 align:start position:0%
it to be considered a contract and
 
04:28:49.979 --> 04:28:52.550 align:start position:0%
it to be considered a contract and
enforceable

04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
04:28:55.010 --> 04:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair again
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:58.250 --> 04:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out
 
04:29:02.570 --> 04:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
how how a compact is going to uh solve
 
04:29:05.929 --> 04:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
shortages and different fields so let's
 
04:29:09.649 --> 04:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
say Massachusetts uh has uh their social
 
04:29:11.870 --> 04:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
workers they're all working out straight
 
04:29:14.510 --> 04:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough help and they're
 
04:29:14.520 --> 04:29:15.410 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough help and they're
all

04:29:15.410 --> 04:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
stressed out
 
04:29:19.130 --> 04:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire has a shortage of
 
04:29:21.410 --> 04:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
social workers and they're all working
 
04:29:24.110 --> 04:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
out straight they're all stressed out
 
04:29:27.769 --> 04:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
so how would somebody going from
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:29:30.769 --> 04:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
help anything
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
like working in Massachusetts
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're still
 
04:29:38.410 --> 04:29:38.420 align:start position:0%
don't have enough people
 
04:29:40.490 --> 04:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh there are certainly a
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
I mean we talk about this all the time
 
04:29:46.370 --> 04:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
with um or I talk about it all the time
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
with my colleagues who are in similar
 
04:29:49.729 --> 04:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
positions in other states and even
 
04:29:51.530 --> 04:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
internationally there's just a huge
 
04:29:53.330 --> 04:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage
 
04:29:55.550 --> 04:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
um so like I said earlier licensure is
 
04:29:58.010 --> 04:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
not going to solve the workforce problem
 
04:29:59.929 --> 04:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
um we need to rely on other mechanisms
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
to recruit people to want to live and
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
work here but I think that licensure
 
04:30:07.010 --> 04:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a barrier that makes
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
somebody choose to go let's say to a
 
04:30:11.929 --> 04:30:11.939 align:start position:0%
different state Vermont Maine if they
 
04:30:14.030 --> 04:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
are seeking to relocate up here and that
 
04:30:15.290 --> 04:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
does happen quite frequently
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
particularly on the border of the states
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I want to also mention so one of the
 
04:30:23.330 --> 04:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
famous compacts that we all participate
 
04:30:25.969 --> 04:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
in is the driver's license compact
 
04:30:25.979 --> 04:30:27.410 align:start position:0%
in is the driver's license compact
so

04:30:27.410 --> 04:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:30.349 --> 04:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
um it we are part of a compact regarding
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses so in order for you to
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
drive through Massachusetts you don't
 
04:30:36.290 --> 04:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
need to go get a Massachusetts license
 
04:30:38.990 --> 04:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
you can drive to California
 
04:30:40.849 --> 04:30:40.859 align:start position:0%
um you only need one license and it's
 
04:30:42.950 --> 04:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
not until you change your domicile that
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
you need to get a new license this
 
04:30:47.450 --> 04:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
compact would work very very similar to
 
04:30:47.460 --> 04:30:49.130 align:start position:0%
compact would work very very similar to
that

04:30:49.130 --> 04:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:50.870 --> 04:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:53.929 --> 04:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
anyone else all right thank you
 
04:30:56.870 --> 04:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:31:03.410 --> 04:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:06.349 --> 04:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
 
04:31:08.570 --> 04:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
public hearing and representative Broder
 
04:31:10.969 --> 04:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
I believe you have a motion
 
04:31:13.689 --> 04:31:13.699 align:start position:0%
I do I wish to help retain House Bill
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I do because
 
04:31:26.389 --> 04:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
um the this committee has will be
 
04:31:28.250 --> 04:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
requesting that the board of mental
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
health portion of the of House Bill 2 be
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
pulled out so that we can look at it and
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
entirely and include this and this bill
 
04:31:41.330 --> 04:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
and possibly its amendment in that is uh
 
04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I think an appropriate thing to do
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
for our committee
 
04:31:48.170 --> 04:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to say the same thing
 
04:31:48.180 --> 04:31:49.969 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to say the same thing
we've

04:31:49.969 --> 04:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
we've
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have the time for this because
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
today is our deadline so we are going to
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
retain it and work on it we might
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
um depending on how quickly things come
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
together we might try and pass it as
 
04:32:07.729 --> 04:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
part of a Senate bill this this spring
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll work on it over the
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
summer and have something ready for the
 
04:32:14.929 --> 04:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
house in January
 
04:32:21.050 --> 04:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:23.870 --> 04:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
if if this is just coming off the
 
04:32:26.750 --> 04:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
printers to the other states now I don't
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be much of a delay
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%

the mental health issues and I've
 
04:32:41.450 --> 04:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
already started looking at that and I've
 
04:32:43.610 --> 04:32:43.620 align:start position:0%

04:32:45.710 --> 04:32:45.720 align:start position:0%

bipartisan team from both sides of the
wall

04:35:03.131 --> 04:35:03.141 align:start position:0%
wall
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
to address some issues on uh that were
 
04:35:08.631 --> 04:35:08.641 align:start position:0%
happening for the commission on Native
 
04:35:12.109 --> 04:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
Affairs and I would direct the
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee's attention to an email that
 
04:35:17.390 --> 04:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan sent to us all
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
this morning where I thought he really
 
04:35:22.369 --> 04:35:22.379 align:start position:0%
outlined kind of the history well and I
 
04:35:27.529 --> 04:35:27.539 align:start position:0%
won't dig into that in the process of
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
um working with the state veterans
 
04:35:36.349 --> 04:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
committee it became clear that uh as a
 
04:35:38.810 --> 04:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
surprise to me honestly this quickly in
 
04:35:40.250 --> 04:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
my uh term
 
04:35:43.010 --> 04:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire was ready to look at
 
04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
recognition of Abenaki people in New
 
04:35:47.449 --> 04:35:47.459 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so
 
04:35:49.369 --> 04:35:49.379 align:start position:0%
um I was very happy to have house bill
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
390 to be able to amend and a group of
 
04:35:54.890 --> 04:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
us worked on this amendment and the goal
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
is to do a study so that this committee
 
04:36:00.170 --> 04:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
will understand what is federal
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
recognition what is State recognition
 
04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
what is the state's Authority which was
 
04:36:09.650 --> 04:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
retained under RSA 14a part of the
 
04:36:14.209 --> 04:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
commission to recognize State tribes and
 
04:36:16.131 --> 04:36:16.141 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think that you're a pretty
 
04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
bright group that's been my experience
 
04:36:20.449 --> 04:36:20.459 align:start position:0%
and you'll learn a lot and I look
 
04:36:22.970 --> 04:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
forward to the study and I'd be happy to
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative lacas
 
04:36:31.730 --> 04:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so as I understand this is
 
04:36:33.590 --> 04:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
a study committee that has to there's a
 
04:36:36.310 --> 04:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
reporting date in November I believe
 
04:36:40.131 --> 04:36:40.141 align:start position:0%
correct on is that at that point the uh
 
04:36:42.529 --> 04:36:42.539 align:start position:0%
the study committee terminates correct
 
04:36:42.539 --> 04:36:44.750 align:start position:0%
the study committee terminates correct
follow-up

04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:36:48.410 --> 04:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah my only concern is um
 
04:36:50.109 --> 04:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
is there really going to be enough time
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
to do what needs to be done to you know
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
you have to get all these people
 
04:36:56.330 --> 04:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
together arrange meetings hopefully
 
04:36:58.250 --> 04:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
they'll show up and come out with a
 
04:37:00.410 --> 04:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
report in uh you know from the time this
 
04:37:02.750 --> 04:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill goes into effect and then
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
so I feel really confident that over the
 
04:37:06.551 --> 04:37:06.561 align:start position:0%
course of the summer that enough
 
04:37:10.609 --> 04:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
education can happen in order to submit
 
04:37:14.510 --> 04:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
a bill next fall that would be the next
 
04:37:16.369 --> 04:37:16.379 align:start position:0%
step and I see this thing happening in
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
very small chunks with bills to define
 
04:37:23.209 --> 04:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
the next step and that the legislature
 
04:37:26.570 --> 04:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
will be defining the way to proceed
 
04:37:29.810 --> 04:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
toward whether the state chooses to use
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
their statutory authority to recognize
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:05.390 --> 04:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to tell all the people that
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
want to take 10 minutes to tell us their
 
04:38:09.051 --> 04:38:09.061 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
 
04:38:13.010 --> 04:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
that we have all said we've pretty much
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
agreed that this bill as written is not
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
correct and should not go forward and
 
04:38:22.609 --> 04:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
Our intention is to retain it and work
 
04:38:26.090 --> 04:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
hopefully with your assistance so that
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
we will have something better for next
 
04:38:32.570 --> 04:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
year so I hope you will all choose to be
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
very brief
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:15.119 --> 04:39:19.929 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:39:19.929 --> 04:39:19.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
off with my apology I didn't bring
 
04:39:25.730 --> 04:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
enough copies there's several of you
 
04:39:29.289 --> 04:39:29.299 align:start position:0%
that didn't get copies I'm very sorry
 
04:39:32.689 --> 04:39:32.699 align:start position:0%
my name is Melinda Sims I am from

Belmont New Hampshire and I'm an abanaki
 
04:39:39.850 --> 04:39:39.860 align:start position:0%
native and a veteran disabled veteran
 
04:39:43.368 --> 04:39:43.378 align:start position:0%
I come I honorable chair and members of
 
04:39:44.930 --> 04:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you so much for
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
having me here today I come to you today
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
as a concerned constituent with Native
 
04:39:52.730 --> 04:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
American Heritage and a disabled veteran
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
HB 390 is a bill that essentially
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
rewrites the already established statute
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
that authorized the New Hampshire
 
04:40:03.050 --> 04:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
Commission on Native American Affairs it
 
04:40:05.150 --> 04:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
is not a simple bill it is a bill of
 
04:40:05.160 --> 04:40:06.410 align:start position:0%
is not a simple bill it is a bill of
deception

04:40:06.410 --> 04:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
deception
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
The Honorable committee is being
 
04:40:13.368 --> 04:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
deceived when hcr7 was recently tabled
 
04:40:16.010 --> 04:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
and the school combined the bill with HB
 
04:40:18.770 --> 04:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
390 and added a new amendment by
 
04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
combining these uh yes one second
 
04:40:24.110 --> 04:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:26.330 --> 04:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
yeah your microphone
 
04:40:28.670 --> 04:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm not sure if the
 
04:40:33.110 --> 04:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
witness knows but we do not tolerate in
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
in this committee personal attacks on
 
04:40:37.970 --> 04:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
anyone either a member of the committee
 
04:40:41.030 --> 04:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
or anyone else and so would it be
 
04:40:43.670 --> 04:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate to guide her to talk about
 
04:40:46.010 --> 04:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
the problems that she sees without
 
04:40:48.350 --> 04:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
attacking an individual yes thank you
 
04:40:50.810 --> 04:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
very much representative Smith we do our
 
04:40:52.368 --> 04:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
best within the committee in the house
 
04:40:53.630 --> 04:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
in general to make sure that we don't
 
04:40:55.730 --> 04:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
attribute motive to somebody else's
 
04:40:55.740 --> 04:40:59.270 align:start position:0%
attribute motive to somebody else's
actions

04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you
 
04:41:01.980 --> 04:41:04.910 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you
um

04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:08.150 --> 04:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
let's see by combining these bills they
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
will achieve the intent of hcr7 and
 
04:41:13.310 --> 04:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
erase the voice of most New Hampshire
 
04:41:16.430 --> 04:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
indigenous people and put
 
04:41:19.250 --> 04:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
the people from Vermont in the driver's
 
04:41:22.368 --> 04:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
seat this trickery will also remove the
 
04:41:24.830 --> 04:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
state's position of oversight and the
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
governor's ability to appoint commission
 
04:41:30.050 --> 04:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
members it will eliminate the New
 
04:41:31.490 --> 04:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Commission on Native American
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
Affairs we know this is to be true
 
04:41:37.750 --> 04:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
because 17 years ago
 
04:41:41.570 --> 04:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
the Vermont commission was dismantled at
 
04:41:44.448 --> 04:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
that time and stacked with like-minded
 
04:41:46.910 --> 04:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
people this is the very same thing
 
04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed now with this HB
 
04:41:52.970 --> 04:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
390 end amendment I understand the
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee is possibly bewildered by
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
what's going on here and are trying to
 
04:41:59.930 --> 04:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
make sense of what this is about perhaps
 
04:42:02.810 --> 04:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
you believe this is a family squabble I
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
assure you this is a personal power
 
04:42:07.610 --> 04:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
struggle for control of the state being
 
04:42:13.128 --> 04:42:13.138 align:start position:0%
waged by Vermont and against Paul and
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
Denise pulio
 
04:42:18.890 --> 04:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
this is evident in Section 3 of HB 390
 
04:42:21.770 --> 04:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
it states Chiefs and their parent child
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
sibling or spouse shall not be eligible
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
to serve in order to avoid a conflict of
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
interest the only people that this
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
caveat applies to are the chief speakers
 
04:42:36.050 --> 04:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
of the Penacook that is now that is how
 
04:42:38.090 --> 04:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to remove their
 
04:42:41.090 --> 04:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
voices this Clause would also make the
 
04:42:43.670 --> 04:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
Penacook speakers ineligible for a seat
 
04:42:47.208 --> 04:42:47.218 align:start position:0%
as affiliate faculty at UNH this bill is
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
an over attempt to silence them
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the Kawasaki band of
 
04:42:56.570 --> 04:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
the Abenaki people already have an
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
inclusive tribal Community with two head
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
speakers Denise and Paul puleo
 
04:43:06.050 --> 04:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
we do have a New Hampshire Commission on
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
Native American Affairs we have a tribal
 
04:43:12.050 --> 04:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
consultation office at the University of
 
04:43:15.050 --> 04:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is foundational in
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
establishing the UNH Native American in
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
indigenous studies program
 
04:43:23.510 --> 04:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
and our head speakers have implemented a
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
501 c 3 organization to assist our
 
04:43:27.120 --> 04:43:28.510 align:start position:0%
501 c 3 organization to assist our
community

04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:43:32.750 --> 04:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
we are a thriving giving community that
 
04:43:35.208 --> 04:43:35.218 align:start position:0%
does not have its hand out to the state
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
we are not in need of other entities for
 
04:43:43.128 --> 04:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
us or changing what is already here
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
allowing this bill and amendment to pass
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
you are not helping the indigenous
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
Community or taxpayers of New Hampshire
 
04:43:54.770 --> 04:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
instead you'll open Pandora's Box I hold
 
04:43:58.390 --> 04:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:00.490 --> 04:44:00.500 align:start position:0%
140 bills
 
04:44:04.730 --> 04:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
brought before the Vermont legislature
 
04:44:09.128 --> 04:44:09.138 align:start position:0%
by the nelhegan ban between 2009 and
 
04:44:12.670 --> 04:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
2023. each bill costs the state money
 
04:44:16.490 --> 04:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
lots of money and this is most likely to
 
04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
happen to the New Hampshire taxpayers
 
04:44:22.850 --> 04:44:22.860 align:start position:0%
too if this bill and amendment is passed
 
04:44:25.970 --> 04:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
just like in Vermont miss school
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
just like in Vermont
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
they are attempting to take over the
 
04:44:32.208 --> 04:44:32.218 align:start position:0%
already quite thriving New Hampshire
 
04:44:35.570 --> 04:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
indigenous community and instead they
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:41.570 --> 04:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
to get additional funding from New
 
04:44:44.030 --> 04:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and be the only recipient of
 
04:44:47.090 --> 04:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
federal funds or grants and glean from
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:53.930 --> 04:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
if you give them an inch they'll take a
 
04:44:56.570 --> 04:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
mile they'll not stop here they'll bleed
 
04:44:59.090 --> 04:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
the state dry with never-ending bills
 
04:45:01.610 --> 04:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
for monies and benefits like what's
 
04:45:03.770 --> 04:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
already been done with to the state of
 
04:45:03.780 --> 04:45:04.730 align:start position:0%
already been done with to the state of
Vermont

04:45:04.730 --> 04:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
04:45:07.788 --> 04:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
our head speakers Paul and Denise puleo
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't cause problems for New Hampshire
 
04:45:12.288 --> 04:45:12.298 align:start position:0%
they don't have their hand out to New
 
04:45:14.690 --> 04:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they've actually solved
 
04:45:17.208 --> 04:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
problems they have a great rapport with
 
04:45:19.010 --> 04:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and through
 
04:45:21.288 --> 04:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
numerous wonderful projects have
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
spearheaded that are spearheaded by our
 
04:45:27.530 --> 04:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
speakers they provide Revenue to our
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
great state I respectfully urge you to
 
04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
vote itl HB 390 and its Amendment
 
04:45:38.448 --> 04:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for this time for listening
 
04:45:40.610 --> 04:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
04:45:43.070 --> 04:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:45:46.868 --> 04:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'm especially wondering uh because this
 
04:45:56.170 --> 04:45:56.180 align:start position:0%
proposed study committee is made up of
 
04:45:59.050 --> 04:45:59.060 align:start position:0%
people or entities
 
04:46:03.410 --> 04:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
um unknown to most of us I'm sure uh or
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
not well understood so uh can you
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
comment or perhaps somebody else is
 
04:46:19.368 --> 04:46:19.378 align:start position:0%
going to testify comment on lines uh 18
 
04:46:19.378 --> 04:46:20.150 align:start position:0%
going to testify comment on lines uh 18
um

04:46:20.150 --> 04:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:20.160 --> 04:46:22.150 align:start position:0%
um
through

04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:46:26.208 --> 04:46:26.218 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the page 29 but the
 
04:46:28.128 --> 04:46:28.138 align:start position:0%
constituent elements of the study
 
04:46:30.110 --> 04:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee because I think uh
 
04:46:31.250 --> 04:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Smith just for
 
04:46:32.510 --> 04:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
clarification are you talking about the
 
04:46:34.670 --> 04:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
amendment or the bill itself talking
 
04:46:38.330 --> 04:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
about the bill itself okay because
 
04:46:40.690 --> 04:46:40.700 align:start position:0%
we haven't amended it yet
 
04:46:40.700 --> 04:46:42.368 align:start position:0%
we haven't amended it yet
so

04:46:42.368 --> 04:46:42.378 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:45.530 --> 04:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment deals with the
 
04:46:47.330 --> 04:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
study committee the underlying Bill
 
04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
deals with the commission
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps Mike my question is not
 
04:47:01.368 --> 04:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
appropriate anymore because again I
 
04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
think this is
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous territory for this committee
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative crota
 
04:47:15.050 --> 04:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
thing so I think that um
 
04:47:17.810 --> 04:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
I want to reiterate what chairman
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
Maguire said I think the committee
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
recognizes the um disagreement within
 
04:47:23.520 --> 04:47:25.190 align:start position:0%
recognizes the um disagreement within
the

04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:25.200 --> 04:47:26.690 align:start position:0%
the
uh

04:47:26.690 --> 04:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
parties and this is not a place for the
 
04:47:30.000 --> 04:47:31.250 align:start position:0%
parties and this is not a place for the
legislature

04:47:31.250 --> 04:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we are going to be making a
 
04:47:38.270 --> 04:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation to retain the bill which
 
04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
is why we want to make sure that people
 
04:47:45.708 --> 04:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.650 --> 04:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
um we
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
start debating issues that at this point
 
04:48:03.708 --> 04:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
honorable McGuire may I say something to
 
04:48:06.480 --> 04:48:07.788 align:start position:0%
honorable McGuire may I say something to
that

04:48:07.788 --> 04:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:10.610 --> 04:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
or no well I I don't know the rules I'm
 
04:48:15.410 --> 04:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
sorry oh well the she's just saying that
 
04:48:17.810 --> 04:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
we've gotten all your letters and emails
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
and we've read them and you've convinced
 
04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
us this bill is not ready to go ahead so
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
we want to work on it with yours your
 
04:48:25.200 --> 04:48:26.030 align:start position:0%
we want to work on it with yours your
help

04:48:26.030 --> 04:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
and retaining us will let us do that
 
04:48:32.690 --> 04:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
is is that click do you wish to add
 
04:48:35.330 --> 04:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:38.270 --> 04:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
I just think that
 
04:48:41.570 --> 04:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
um there's not Clarity I think that
 
04:48:44.990 --> 04:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
again the the majority of you think it's
 
04:48:48.170 --> 04:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
a family squabble and it's it's not that
 
04:48:51.890 --> 04:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh we already have
 
04:48:56.208 --> 04:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
a system in place in in New Hampshire
 
04:48:58.850 --> 04:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
but somebody from the outside is coming
 
04:49:01.850 --> 04:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
in to replace our system what's the
 
04:49:05.510 --> 04:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
sense in that I don't understand this
 
04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
as we said it needs a lot more work
 
04:49:11.208 --> 04:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
including to find out why why if there
 
04:49:16.368 --> 04:49:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:16.378 --> 04:49:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:21.170 --> 04:49:21.180 align:start position:0%

I've had the pleasure of being guided
 
04:50:19.850 --> 04:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
and in my indigenous Journey as a Taino
 
04:50:23.770 --> 04:50:23.780 align:start position:0%
by the great leaders as Denise polio
 
04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
and and her husband
 
04:50:29.690 --> 04:50:29.700 align:start position:0%

appointed by Governor Chris sununu
 
04:50:38.510 --> 04:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
something rare actually as a Democrat
 
04:50:40.550 --> 04:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
supported by a current governor that
 
04:50:42.170 --> 04:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
sees the need for my people to be
 
04:50:44.208 --> 04:50:44.218 align:start position:0%
represented here in New Hampshire in
 
04:50:44.218 --> 04:50:45.850 align:start position:0%
represented here in New Hampshire in
2010

04:50:45.850 --> 04:50:45.860 align:start position:0%
2010
 
04:50:48.590 --> 04:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
the state felt the need to create this
 
04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
commission that allows all indigenous
 
04:50:53.810 --> 04:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
voices to be represented currently the
 
04:50:55.730 --> 04:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
largest group of indigenous people in
 
04:50:57.410 --> 04:50:57.420 align:start position:0%

Puerto Rican
 
04:51:06.288 --> 04:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
17 000 of them this current bill
 
04:51:09.530 --> 04:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
as it stands we'll get rid of the two
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
Taino voices in the commission and would
 
04:51:14.090 --> 04:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from sitting there in that
 
04:51:16.490 --> 04:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
Commission in the future the amendment
 
04:51:19.250 --> 04:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
the amendment as I I'm hearing about it
 
04:51:23.390 --> 04:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
is also concerning so as a member of My
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%

04:51:26.510 --> 04:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
representing here in the state of New
 
04:51:28.190 --> 04:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I asked you to please just
 
04:51:30.530 --> 04:51:30.540 align:start position:0%

04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
letter from the chairwoman from our
 
04:51:32.878 --> 04:51:34.270 align:start position:0%
letter from the chairwoman from our
commission

04:51:34.270 --> 04:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
commission

Marjorie Smith I will not be reading
 
04:51:43.368 --> 04:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
some of the comments in this letter as
 
04:51:45.110 --> 04:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
it does pertain to a specific state
 
04:51:47.690 --> 04:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative on the committee but I
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
and I won't read them but I do want to
 
04:51:51.170 --> 04:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
make sure that you guys know that there
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
are some extreme concerns for my
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
community and the lack of representation

I am a woman of mixed Heritage with my

I am not a member of an Abenaki tribe
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
and do not have Abenaki Heritage to my
 
04:53:30.958 --> 04:53:32.150 align:start position:0%
and do not have Abenaki Heritage to my
knowledge

04:53:32.150 --> 04:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is deeply flawed in the
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
amendment even more so
 
04:53:39.288 --> 04:53:39.298 align:start position:0%
I have given you a handout also posted
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
on the portal and sent to each of you
 
04:53:43.730 --> 04:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
via email explaining exactly why I
 
04:53:46.010 --> 04:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
believe the bill is flawed
 
04:53:48.050 --> 04:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
if you have been told that the
 
04:53:49.970 --> 04:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
commission does not function as it
 
04:53:52.970 --> 04:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
should and in compliance with state law
 
04:53:55.550 --> 04:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
I suggest that you reach out to the
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
commission or to myself with any
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
04:54:03.530 --> 04:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
it is always wise before committing to a
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
decision to be certain that all of the
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
facts that you have been given are
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
actually accurate and truthful
 
04:54:13.310 --> 04:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
I believe this is your duty as elected
 
04:54:13.320 --> 04:54:14.628 align:start position:0%
I believe this is your duty as elected
officials

04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:54:16.910 --> 04:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 390 would remove every
 
04:54:18.410 --> 04:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
current member of the commission and
 
04:54:20.510 --> 04:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
replace it with appointments made by the
 
04:54:22.550 --> 04:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
four Chiefs of the four four Vermont
 
04:54:25.190 --> 04:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
recognized Abenaki bands
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
there are many problems with that
 
04:54:29.930 --> 04:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
including that at least two of the bands
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
do not wish to interfere with New
 
04:54:33.230 --> 04:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire politics
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
were not consulted on this bill
 
04:54:38.208 --> 04:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
nor was the New Hampshire commission
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
consulted on the bill
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
there is testimony on your portal from
 
04:54:44.990 --> 04:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
both Chief Shirley hook who was one of
 
04:54:46.490 --> 04:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
the one of the chiefs of the Florida
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont recognized tribes and chair and
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
Jennison of the commission
 
04:54:54.650 --> 04:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
the proposed structure of this rewrite
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
places undue power in the hands of
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont tribes and disenfranchises all
 
04:55:01.610 --> 04:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire bands in indigenous
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
citizens who are not members of them
 
04:55:07.310 --> 04:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
Additionally the current commission
 
04:55:10.368 --> 04:55:10.378 align:start position:0%
members who have appointed seats and who
 
04:55:12.350 --> 04:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
have been extremely helpful through the
 
04:55:15.890 --> 04:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
years would be removed as well
 
04:55:17.930 --> 04:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
although the amendment was not passed
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
around to the audience I have seen a
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
copy of it and I wish to say that it is
 
04:55:25.128 --> 04:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
not germane to the language in House
 
04:55:27.530 --> 04:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 390 as presented
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
from reviewing your rules I learn a
 
04:55:32.570 --> 04:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
committee of conference May either
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
change the title of any Bill submitted
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
to it nor add amendments that are not
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
germane to the subject matter of the
 
04:55:40.610 --> 04:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
bill as originally submitted I'm sorry
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me yes for your information a
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill to a an amendment to take a bill
 
04:55:49.150 --> 04:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
and change it into a study committee
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
generally related to the topic of the
 
04:55:53.690 --> 04:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
bill has been declared to be always
 
04:55:56.750 --> 04:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
germane okay thank you and we're nowhere
 
04:55:58.330 --> 04:55:58.340 align:start position:0%

has put forth in the uh document that I
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
reviewed is extremely concerning biased
 
04:56:16.128 --> 04:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
is not inclusive of indigenous people in
 
04:56:17.330 --> 04:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:56:21.610 --> 04:56:21.620 align:start position:0%
and frankly as a retired educator
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me like a group of uh
 
04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
students getting together to write their
 
04:56:32.448 --> 04:56:32.458 align:start position:0%

04:59:10.190 --> 04:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and also a veteran I also
 
04:59:11.930 --> 04:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
04:59:15.170 --> 04:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
it's strongly worded against peoples
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
that are not recognized in this state
 
04:59:20.810 --> 04:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
if recognition is the ultimate goal I
 
04:59:23.930 --> 04:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
would strongly suggest a study group be
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
formed under the jurisdiction of this
 
04:59:29.330 --> 04:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
commission to better acknowledge the
 
04:59:32.270 --> 04:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
folks that live here still in this state
 
04:59:35.390 --> 04:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
this bill cannot stand as it is
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:44.570 --> 04:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:53.890 --> 04:59:53.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay hello my name is Fawn Gaudet um
 
04:59:58.610 --> 04:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you state representatives for your
 
05:00:00.610 --> 05:00:00.620 align:start position:0%
service and thank you honorable veterans
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
one thing as being a person of
 
05:00:04.850 --> 05:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
indigenous is
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
um descent we all recognize that we all
 
05:00:09.410 --> 05:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
are in relationship together on this
 
05:00:12.050 --> 05:00:12.060 align:start position:0%
Earth and we are taking this opportunity
 
05:00:14.390 --> 05:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
to open the doors for conversation and I
 
05:00:17.628 --> 05:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
hope that what happens in this that we
 
05:00:20.448 --> 05:00:20.458 align:start position:0%
can keep an ongoing discussion with all
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the many leaders of the state because
 
05:00:25.730 --> 05:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
there are many groups in the state and
 
05:00:27.650 --> 05:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
many leaders that you might not be aware
 
05:00:27.660 --> 05:00:28.430 align:start position:0%
many leaders that you might not be aware
of

05:00:28.430 --> 05:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:00:30.170 --> 05:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
being a proud descendant of the
 
05:00:31.970 --> 05:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
blackfeet nation and a New Hampshire
 
05:00:33.530 --> 05:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
resident my mother was an enrolled
 
05:00:35.628 --> 05:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
member of the blackfeet tribe my father
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
has indigenous blood as well I am proud
 
05:00:39.910 --> 05:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
of my mixed Heritage
 
05:00:42.110 --> 05:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
my experience with this federally
 
05:00:44.208 --> 05:00:44.218 align:start position:0%
recognized tribe and I lived on the
 
05:00:46.090 --> 05:00:46.100 align:start position:0%
Navajo reservation too so it's another
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
experience makes me aware of the many
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
issues proposed in this bill I feel that
 
05:00:51.948 --> 05:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
you may have thought this was the road
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
to go down but in kindness with the hope
 
05:00:56.090 --> 05:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
you with who you are I hope that you
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
would not condone such things in this
 
05:00:59.628 --> 05:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
bill and the proposed amendment and I
 
05:01:02.330 --> 05:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
would like to share that we heard about
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
the bill but the bill the amendment was
 
05:01:06.050 --> 05:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
not posted
 
05:01:06.060 --> 05:01:06.830 align:start position:0%
not posted
um

05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:10.670 --> 05:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
in a spirit of openness that was
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I feel it would have been better if
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
that was more open for us to see that in
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
more fair I want to say one thing the
 
05:01:18.890 --> 05:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
commission is functioning just fine and
 
05:01:20.690 --> 05:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
within the commission it's capable of
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
working on state
 
05:01:26.690 --> 05:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
um recognition I think that
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
um another thing is proposability is
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
that you have the opportunity to um
 
05:01:34.850 --> 05:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's opening the door for you
 
05:01:36.650 --> 05:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
picking winners to losers and that does
 
05:01:38.690 --> 05:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
damage to many indigenous peoples in the
 
05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
state by taking where our voices on the
 
05:01:42.590 --> 05:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
commission for people that are in the
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
state that live and people like me that
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
you know our tribe is not from the state
 
05:01:48.770 --> 05:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
Assad it's me to share when one group is
 
05:01:50.090 --> 05:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
willing to put itself above another
 
05:01:52.368 --> 05:01:52.378 align:start position:0%
group this bill
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and let me be clear that no tribe
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of who they say they are has
 
05:01:58.730 --> 05:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
a right to a govern another state group
 
05:02:02.150 --> 05:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
or attempt to take control
 
05:02:04.128 --> 05:02:04.138 align:start position:0%
um the bill wants to give the bill wants
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
to do so by giving control to Vermont in
 
05:02:08.030 --> 05:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
groups in the New Hampshire Commission
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
of Native American Affairs if you pass
 
05:02:11.990 --> 05:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation with this you are
 
05:02:14.270 --> 05:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
contributing to it I hope that you will
 
05:02:15.650 --> 05:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
search in your hearts to say that this
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
is not a positive way to move forward
 
05:02:20.930 --> 05:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
indeed it causes a great deal of harm to
 
05:02:22.850 --> 05:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples in New Hampshire and
 
05:02:25.128 --> 05:02:25.138 align:start position:0%
as Kathleen stated there were Chiefs in
 
05:02:27.410 --> 05:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I mean Chiefs in Vermont
 
05:02:29.448 --> 05:02:29.458 align:start position:0%
that oppose this bill there are other
 
05:02:32.030 --> 05:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
group leaders in New Hampshire that
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill there is over I believe
 
05:02:36.788 --> 05:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
130 something
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples
 
05:02:42.890 --> 05:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
um in this that oppose this and I hope
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
that you'll get a chance to read all of
 
05:02:47.330 --> 05:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
their testimony
 
05:02:49.490 --> 05:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
in addition the native commission has
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
places for other indigenous people that
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
would lose spots as the amendment and
 
05:02:56.868 --> 05:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
the bill have stated I do not feel this
 
05:02:58.850 --> 05:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
just I will want to be very clear that
 
05:03:00.830 --> 05:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
one group or tribe does not speak for
 
05:03:02.690 --> 05:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
all of the indigenous peoples in New
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I want to share this term with
 
05:03:07.670 --> 05:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
compassion and openness this is a term
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
called paper genocide this proposed
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation or races and Indigenous
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
voices of New Hampshire that reside here
 
05:03:17.530 --> 05:03:17.540 align:start position:0%
in people that have come here
 
05:03:20.270 --> 05:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
surely maintaining inclusivity is
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
important to the state of New Hampshire
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
and all of you
 
05:03:25.610 --> 05:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
because we stand for truth and as
 
05:03:27.288 --> 05:03:27.298 align:start position:0%
committee members and legislators you
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
have the power to make sure this does
 
05:03:32.570 --> 05:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:37.250 --> 05:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
I hope that you will itl this bill
 
05:03:39.050 --> 05:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
and I hope that if you have any
 
05:03:42.410 --> 05:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
questions that feel free to please ask
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%

05:03:46.850 --> 05:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
that you can come come to the and
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
explore the rich culture and
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
contributions that indigenous peoples
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
bring to the state and have been working
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
on in this state
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%

we are here to uplift our Greater

Community not just our tribe in our
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
society we are judged not by what wealth
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
we accumulate but by what wealth we can
 
05:07:07.670 --> 05:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
give to others to go forward in a proper
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
way to maintain peace love joy
 
05:07:13.430 --> 05:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
righteousness and to empower one another
 
05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
in life
 
05:07:17.330 --> 05:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
in 2010 we worked with Winchester
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Carr to create the
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Commission on Native
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
American Affairs as a tribe we already
 
05:07:25.610 --> 05:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
had a government-to-government
 
05:07:27.170 --> 05:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
relationship with the state of New
 
05:07:27.180 --> 05:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
relationship with the state of New
Hampshire

05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
so we specifically wrote the Bill that
 
05:07:32.330 --> 05:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
honored our inclusive views and
 
05:07:34.250 --> 05:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
developed commission requirements that
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
included the diversity of indigenous
 
05:07:37.850 --> 05:07:37.860 align:start position:0%
people that are now residents of New
 
05:07:37.860 --> 05:07:38.810 align:start position:0%
people that are now residents of New
Hampshire

05:07:38.810 --> 05:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:07:41.208 --> 05:07:41.218 align:start position:0%
we are disappointed that in the last
 
05:07:43.490 --> 05:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
election brought forward divisiveness
 
05:07:46.610 --> 05:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
and this type of legislative drama this
 
05:07:48.890 --> 05:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
is not a family issue we are not the
 
05:07:50.570 --> 05:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
only tribe speaking out against this
 
05:07:53.150 --> 05:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
legislation testimony has come in from
 
05:07:55.310 --> 05:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
tribes all over the world speaking out
 
05:07:58.490 --> 05:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
against hb390 and the amendment because
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation is not our way
 
05:08:03.770 --> 05:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
we are here to defend our people the
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
greater indigenous Community residing
 
05:08:07.970 --> 05:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
here in the state as well as the state
 
05:08:11.690 --> 05:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:14.030 --> 05:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
I have a question before I even give
 
05:08:18.288 --> 05:08:18.298 align:start position:0%
testimony explicitly on the HP 390.
 
05:08:19.910 --> 05:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
um when you talk about re retaining this
 
05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
for study are you talking about the
 
05:08:28.128 --> 05:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
original bill or the amendment both
 
05:08:32.690 --> 05:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
all right then that opens my testimony
 
05:08:32.700 --> 05:08:33.350 align:start position:0%
all right then that opens my testimony
um

05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:35.448 --> 05:08:35.458 align:start position:0%
it's been alluded to that this was a
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
charge from the
 
05:08:40.970 --> 05:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
to have a committee or some pathway for
 
05:08:43.910 --> 05:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
State recognition and I want to point
 
05:08:46.190 --> 05:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
out that it says very clearly in the
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment for abnaki tribes
 
05:08:53.448 --> 05:08:53.458 align:start position:0%
that's already restricting the process
 
05:08:55.868 --> 05:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
I'd like to also point out by because
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
the representative who presented this
 
05:09:04.850 --> 05:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
and HCR 7 when they presented their uh
 
05:09:07.128 --> 05:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
their resolution to recognize themselves
 
05:09:09.170 --> 05:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
they're very clear that they started
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
with a preamble that talked about their
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
land claim from Northern Hampshire
 
05:09:16.310 --> 05:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
it also said there was a lot of federal
 
05:09:18.530 --> 05:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
things that they wanted to seek and
 
05:09:20.750 --> 05:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
those Federal things all have physical
 
05:09:23.330 --> 05:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility
 
05:09:25.788 --> 05:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
I want you to be cautioned that if
 
05:09:27.470 --> 05:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
you're retaining us for study and you're
 
05:09:29.990 --> 05:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment as well
 
05:09:32.150 --> 05:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
there are several references to
 
05:09:33.948 --> 05:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
non-governmental agencies that are going
 
05:09:35.330 --> 05:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
to be Consultants
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's no prior informed consent from
 
05:09:39.650 --> 05:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
any of these groups to participate and
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
this has been a problem with legislation
 
05:09:43.690 --> 05:09:43.700 align:start position:0%
in the state where you
 
05:09:46.150 --> 05:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
legislate in
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
faculty members from colleges and
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
institutions they have no legislative
 
05:09:55.310 --> 05:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility to comply with any of
 
05:09:56.930 --> 05:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
your study groups
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
what this really requires is
 
05:10:01.010 --> 05:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
professionals to be involved and this
 
05:10:04.250 --> 05:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
has a very significant fiscal note you
 
05:10:06.830 --> 05:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
need experts you cannot come up with a
 
05:10:10.190 --> 05:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
process unless you have experts like you
 
05:10:12.590 --> 05:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
already heard in previous testimony
 
05:10:15.830 --> 05:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's a slippery slope when we don't take
 
05:10:18.770 --> 05:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
any money we deliberately will not pay
 
05:10:21.410 --> 05:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
ourselves we roll all of our monies that
 
05:10:23.930 --> 05:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
we get from federal and state grants and
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
other institutions back into projects as
 
05:10:28.910 --> 05:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
a tribe we we try to uplift our
 
05:10:30.530 --> 05:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
community and we spend all of the money
 
05:10:32.930 --> 05:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
on projects not on wages
 
05:10:34.910 --> 05:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's a very clear distinction from
 
05:10:37.250 --> 05:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
other groups that look at this as a
 
05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
revenue to pay their membership and
 
05:10:40.070 --> 05:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
their leadership
 
05:10:42.110 --> 05:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
I don't see how this has any clear
 
05:10:45.230 --> 05:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
process to go forward the amendment
 
05:10:46.850 --> 05:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
the people that are put here are not
 
05:10:49.208 --> 05:10:49.218 align:start position:0%
qualified to do any recognition
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
especially deciding who's going to be on
 
05:10:53.288 --> 05:10:53.298 align:start position:0%
the Commission in the beginning
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
you need some very skilled professionals
 
05:10:58.970 --> 05:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
ethno historians
 
05:11:00.530 --> 05:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
um G
 
05:11:03.050 --> 05:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
certified National Certified genealogist
 
05:11:04.970 --> 05:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
not just randomly saying somebody's a
 
05:11:07.430 --> 05:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
genealogist you need some really serious
 
05:11:09.770 --> 05:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
things which would be very similar to
 
05:11:11.930 --> 05:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
what the federal government has that's
 
05:11:14.030 --> 05:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
why we're following federal guidelines
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
for our own recognition we're not
 
05:11:17.330 --> 05:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
seeking this we never asked you for this
 
05:11:19.490 --> 05:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
we never asked to be here
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
any of the bills this year we're just
 
05:11:22.910 --> 05:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
trying to defend us except for the
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
Columbus State though except for
 
05:11:25.910 --> 05:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day I have to give that one up
 
05:11:28.730 --> 05:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
but to keep on Integra integrating into
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
these conversations the museum the
 
05:11:33.890 --> 05:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
cursed Indian museum or Dartmouth we
 
05:11:35.330 --> 05:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
have found from the past that Dartmouth
 
05:11:37.430 --> 05:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
will not even put a representative on
 
05:11:38.330 --> 05:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
the commission of Native American
 
05:11:38.340 --> 05:11:39.470 align:start position:0%
the commission of Native American
Affairs

05:11:39.470 --> 05:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
Affairs
 
05:11:43.310 --> 05:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
so teachers and professes unobligated to
 
05:11:45.530 --> 05:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
do their own work they're not obligated
 
05:11:47.270 --> 05:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
to do your legislative work
 
05:11:50.330 --> 05:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
so think about it seriously and think
 
05:11:52.550 --> 05:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
about those those somewhat over 100
 
05:11:55.070 --> 05:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
bills that were passed in Vermont in the
 
05:11:57.770 --> 05:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
physical fiscal uh note that it
 
05:12:00.410 --> 05:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
presented to uh Vermont citizens
 
05:12:00.420 --> 05:12:02.390 align:start position:0%
presented to uh Vermont citizens
forevermore

05:12:02.390 --> 05:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
forevermore
 
05:12:05.170 --> 05:12:05.180 align:start position:0%
it was very clear in the testimony and
 
05:12:09.530 --> 05:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
HCI 7 that excuse me we haven't heard
 
05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
hcr7 that was an entirely different
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee well I I understand that I'm
 
05:12:15.530 --> 05:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna try to tie it in because
 
05:12:17.810 --> 05:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
the representative did open the door
 
05:12:19.850 --> 05:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
there was testimony that they were
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
seeking Federal money I don't know how
 
05:12:23.570 --> 05:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
you can explain to your constituents
 
05:12:26.208 --> 05:12:26.218 align:start position:0%
that you're going to allow another
 
05:12:28.310 --> 05:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
outside State group
 
05:12:32.030 --> 05:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
tie into and tap into monies that were
 
05:12:34.430 --> 05:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
raised here from the federal system by
 
05:12:36.288 --> 05:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
our residents to be transferred to
 
05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont period this is a very you know
 
05:12:40.730 --> 05:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be fiscal
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
conservatives why would you lead a path
 
05:12:47.090 --> 05:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
for Vermont group to tap into New
 
05:12:49.610 --> 05:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's state revenues period I mean
 
05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
this is just common sense stuff I don't
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know all the rest of it it uh I
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
don't see any prior informed consent and
 
05:12:59.150 --> 05:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's been a political issue there's no
 
05:13:00.890 --> 05:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
indigenous consultation in this
 
05:13:04.250 --> 05:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
amendment none and how we expected to
 
05:13:06.230 --> 05:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
follow your proceedings as you do a
 
05:13:07.850 --> 05:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
retained for study how are we supposed
 
05:13:09.410 --> 05:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
to do that exactly
 
05:13:11.330 --> 05:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
I mean when we're not allowed on to
 
05:13:13.310 --> 05:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
participate and we're not allowed as a
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
Consulting party based on this as well I
 
05:13:17.330 --> 05:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
mean so we have a lot of questions there
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
are a lot of issues with the amendment
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
and the initial bill within itself
 
05:13:23.810 --> 05:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
um we think that the best move for this
 
05:13:27.170 --> 05:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
committee would be to itl this bill to
 
05:13:29.868 --> 05:13:29.878 align:start position:0%
have new legislation brought forth in
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
the fall the commission is already has
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
the tools needed to establish a
 
05:13:38.090 --> 05:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
recognition process in the state the
 
05:13:40.010 --> 05:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
tribes that are resident in the state
 
05:13:42.530 --> 05:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
are already participating on that
 
05:13:45.050 --> 05:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
commission so you would have indigenous
 
05:13:45.060 --> 05:13:46.430 align:start position:0%
commission so you would have indigenous
consultation

05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
consultation
 
05:13:49.010 --> 05:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
so our recommendation is to itl this
 
05:13:52.128 --> 05:13:52.138 align:start position:0%
bill and we thank you for listening to
 
05:13:54.410 --> 05:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
us today and we're welcome we welcome
 
05:13:56.330 --> 05:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have
 
05:13:57.890 --> 05:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:01.070 --> 05:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
05:14:04.030 --> 05:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
05:14:08.810 --> 05:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
since there's been reference to hcr7 I
 
05:14:12.530 --> 05:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
sat in on that hearing uh and a question
 
05:14:16.730 --> 05:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
I have is whether either
 
05:14:19.128 --> 05:14:19.138 align:start position:0%
well especially the amendment which I
 
05:14:20.650 --> 05:14:20.660 align:start position:0%
don't seem to have
 
05:14:24.050 --> 05:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
whether the amendment in any way picks
 
05:14:27.650 --> 05:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
up the subman's sum and substance of
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
hcr7 which has already been heard and
 
05:14:33.000 --> 05:14:34.128 align:start position:0%
hcr7 which has already been heard and
voted

05:14:34.128 --> 05:14:34.138 align:start position:0%
voted
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
I believe itl right correct so to the
 
05:14:38.690 --> 05:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
degree that we are
 
05:14:42.530 --> 05:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
getting a do-over in in the on the part
 
05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
of thank you on the part of the uh uh on
 
05:14:49.430 --> 05:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
the part of the the amendment I have I
 
05:14:53.208 --> 05:14:53.218 align:start position:0%
think we need to look at that because
 
05:14:55.310 --> 05:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's already been dealt with already
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
ideal'd uh and I believe it's all been
 
05:15:01.490 --> 05:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
already been voted on in the house floor
 
05:15:05.030 --> 05:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh so
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
I I I really want to bring that up to
 
05:15:11.448 --> 05:15:11.458 align:start position:0%
the attention of the chair not not to
 
05:15:15.230 --> 05:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
the testifiers because this is this is
 
05:15:18.708 --> 05:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:21.530 --> 05:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
so to the degree that HCR has already
 
05:15:24.350 --> 05:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
been voted on already been ideal by the
 
05:15:24.360 --> 05:15:25.430 align:start position:0%
been voted on already been ideal by the
house

05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:15:29.090 --> 05:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
yes on that is right something that we
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
cannot yes and that's that the amendment
 
05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
is a do-over in any way
 
05:15:39.770 --> 05:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not familiar enough with how hcr7
 
05:15:43.610 --> 05:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
to say whether or not it is a do-over
 
05:15:45.890 --> 05:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's that's exactly why I'm raising
 
05:15:47.930 --> 05:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
the point we we are entering into
 
05:15:51.890 --> 05:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
perilous Waters in my opinion uh on some
 
05:15:55.788 --> 05:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
subject that we uh uh have little to no
 
05:15:58.490 --> 05:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
expertise on thank you thank you thank
 
05:16:00.170 --> 05:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
you may I follow up with one other
 
05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
question one of the letters that we
 
05:16:08.090 --> 05:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
received is uh from uh I I and I want to
 
05:16:11.690 --> 05:16:11.700 align:start position:0%
have a quick uh ruling of the chair
 
05:16:14.030 --> 05:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
whether that needs to be entered into
 
05:16:16.430 --> 05:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
more than just submitted to us in
 
05:16:19.970 --> 05:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
writing uh the letter I'm referring to
 
05:16:23.330 --> 05:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
was sent by Anna Jenison
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
who might happen to know personally and
 
05:16:29.448 --> 05:16:29.458 align:start position:0%
she is the chair yes she is the chair of
 
05:16:31.250 --> 05:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Commission on Native
 
05:16:33.470 --> 05:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
American Affairs so I think we really
 
05:16:34.670 --> 05:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
need to
 
05:16:36.830 --> 05:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
handle this more than just putting it
 
05:16:39.890 --> 05:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
into our written file so I I was asking
 
05:16:44.330 --> 05:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
Richard's ruling on that yes it will be
 
05:16:46.490 --> 05:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
there and
 
05:16:49.730 --> 05:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:52.430 --> 05:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
we all have some light reading to do on
 
05:16:55.070 --> 05:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
this stack of papers yes I also wanted
 
05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
to thank representative Schmidt um the
 
05:16:58.970 --> 05:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
amendment has still not been publicly
 
05:17:02.690 --> 05:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
posted it so we have yet to find that
 
05:17:05.510 --> 05:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
available online anywhere it is not an
 
05:17:08.090 --> 05:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
it amendments are never online until
 
05:17:10.430 --> 05:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
they have been voted by the committee
 
05:17:14.090 --> 05:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you did you get a paper copy
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
at least
 
05:17:17.390 --> 05:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
um so I was able to secure with with
 
05:17:19.670 --> 05:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
extreme difficulty a copy of the
 
05:17:19.680 --> 05:17:20.750 align:start position:0%
extreme difficulty a copy of the
amendment

05:17:20.750 --> 05:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:17:22.670 --> 05:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
um but it was but it has not been made
 
05:17:25.550 --> 05:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
to the um I have shared that version you
 
05:17:27.110 --> 05:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
know the copy that I've received as
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
widely as I could so um on some of the
 
05:17:31.850 --> 05:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
portal comments you will notice that
 
05:17:34.490 --> 05:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
some of them will refer to HB 390 and
 
05:17:34.500 --> 05:17:35.868 align:start position:0%
some of them will refer to HB 390 and
Amendment

05:17:35.868 --> 05:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
05:17:37.550 --> 05:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
um that's because those individuals were
 
05:17:39.170 --> 05:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
able to see the amendment because we
 
05:17:41.030 --> 05:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
shared that with them where some
 
05:17:42.650 --> 05:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
comments do not refer to the amendment
 
05:17:44.170 --> 05:17:44.180 align:start position:0%
because it was not publicly made
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
until after a certain point in the
 
05:17:53.878 --> 05:17:55.128 align:start position:0%
until after a certain point in the
process

05:17:55.128 --> 05:17:55.138 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:17:57.410 --> 05:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
we highly recommend that you leave this
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
up to the Native American Commission in
 
05:18:01.730 --> 05:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
the department of natural and cultural
 
05:18:04.490 --> 05:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
resources there's a process already in
 
05:18:06.590 --> 05:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
place the commissioner knows well what's
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
going on and we really this has been
 
05:18:11.690 --> 05:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
this has been at the table at the
 
05:18:13.128 --> 05:18:13.138 align:start position:0%
commission on how to deal with this
 
05:18:16.850 --> 05:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
issue let the indigenous Community have
 
05:18:19.368 --> 05:18:19.378 align:start position:0%
their own voice on this it is not a
 
05:18:20.990 --> 05:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislative matter that you should step
 
05:18:23.208 --> 05:18:23.218 align:start position:0%
into you should be approving whatever we
 
05:18:25.730 --> 05:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
come up with and listen to what we'd
 
05:18:27.890 --> 05:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
come up with don't try to put words in
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
our mouth and say you're speaking for us
 
05:18:32.690 --> 05:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
this is not the way it's done
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
05:18:36.170 --> 05:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
for you we
 
05:18:38.448 --> 05:18:38.458 align:start position:0%
are addressing a New Hampshire statute
 
05:18:42.050 --> 05:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
that establishes this commission and so
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
it is indeed within our purview to
 
05:18:46.970 --> 05:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
change our statute not what the
 
05:18:50.448 --> 05:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
commission does or reports or recommends
 
05:18:53.150 --> 05:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
but the structure of it is in our
 
05:18:56.090 --> 05:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
statutes and we take your advice we
 
05:18:58.070 --> 05:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
agree what
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
we would take your advice on what who
 
05:19:03.350 --> 05:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
should be included but if it's in our
 
05:19:04.610 --> 05:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
law that's
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's our decision we agree um we just
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
think that maintaining the 15-seat
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
current commission outweighs replacing
 
05:19:14.750 --> 05:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
it with a nine-seat commission with four
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
seats specifically I'm sorry five seats
 
05:19:20.330 --> 05:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
specifically devoted to Vermont tribes
 
05:19:22.010 --> 05:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you we just want to maintain
 
05:19:23.810 --> 05:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
inclusion within the state
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right no more questions you're
 
05:19:28.250 --> 05:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
loud and clear all right thank you very
 
05:19:30.830 --> 05:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
much uh please itl this way
 
05:19:40.910 --> 05:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:42.948 --> 05:19:42.958 align:start position:0%

05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
to put it in committee and waste time on
 
05:20:03.948 --> 05:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
hashing things out when you're supposed
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
to come out with something that the
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
people here still do not want
 
05:20:09.650 --> 05:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
people here have something that already
 
05:20:11.990 --> 05:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
Works they don't want to mess with they
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
don't want Outsiders coming in here and
 
05:20:15.948 --> 05:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
trying to tell them how to do things so
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
I think the bill should be itl'd and not
 
05:20:20.090 --> 05:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
waste taxpayer money and your guys's
 
05:20:21.650 --> 05:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
precious time and trying to come up with
 
05:20:22.730 --> 05:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
something that's still not going to be
 
05:20:22.740 --> 05:20:24.288 align:start position:0%
something that's still not going to be
acceptable

05:20:24.288 --> 05:20:24.298 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
05:20:24.298 --> 05:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
acceptable
um

05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
the people who was involved in drawing
 
05:20:30.410 --> 05:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
up the uh the amended version of this
 
05:20:33.350 --> 05:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
um definitely do not have the peoples of
 
05:20:35.990 --> 05:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's best interest at heart
 
05:20:38.510 --> 05:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
please don't impugn their motives they
 
05:20:41.090 --> 05:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
may merely be mistaken or stupid okay
 
05:20:41.100 --> 05:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
may merely be mistaken or stupid okay
well

05:20:42.070 --> 05:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:20:45.590 --> 05:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
I mean you can't say that they're they
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the best interest in part
 
05:20:49.730 --> 05:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
well I don't know their hearts I read
 
05:20:52.010 --> 05:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
what was in the amendment and when we'd
 
05:20:53.690 --> 05:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
go into contract negotiations everybody
 
05:20:56.208 --> 05:20:56.218 align:start position:0%
would say things but what everybody had
 
05:20:57.948 --> 05:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
to live by what was actually wrote down
 
05:20:59.930 --> 05:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
on the contract so people can come in
 
05:21:01.730 --> 05:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
and say one thing but you have to live
 
05:21:04.250 --> 05:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
by what's agreed to in a contract so I
 
05:21:06.350 --> 05:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
read what was in the wording not what
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
people were saying but what was actually
 
05:21:10.430 --> 05:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
worded and the spirit of the people who
 
05:21:13.010 --> 05:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
wrote that are not for the people here
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and they're definitely
 
05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
against Paul and Denise pulio the
 
05:21:20.208 --> 05:21:20.218 align:start position:0%
wording was specifically crafted to
 
05:21:22.070 --> 05:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate them from any future
 
05:21:24.948 --> 05:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
participation in anything going on in
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I don't see how those
 
05:21:27.120 --> 05:21:28.850 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I don't see how those
people

05:21:28.850 --> 05:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:21:30.890 --> 05:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
no matter how much you talk to them are
 
05:21:32.208 --> 05:21:32.218 align:start position:0%
going to change the way they feel about
 
05:21:34.250 --> 05:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
that okay so thank you for that and
 
05:21:37.490 --> 05:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
information so that's all I have to say
 
05:21:39.170 --> 05:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:53.948 --> 05:21:53.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:55.970 --> 05:21:55.980 align:start position:0%

and I understand you're going to retain
 
05:22:14.090 --> 05:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
it study it
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
when you're studying
 
05:22:19.010 --> 05:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
the bill please do your homework pull
 
05:22:21.530 --> 05:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
the curtain back see who's pulling the
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
strings see how they're doing it
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:30.350 --> 05:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
we keep I keep getting referred to as a
 
05:22:31.550 --> 05:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
Vermont Indian
 
05:22:33.590 --> 05:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
well I belong to a promise
 
05:22:35.750 --> 05:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
recognized in the state of Vermont
 
05:22:39.708 --> 05:22:39.718 align:start position:0%
this Ben peesley's in this state
 
05:22:42.288 --> 05:22:42.298 align:start position:0%
since way before it was incorporated
 
05:22:44.750 --> 05:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
the towns that the abunaki trails
 
05:22:47.390 --> 05:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
project has been working in
 
05:22:50.510 --> 05:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
very strong family ties
 
05:22:53.810 --> 05:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
so it's not a bunch of Vermont Indians
 
05:22:56.030 --> 05:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
that are trying to take anything over
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to work for all abernaki
 
05:23:01.610 --> 05:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
and I really hope that you can come up
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
with a process so that all Abenaki can
 
05:23:06.530 --> 05:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
get the opportunity to be recognized if
 
05:23:09.050 --> 05:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's what they so want
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:12.410 --> 05:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:23:15.410 --> 05:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
instructions uh no I don't see any
 
05:23:17.390 --> 05:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that wishes to
 
05:23:20.448 --> 05:23:20.458 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 390
 
05:23:23.150 --> 05:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.400 --> 05:23:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
you we do it differently in the house
 
05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Reverend
 
05:23:47.030 --> 05:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
Zachary Harmon I am a resident of
 
05:23:48.830 --> 05:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
Goffstown and an Episcopal priest
 
05:23:50.750 --> 05:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
serving here in the Episcopal Church of
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you very much
 
05:23:54.590 --> 05:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
honorable chair and honorable
 
05:23:56.750 --> 05:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
representatives for your time I will be
 
05:23:58.250 --> 05:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
very brief
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
and wish to speak uh in regards to HB
 
05:24:04.730 --> 05:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
390 I believe that this seeks to remodel
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Commission on Native
 
05:24:09.288 --> 05:24:09.298 align:start position:0%
American Affairs in a way that is not
 
05:24:11.330 --> 05:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
helpful on the whole
 
05:24:13.070 --> 05:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
um and creates a commission that is more
 
05:24:15.410 --> 05:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
adversarial and less inclusive
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
how does HB 390 create an adversarial
 
05:24:19.788 --> 05:24:19.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Commission on Native
 
05:24:22.550 --> 05:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
American Affairs it gives Vermont state
 
05:24:25.330 --> 05:24:25.340 align:start position:0%
recognized abnaki tribes permanent seats
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't give permanent seats to
 
05:24:29.090 --> 05:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
any other Native American groups with
 
05:24:30.770 --> 05:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
connection to New Hampshire
 
05:24:33.410 --> 05:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
it unbalances the commission and and I
 
05:24:34.550 --> 05:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
believe hurts other Native American
 
05:24:36.890 --> 05:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
groups in the state for instance it does
 
05:24:38.990 --> 05:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
not include the chaosic band of the
 
05:24:41.208 --> 05:24:41.218 align:start position:0%
Penacook Abenaki people who are well
 
05:24:42.830 --> 05:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
known for their educational work in the
 
05:24:45.410 --> 05:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
state I have worked a great deal with
 
05:24:48.650 --> 05:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
them since 2018. I've worked doing
 
05:24:50.930 --> 05:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
educational projects with churches and
 
05:24:52.788 --> 05:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
in the community they have a great deal
 
05:24:55.010 --> 05:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
to share and to teach
 
05:24:56.570 --> 05:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
and Native American presence in
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
connection to New Hampshire I learn
 
05:25:00.170 --> 05:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
every year increasingly is highly
 
05:25:00.180 --> 05:25:01.610 align:start position:0%
every year increasingly is highly
complex

05:25:01.610 --> 05:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
complex
 
05:25:04.550 --> 05:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
I I believe this bill as as written will
 
05:25:06.650 --> 05:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
create more problems in the way that it
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
creates an adversarial structure of
 
05:25:09.708 --> 05:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
haves and have-nots in terms of
 
05:25:12.410 --> 05:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
commission representation
 
05:25:15.590 --> 05:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
HB 390 is also less inclusive I believe
 
05:25:17.930 --> 05:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
for three reasons one reason is that it
 
05:25:20.090 --> 05:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
would create a significantly smaller
 
05:25:22.670 --> 05:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
commission with fewer members and which
 
05:25:24.770 --> 05:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
limits the voices and perspectives of
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
Native Americans in New Hampshire
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
a second reason is it is less inclusive
 
05:25:31.430 --> 05:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
is that it is close to Native Americans
 
05:25:33.230 --> 05:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
who do not have a direct connection to
 
05:25:35.628 --> 05:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
one of the few named institutions in the
 
05:25:35.638 --> 05:25:36.770 align:start position:0%
one of the few named institutions in the
bill

05:25:36.770 --> 05:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:25:39.110 --> 05:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
a third reason that it is less inclusive
 
05:25:41.090 --> 05:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
is that it creates a permanent majority
 
05:25:43.610 --> 05:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
for the abnaki tribes recognized by the
 
05:25:44.930 --> 05:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
thus while other Native Americans are
 
05:25:48.770 --> 05:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
included on the commission their voices
 
05:25:50.690 --> 05:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
and perspectives will be a minority that
 
05:25:52.910 --> 05:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
could easily be voted down
 
05:25:54.890 --> 05:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
this bill takes the current Commission
 
05:25:56.930 --> 05:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
on Native Affairs or Native American
 
05:25:58.910 --> 05:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
Affairs which is relatively open and
 
05:26:01.250 --> 05:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
inclusive and turns it into something
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
adversarial and less inclusive
 
05:26:05.750 --> 05:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I would encourage you
 
05:26:08.750 --> 05:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
to oppose the Bill thank you very much
 
05:26:10.868 --> 05:26:10.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions
 
05:26:15.970 --> 05:26:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:20.208 --> 05:26:20.218 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair had you had
 
05:26:22.670 --> 05:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
occasion to work with the New Hampshire
 
05:26:25.970 --> 05:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
Commission on Native American Affairs I
 
05:26:27.890 --> 05:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
have not worked directly with them but I
 
05:26:29.390 --> 05:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
have used their website to help to
 
05:26:30.890 --> 05:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
understand who to work with in the state
 
05:26:34.868 --> 05:26:34.878 align:start position:0%

and if you could tell me was that
 
05:26:40.010 --> 05:26:40.020 align:start position:0%

05:26:47.150 --> 05:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
be helpful uh because kind of as a
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
church leader in the um with the
 
05:26:51.470 --> 05:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
Episcopal Church uh one of our religious
 
05:26:53.330 --> 05:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
beliefs is that we should work out and
 
05:26:55.850 --> 05:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
and try to restore the damage that's
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
been done with with colonialism and so
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
we're trying to understand who who are
 
05:27:02.090 --> 05:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
the different Native American groups in
 
05:27:03.470 --> 05:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and who should we reach
 
05:27:05.150 --> 05:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
out to uh to try and restore
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
relationships and so that that list
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
instead of Connections in that Network I
 
05:27:12.050 --> 05:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
I found to be helpful thank you just one
 
05:27:13.490 --> 05:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
more thing
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
um in your work uh with them although
 
05:27:18.770 --> 05:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
it's not been directed have you um had
 
05:27:22.430 --> 05:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
any reason to consider the possibility
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
that the structure the organization
 
05:27:27.590 --> 05:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
should be changed in order for it to
 
05:27:29.990 --> 05:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
better meet its stated goals and
 
05:27:30.000 --> 05:27:31.310 align:start position:0%
better meet its stated goals and
objectives

05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
objectives
 
05:27:34.128 --> 05:27:34.138 align:start position:0%
I I haven't had any occasion to really
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
deeply wonder that I would say thank you
 
05:27:40.490 --> 05:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:43.490 --> 05:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:27:45.350 --> 05:27:45.360 align:start position:0%

05:27:48.170 --> 05:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on House Bill 390
 
05:27:48.180 --> 05:27:50.410 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on House Bill 390
foreign

foreign
 
05:27:54.890 --> 05:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:54.900 --> 05:27:56.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:27:56.990 --> 05:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:27:58.430 --> 05:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
you have a motion
 
05:27:58.440 --> 05:27:59.628 align:start position:0%
you have a motion
yes

05:27:59.628 --> 05:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:28:02.390 --> 05:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I will make the motion and I motion
 
05:28:05.090 --> 05:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
itl on House Bill 390.
 
05:28:09.410 --> 05:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
by representative Schmidt okay do you
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your motion I do so
 
05:28:17.390 --> 05:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
when a committee retains a bill it is
 
05:28:20.810 --> 05:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
with the idea that there is
 
05:28:20.820 --> 05:28:22.970 align:start position:0%
with the idea that there is
um

05:28:22.970 --> 05:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:25.788 --> 05:28:25.798 align:start position:0%
a remedy for the bill
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
and that this the action that the
 
05:28:30.670 --> 05:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee would make afterwards would be
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation or
 
05:28:35.330 --> 05:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
not recommended for further legislation
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
that's as far as what a retain Bill does
 
05:28:40.970 --> 05:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
well no
 
05:28:42.830 --> 05:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's interim study oh sorry sorry
 
05:28:45.170 --> 05:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
sorry this year we can actually amend
 
05:28:47.208 --> 05:28:47.218 align:start position:0%
the bills we'll try to pass it
 
05:28:49.628 --> 05:28:49.638 align:start position:0%
so let me take that back but my my
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:57.010 --> 05:28:57.020 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that there's just too much
 
05:29:01.610 --> 05:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding on the part of
 
05:29:05.090 --> 05:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
on our part and and possibly the part on
 
05:29:05.100 --> 05:29:06.230 align:start position:0%
on our part and and possibly the part on
the

05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:09.530 --> 05:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
and those involved
 
05:29:14.208 --> 05:29:14.218 align:start position:0%
and I'm particularly saddened because we
 
05:29:17.330 --> 05:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
as a committee get along very well and
 
05:29:19.368 --> 05:29:19.378 align:start position:0%
we have quite opposing views
 
05:29:21.230 --> 05:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm saddened that that isn't
 
05:29:23.030 --> 05:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
happening and I'm particularly saddened
 
05:29:25.910 --> 05:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
that any member that would testify
 
05:29:27.530 --> 05:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
before us who had made disparaging
 
05:29:29.330 --> 05:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
comments about a member of our own
 
05:29:32.690 --> 05:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
committee that is hurtful to me
 
05:29:32.700 --> 05:29:33.470 align:start position:0%
committee that is hurtful to me
um

05:29:33.470 --> 05:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:35.390 --> 05:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
so I want to
 
05:29:35.400 --> 05:29:36.170 align:start position:0%
so I want to
um

05:29:36.170 --> 05:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
recommend that we don't entertain this
 
05:29:41.810 --> 05:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
bill and that we move on to something
 
05:29:41.820 --> 05:29:42.830 align:start position:0%
bill and that we move on to something
else

05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
else
 
05:29:45.110 --> 05:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
if there is such a thing thank you
 
05:29:45.120 --> 05:29:48.050 align:start position:0%
if there is such a thing thank you
representative

05:29:48.050 --> 05:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:50.350 --> 05:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
I've already casually
 
05:29:53.170 --> 05:29:53.180 align:start position:0%
indicated in my some of my questions
 
05:29:55.730 --> 05:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
that I think that we are getting into
 
05:29:57.948 --> 05:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
very dangerous Waters here
 
05:30:01.368 --> 05:30:01.378 align:start position:0%
I I have a hard time imagining that this
 
05:30:01.378 --> 05:30:02.470 align:start position:0%
I I have a hard time imagining that this
committee

05:30:02.470 --> 05:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:30:07.070 --> 05:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh which has next to no experience is
 
05:30:09.050 --> 05:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
going to be kind of sitting in judgment
 
05:30:12.350 --> 05:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
about the commission on Native American
 
05:30:15.830 --> 05:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
Affairs which already exists it's part
 
05:30:18.890 --> 05:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
of our law it's a structure that has
 
05:30:21.050 --> 05:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
existed for some time
 
05:30:24.830 --> 05:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
by the testimony that we've heard it's a
 
05:30:26.390 --> 05:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
functioning Commission
 
05:30:29.868 --> 05:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
the letter from Ann Jenison which I have
 
05:30:32.750 --> 05:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
not even had a chance to read but she is
 
05:30:34.550 --> 05:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:41.090 --> 05:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
so the idea that we I'm going to call us
 
05:30:44.470 --> 05:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:47.330 --> 05:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
Caucasians and so forth are going to be
 
05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
sitting in Judgment of of something
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
about which we know nothing but we're
 
05:30:54.948 --> 05:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
going to have a we're going to take this
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill up and study it in a retained form
 
05:30:57.360 --> 05:30:59.930 align:start position:0%
bill up and study it in a retained form
I

05:30:59.930 --> 05:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:31:03.890 --> 05:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
I I think this is extremely risky for us
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
to get into something I think that Paul
 
05:31:10.788 --> 05:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
pulio Chief Paul pulio
 
05:31:13.190 --> 05:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
um indicated already
 
05:31:16.090 --> 05:31:16.100 align:start position:0%
that we are going to need expert
 
05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
witnesses to be able to help us
 
05:31:21.770 --> 05:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
make some kind of a judgment about
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
something we know nothing or next to
 
05:31:26.390 --> 05:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
nothing about
 
05:31:29.390 --> 05:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
I can't see that this is any I mean we
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
have expertise in this committee already
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
even the new people already have
 
05:31:36.770 --> 05:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
expertise this is not an area in which I
 
05:31:39.770 --> 05:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
think we should get involved
 
05:31:42.288 --> 05:31:42.298 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yes representative
 
05:31:42.298 --> 05:31:48.830 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yes representative
Smith

05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:52.190 --> 05:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
Madam chair it is with the sadness that
 
05:31:52.200 --> 05:31:53.390 align:start position:0%
Madam chair it is with the sadness that
I

05:31:53.390 --> 05:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:31:55.550 --> 05:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
want to speak
 
05:32:00.650 --> 05:32:00.660 align:start position:0%
um of my distress at the statement made
 
05:32:03.770 --> 05:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
by my very distinguished and experienced
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
colleague from Dover
 
05:32:08.750 --> 05:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think the fact that the
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee is white or not
 
05:32:15.470 --> 05:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
has anything at all to do with this
 
05:32:18.890 --> 05:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
issue I don't think that in order to
 
05:32:23.030 --> 05:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
address the problems of the poor one has
 
05:32:25.550 --> 05:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
to be poor I don't think that in order
 
05:32:29.448 --> 05:32:29.458 align:start position:0%
to address the problems of the sick you
 
05:32:31.788 --> 05:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
have to be sick and I don't think in
 
05:32:36.190 --> 05:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
order to address the problems of
 
05:32:39.530 --> 05:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
the the indigenous peoples in this state
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
one has to be a member of a recognized
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
indigenous tribe what I do think is that
 
05:32:52.690 --> 05:32:52.700 align:start position:0%
nothing has been presented to us so far
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
that would indicate that the statute
 
05:32:56.400 --> 05:32:58.810 align:start position:0%
that would indicate that the statute
statutorily

05:32:58.810 --> 05:32:58.820 align:start position:0%
statutorily
 
05:33:01.850 --> 05:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
created New Hampshire Commission on
 
05:33:04.850 --> 05:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
Native American Affairs is not working
 
05:33:08.750 --> 05:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the way that the legislature intended
 
05:33:11.390 --> 05:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
it to work when it was created a number
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
of years ago and therefore it seems to
 
05:33:18.288 --> 05:33:18.298 align:start position:0%
me that
 
05:33:21.050 --> 05:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
we as legislators
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
ought to let the executive branch carry
 
05:33:27.770 --> 05:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
out its responsibilities as they have
 
05:33:31.070 --> 05:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
been directed to do and it is on that
 
05:33:35.270 --> 05:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
basis not on the basis of our color our
 
05:33:39.050 --> 05:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
religion our gender that I would say
 
05:33:41.810 --> 05:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
that it isn't there is no reason that's
 
05:33:44.090 --> 05:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
been presented to us today that would
 
05:33:47.350 --> 05:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
indicate that we should
 
05:33:49.850 --> 05:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
take action in support of this Bill
 
05:33:51.170 --> 05:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:53.390 --> 05:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
05:33:55.970 --> 05:33:55.980 align:start position:0%

second the comments of Representative
 
05:34:00.650 --> 05:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
Smith the other thing is if we I tell it
 
05:34:02.448 --> 05:34:02.458 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean something
 
05:34:04.610 --> 05:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
can't be done in the future in this
 
05:34:05.930 --> 05:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
regard if
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know the effort goes into trying to
 
05:34:09.410 --> 05:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
sort out what's the best thing to do if
 
05:34:11.810 --> 05:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
the current commission isn't working as
 
05:34:12.708 --> 05:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
it should
 
05:34:16.010 --> 05:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
yes represent Gould
 
05:34:18.110 --> 05:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair perhaps I
 
05:34:20.810 --> 05:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
misunderstood I I thought um the request
 
05:34:23.330 --> 05:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
was to keep the testimony very brief
 
05:34:24.890 --> 05:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
because we were going to retain the bill
 
05:34:29.208 --> 05:34:29.218 align:start position:0%
uh we tried okay so
 
05:34:29.218 --> 05:34:30.288 align:start position:0%
uh we tried okay so
um

05:34:30.288 --> 05:34:30.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:33.250 --> 05:34:33.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to say that first of all
 
05:34:35.830 --> 05:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 14
 
05:34:39.410 --> 05:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
1A I believe it is the uh the end of the
 
05:34:39.420 --> 05:34:40.490 align:start position:0%
1A I believe it is the uh the end of the
current

05:34:40.490 --> 05:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:34:43.670 --> 05:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
law that authorizes the commission on
 
05:34:45.948 --> 05:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
Native Affairs clearly states that the
 
05:34:47.570 --> 05:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
commission on Native Affairs is
 
05:34:50.510 --> 05:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited from recognizing Abenaki
 
05:34:52.190 --> 05:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
tribes and that only the general court
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
has the authority to do that
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
so that was the reason for the study
 
05:34:59.208 --> 05:34:59.218 align:start position:0%
committee is to help educate this group
 
05:35:00.890 --> 05:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
not that they're experts in Native
 
05:35:03.410 --> 05:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
Americans but you alone have the
 
05:35:06.890 --> 05:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority Under federal law to
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
understand and know your rights and
 
05:35:10.970 --> 05:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to recognize or not
 
05:35:13.208 --> 05:35:13.218 align:start position:0%
Native American tribes in New Hampshire
 
05:35:16.010 --> 05:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
and so that is what we would be studying
 
05:35:20.150 --> 05:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
and that um the problems with the
 
05:35:23.030 --> 05:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
commission historically had to do with
 
05:35:25.730 --> 05:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
the number of people that they needed to
 
05:35:26.930 --> 05:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
make a quorum and I know they still
 
05:35:28.250 --> 05:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
struggle a little bit with that but I
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
know that they got a lot of appointments
 
05:35:31.788 --> 05:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
made to the commission
 
05:35:34.368 --> 05:35:34.378 align:start position:0%
the kind of statements that have been
 
05:35:38.208 --> 05:35:38.218 align:start position:0%
made in this hearing aren't
 
05:35:38.218 --> 05:35:38.868 align:start position:0%
made in this hearing aren't
um

05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:40.610 --> 05:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
aren't at all what we would be looking
 
05:35:43.070 --> 05:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
at in a study would be looking at
 
05:35:45.170 --> 05:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
federal law what is federal recognition
 
05:35:48.650 --> 05:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
what is State recognition uh what is the
 
05:35:51.650 --> 05:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
states the general Court's legal
 
05:35:53.750 --> 05:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
authority to recognize State tribes and
 
05:35:56.690 --> 05:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
however the states handled that and what
 
05:35:58.490 --> 05:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
would be needed on the commission like
 
05:36:02.090 --> 05:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
the legislative authority to do so so I
 
05:36:04.128 --> 05:36:04.138 align:start position:0%
would strongly request that the
 
05:36:07.788 --> 05:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
committee not itls bill but retain it so
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
that we can get educated and know only
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
you can do this nobody else can do this
 
05:36:15.948 --> 05:36:15.958 align:start position:0%
only the general court can do this and
 
05:36:17.930 --> 05:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
this is the committee that handles this
 
05:36:19.850 --> 05:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
for the general court at this stage
 
05:36:21.970 --> 05:36:21.980 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bill and
 
05:36:26.570 --> 05:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to say
 
05:36:26.580 --> 05:36:27.708 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to say
that

05:36:27.708 --> 05:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:27.718 --> 05:36:29.330 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:36:29.330 --> 05:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:31.550 --> 05:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
I I think it's
 
05:36:34.128 --> 05:36:34.138 align:start position:0%
should be obvious to us that
 
05:36:34.138 --> 05:36:36.948 align:start position:0%
should be obvious to us that
race

05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
a race as a member of this committee
 
05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
does not invalidate my opinion on this
 
05:36:44.690 --> 05:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
legislation or anyone else's for that
 
05:36:44.700 --> 05:36:45.830 align:start position:0%
legislation or anyone else's for that
matter

05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
matter
 
05:36:49.010 --> 05:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I I'd like to comment
 
05:36:53.050 --> 05:36:53.060 align:start position:0%
that yes it may be our responsibility
 
05:36:56.570 --> 05:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
to approve State recognition if some
 
05:37:00.310 --> 05:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
were to be requested but I think that
 
05:37:03.650 --> 05:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
absent a recommendation from a group
 
05:37:06.650 --> 05:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
that is looking for State recognition or
 
05:37:09.470 --> 05:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
a blanket policy from the commission on
 
05:37:12.410 --> 05:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
Native American Affairs we shouldn't be
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
initiating the process for State
 
05:37:15.120 --> 05:37:17.208 align:start position:0%
initiating the process for State
recognition

05:37:17.208 --> 05:37:17.218 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
as other people have said you know we
 
05:37:22.250 --> 05:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
have a commission that's working on it
 
05:37:24.770 --> 05:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
if they choose to make a recommendation
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
to us that we need State recognition for
 
05:37:31.610 --> 05:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
this that or the other group then we
 
05:37:35.150 --> 05:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
will consider it but I don't think we
 
05:37:38.470 --> 05:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:47.810 --> 05:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
right anyone else representative Gerhard
 
05:37:47.820 --> 05:37:48.948 align:start position:0%
right anyone else representative Gerhard
I

05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:37:51.110 --> 05:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
I just don't see what the problem is
 
05:37:52.610 --> 05:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
with the current commission I just was
 
05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
never able to ascertain the issue so I
 
05:37:58.128 --> 05:37:58.138 align:start position:0%
will also support the itl thank you
 
05:37:59.990 --> 05:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:38:02.570 --> 05:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
represents like us yeah I'm in a bit of
 
05:38:05.510 --> 05:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
a quandary I mean if if there is a
 
05:38:08.270 --> 05:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
problem and there is a need for
 
05:38:10.128 --> 05:38:10.138 align:start position:0%
some change
 
05:38:13.670 --> 05:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know learning more about it and you
 
05:38:15.530 --> 05:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
know figuring that out might make sense
 
05:38:17.090 --> 05:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
you know retain might make sense for
 
05:38:17.100 --> 05:38:17.868 align:start position:0%
you know retain might make sense for
that

05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:17.878 --> 05:38:19.190 align:start position:0%
that
but

05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:38:22.310 --> 05:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I mean maybe the best thing would be
 
05:38:22.320 --> 05:38:23.930 align:start position:0%
um I mean maybe the best thing would be
for

05:38:23.930 --> 05:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:38:26.570 --> 05:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
you know some activity to occur to look
 
05:38:28.250 --> 05:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
into this and come up with a specific
 
05:38:28.260 --> 05:38:29.868 align:start position:0%
into this and come up with a specific
proposal

05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
05:38:32.208 --> 05:38:32.218 align:start position:0%
for us to consider in the future at this
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:34.798 --> 05:38:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

05:38:36.110 --> 05:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:38:39.230 --> 05:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
yeah anyone else
 
05:38:41.690 --> 05:38:41.700 align:start position:0%

05:39:59.750 --> 05:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
he came in after you gaveled yeah I was
 
05:40:01.910 --> 05:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
here for the second to be perfectly
 
05:40:07.430 --> 05:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
honest so I was a little tidy okay may I
 
05:40:09.708 --> 05:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
make a comment
 
05:40:11.990 --> 05:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to rep um issue a
 
05:40:13.810 --> 05:40:13.820 align:start position:0%
representative ghoul that just because
 
05:40:16.010 --> 05:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
we don't have a steady committee it
 
05:40:18.770 --> 05:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you can't form one
 
05:40:21.110 --> 05:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
right she can she can certainly bring
 
05:40:24.050 --> 05:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
other people in on this idea
 
05:40:28.070 --> 05:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.050 --> 05:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
um for the legislation on her own she
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't need us to form what she wants
 
05:40:34.490 --> 05:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:40:37.490 --> 05:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely in any event the motion
 
05:40:40.610 --> 05:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
passes and experience to legislate 16-3
 
05:40:45.650 --> 05:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:47.510 --> 05:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
and let
 
05:40:49.610 --> 05:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
does anyone want to write a Minority
 
05:40:49.620 --> 05:40:52.610 align:start position:0%
does anyone want to write a Minority
Report

05:40:52.610 --> 05:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:56.390 --> 05:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
no okay all right representative Broda a
 
05:41:00.590 --> 05:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:02.510 --> 05:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not making any more emotions today
 
05:41:05.570 --> 05:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
by the way by the way committee yes all
 
05:41:05.580 --> 05:41:07.910 align:start position:0%
by the way by the way committee yes all
right

05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:07.920 --> 05:41:08.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:41:08.810 --> 05:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:11.470 --> 05:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
fine in that case
 
05:41:14.930 --> 05:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
hcr2 on condemning vandalism does anyone
 
05:41:22.010 --> 05:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:25.390 --> 05:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
I didn't quite get that Imam sure hcr2
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
condemning vandalism I just want to
 
05:41:30.230 --> 05:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
remind representative Gould that was one
 
05:41:32.750 --> 05:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why we waited until now
 
05:41:32.760 --> 05:41:34.670 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why we waited until now
to

05:41:34.670 --> 05:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:41:34.680 --> 05:41:36.948 align:start position:0%
to
um

05:41:36.948 --> 05:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:39.770 --> 05:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
vote on these bills because she was
 
05:41:43.550 --> 05:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:43.560 --> 05:41:46.010 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:41:46.010 --> 05:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:41:46.020 --> 05:41:49.550 align:start position:0%
representative
police

05:41:49.550 --> 05:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'd like to make a
 
05:41:56.868 --> 05:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
motion to itlhcr2
 
05:41:58.730 --> 05:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:04.788 --> 05:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
do we should speak to your motion I
 
05:42:06.050 --> 05:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to my motion thank
 
05:42:08.510 --> 05:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair the reason why I feel
 
05:42:11.170 --> 05:42:11.180 align:start position:0%
that we should itl is
 
05:42:17.150 --> 05:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
that the wording in the resolution is in
 
05:42:19.850 --> 05:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
the past tense I don't think that this
 
05:42:21.770 --> 05:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
bill is where it really needs to be to
 
05:42:23.750 --> 05:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
05:42:25.128 --> 05:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
05:42:25.138 --> 05:42:28.250 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
Gerhart

05:42:28.250 --> 05:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:30.470 --> 05:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
I agree okay
 
05:42:33.650 --> 05:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Schmidt
 
05:42:37.030 --> 05:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
I I think we need to
 
05:42:38.990 --> 05:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
examine this
 
05:42:41.810 --> 05:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
in terms of the actual language there's
 
05:42:45.230 --> 05:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
one or two references to past tense of I
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
of actions or events that actually
 
05:42:52.010 --> 05:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:54.948 --> 05:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
okay some of the hate some of the hate
 
05:42:58.490 --> 05:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
events or whatever did occur in the past
 
05:43:02.410 --> 05:43:02.420 align:start position:0%
but otherwise it says is incumbent
 
05:43:04.610 --> 05:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
stands United
 
05:43:04.620 --> 05:43:06.410 align:start position:0%
stands United

05:43:06.420 --> 05:43:08.448 align:start position:0%
Rejects
condemns

05:43:08.448 --> 05:43:08.458 align:start position:0%
condemns
 
05:43:11.750 --> 05:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
investigate calls on oh these are all
 
05:43:14.270 --> 05:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
present tense these are our future
 
05:43:18.170 --> 05:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
intents this is a misunderstanding of
 
05:43:18.180 --> 05:43:19.670 align:start position:0%
intents this is a misunderstanding of
the

05:43:19.670 --> 05:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:43:21.708 --> 05:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
question of the present tense or past
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
tense okay this is a mystery I'm sorry
 
05:43:27.350 --> 05:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
representing but this is a misreading of
 
05:43:30.530 --> 05:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
the your emotion stands but I will not
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
now the only thing I'll support the itl
 
05:43:40.970 --> 05:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
um maybe not for that reason I haven't
 
05:43:43.430 --> 05:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
looked through it again carefully as far
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
as the tents and all that but um I mean
 
05:43:48.048 --> 05:43:48.058 align:start position:0%
the the legislature's already spoken
 
05:43:51.410 --> 05:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
these kind of crimes are their crimes
 
05:43:52.970 --> 05:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
um and that statement stands and I don't
 
05:43:56.330 --> 05:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:56.340 --> 05:44:00.288 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:44:00.288 --> 05:44:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:02.448 --> 05:44:02.458 align:start position:0%
worry about some of these terms that
 
05:44:03.890 --> 05:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
have gotten more and more popular
 
05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
including hate speech and things like
 
05:44:09.530 --> 05:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
that it freedom of speech is just so
 
05:44:11.868 --> 05:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
fundamental to the whole way our society
 
05:44:13.970 --> 05:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
functions and that when we start saying
 
05:44:15.770 --> 05:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
oh that's hateful that's not let's just
 
05:44:17.330 --> 05:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
get everything out people say what they
 
05:44:18.708 --> 05:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
got to say there'll be no they'll be
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
less violence because people now have
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
expressed themselves now as far as
 
05:44:23.570 --> 05:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
vandalism no that's stupid it's already
 
05:44:25.368 --> 05:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
against the law like Tony uh Mr
 
05:44:26.810 --> 05:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative like I was just saying
 
05:44:29.810 --> 05:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
but and also I get a little worried
 
05:44:29.820 --> 05:44:30.890 align:start position:0%
but and also I get a little worried
about

05:44:30.890 --> 05:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:44:33.650 --> 05:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
the classification of group rights
 
05:44:35.330 --> 05:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
individual rights I think is where we
 
05:44:37.368 --> 05:44:37.378 align:start position:0%
need to focus if you assault somebody
 
05:44:39.530 --> 05:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's assault on somebody
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
and that's the crime itself just because
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
you belong to this protected class I
 
05:44:44.750 --> 05:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
just think it creates animosity and
 
05:44:47.930 --> 05:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
unneeded undo burdens burdens on law
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement filling out a million
 
05:44:50.990 --> 05:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
different reports it's just if somebody
 
05:44:52.730 --> 05:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
commits a crime let's prosecute it and
 
05:44:56.690 --> 05:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
keep it moving thank you anyone else
 
05:44:58.610 --> 05:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that I agree with
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard and Lucas that
 
05:45:05.810 --> 05:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
these items are primes already we can't
 
05:45:08.330 --> 05:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
I don't see the point of us putting up a
 
05:45:11.448 --> 05:45:11.458 align:start position:0%
resolution saying don't commit crimes we
 
05:45:14.090 --> 05:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
we abhor people who would who commit
 
05:45:14.100 --> 05:45:15.350 align:start position:0%
we abhor people who would who commit
crimes

05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
05:45:17.810 --> 05:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm also concerned that it's a
 
05:45:20.390 --> 05:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution and it's
 
05:45:23.690 --> 05:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
it's going to die if the Senate will not
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
accept it so I think it's
 
05:45:31.128 --> 05:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
a well-meaning but rather feudal gesture
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
in my opinion well
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
represent baber
 
05:45:42.410 --> 05:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
I think it's just a technical question I
 
05:45:43.730 --> 05:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
know my motion
 
05:45:46.250 --> 05:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
um my committee report is due today I
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
need it can I have it to you by 9 pm yes
 
05:45:53.330 --> 05:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
assuming that you're responsible for it

05:45:59.930 --> 05:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
but anyway so the motion is an
 
05:46:03.708 --> 05:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
experience to legislate on hcr2 by
 
05:46:05.390 --> 05:46:05.400 align:start position:0%

05:47:17.510 --> 05:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
just 13-7 I don't think that's a consent
 
05:47:19.970 --> 05:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
type of vote
 
05:47:21.890 --> 05:47:21.900 align:start position:0%

chair uh this is kind of old hat old
 
05:48:15.470 --> 05:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
news for the city of Nashville we are a
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
welcoming Community I totally agree
 
05:48:21.708 --> 05:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have things to come across
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
our desk whether you know
 
05:48:24.958 --> 05:48:26.090 align:start position:0%
our desk whether you know
uh

05:48:26.090 --> 05:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:48:29.208 --> 05:48:29.218 align:start position:0%
do we want to support it or not you know
 
05:48:31.670 --> 05:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
is it already codified into law or
 
05:48:34.128 --> 05:48:34.138 align:start position:0%
something like that but the way I look
 
05:48:38.690 --> 05:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
at House Bill uh excuse me HR 11.
 
05:48:43.430 --> 05:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
resolution HR 11 is this is a branding
 
05:48:47.090 --> 05:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
issue okay it should counter in a way be
 
05:48:49.788 --> 05:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
almost like a no-brainer I think most of
 
05:48:52.570 --> 05:48:52.580 align:start position:0%
us in our communities do welcome people
 
05:48:55.730 --> 05:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
uh we appreciate the businesses that the
 
05:48:57.890 --> 05:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
good people of Massachusetts like coming
 
05:49:01.128 --> 05:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
from Nashua that do come up and spend
 
05:49:02.990 --> 05:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
money at the you know the Pheasant Lane
 
05:49:06.530 --> 05:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
Mall or other type of places those of us
 
05:49:08.150 --> 05:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
who live farther up in the north
 
05:49:10.970 --> 05:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
probably do appreciate the vacations
 
05:49:14.090 --> 05:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
that come up these skiers and everything
 
05:49:18.048 --> 05:49:18.058 align:start position:0%
else and if we think solely and strictly
 
05:49:21.410 --> 05:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
just on the statement of branding why
 
05:49:25.368 --> 05:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
not you know in other words that a whole
 
05:49:28.368 --> 05:49:28.378 align:start position:0%
state should be a welcoming Community to
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
all come in you know you want them to
 
05:49:33.350 --> 05:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
open up their wallet or make them feel
 
05:49:35.930 --> 05:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
welcomed when they're doing so you know
 
05:49:39.010 --> 05:49:39.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to urge you to use uh
 
05:49:42.110 --> 05:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
please stand with me in support of our
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
resolution number 11. thank you thank
 
05:49:47.208 --> 05:49:47.218 align:start position:0%
you professor
 
05:49:51.490 --> 05:49:51.500 align:start position:0%
I so enjoyed that I don't dare add to it
 
05:49:53.990 --> 05:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
Ah that's very respectful of you other
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have a comment
 
05:49:57.830 --> 05:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative gerhardt thank you madam
 
05:50:00.230 --> 05:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
chair I do think that we need I agree
 
05:50:01.850 --> 05:50:01.860 align:start position:0%
with representative O'Brien I do think
 
05:50:03.650 --> 05:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
we need to welcome people especially
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
those who are trying to spend money up
 
05:50:08.930 --> 05:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
here but I think we do that via our laws
 
05:50:10.670 --> 05:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
that make us the freest in the Northeast
 
05:50:14.030 --> 05:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's well established that's why people
 
05:50:15.890 --> 05:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
come up here's low taxes and everything
 
05:50:19.670 --> 05:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
else and the liquor stores so I I'm not
 
05:50:22.310 --> 05:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
so sure that this would really I mean is
 
05:50:23.448 --> 05:50:23.458 align:start position:0%
somebody really going to be looking at a
 
05:50:24.770 --> 05:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
vacation plan going Vermont New
 
05:50:25.788 --> 05:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oh they're a welcoming
 
05:50:27.350 --> 05:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
Community I just I don't I don't see
 
05:50:28.788 --> 05:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
that going into the
 
05:50:30.548 --> 05:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:50:33.948 --> 05:50:33.958 align:start position:0%
decision so I I just find this kind of
 
05:50:35.330 --> 05:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
one of those feel-good things which
 
05:50:37.010 --> 05:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
makes sense but I think the way you
 
05:50:38.690 --> 05:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
really welcome people is you lift
 
05:50:41.150 --> 05:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's boat up and there's more
 
05:50:43.070 --> 05:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
businesses for them to come frequently
 
05:50:45.770 --> 05:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
so I'd just say that thank you all right
 
05:50:47.770 --> 05:50:47.780 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone else have a comment
 
05:50:50.390 --> 05:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
05:50:52.850 --> 05:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:50:55.070 --> 05:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
I sort of feel like I should be saying
 
05:50:57.948 --> 05:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
yes to OTP but there's a lot of me
 
05:51:00.530 --> 05:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
that's screaming no
 
05:51:00.540 --> 05:51:01.910 align:start position:0%
that's screaming no
um

05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:04.390 --> 05:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
I am against
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
codifying days
 
05:51:09.770 --> 05:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
into statute
 
05:51:09.780 --> 05:51:10.368 align:start position:0%
into statute
um

05:51:10.368 --> 05:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:14.090 --> 05:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
so putting a month into statute I I
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
could be 30 or 31 times even more
 
05:51:17.628 --> 05:51:17.638 align:start position:0%
against that
 
05:51:19.970 --> 05:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
actually representative true this is not
 
05:51:22.910 --> 05:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
put it into statute it's just a uh a
 
05:51:24.350 --> 05:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
session law
 
05:51:26.208 --> 05:51:26.218 align:start position:0%
which means it'll be impossible to find
 
05:51:28.788 --> 05:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
05:51:32.208 --> 05:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
that makes me feel a little bit better
 
05:51:33.948 --> 05:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
05:51:38.330 --> 05:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
um but but the idea that uh we we're
 
05:51:40.850 --> 05:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
gonna say the state should urge small
 
05:51:43.010 --> 05:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
businesses to do this
 
05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
or do that or don't do this or don't do
 
05:51:45.840 --> 05:51:47.810 align:start position:0%
or do that or don't do this or don't do
that

05:51:47.810 --> 05:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
whether you're welcoming or not uh I'm
 
05:51:54.610 --> 05:51:54.620 align:start position:0%
against the uh
 
05:51:56.750 --> 05:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Aber
 
05:52:02.270 --> 05:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Second representative true's
 
05:52:04.250 --> 05:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
comments thank you okay
 
05:52:07.128 --> 05:52:07.138 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:52:08.810 --> 05:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
05:52:10.670 --> 05:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair these are always
 
05:52:12.530 --> 05:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
tricky ones to handle and I feel like we
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
handle these kinds of things a lot
 
05:52:13.920 --> 05:52:15.650 align:start position:0%
handle these kinds of things a lot
obviously

05:52:15.650 --> 05:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
05:52:15.660 --> 05:52:16.190 align:start position:0%
obviously
um

05:52:16.190 --> 05:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:18.890 --> 05:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
I at least for myself welcoming
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
communities the concept of it is
 
05:52:23.930 --> 05:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
something that I support very strongly
 
05:52:25.610 --> 05:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
um but when we start getting into the
 
05:52:28.910 --> 05:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
language of urging our constituents
 
05:52:30.830 --> 05:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
um with you know with the authority that
 
05:52:32.270 --> 05:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
we have even though yes this is a
 
05:52:33.410 --> 05:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
resolution we frequently talk about
 
05:52:35.030 --> 05:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
resolutions getting lost because they do
 
05:52:38.330 --> 05:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
and they might not be seen very often
 
05:52:40.250 --> 05:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult to qualify what
 
05:52:42.830 --> 05:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
welcoming means because it's frequently
 
05:52:44.930 --> 05:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
in the eye of the person receiving the
 
05:52:47.510 --> 05:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
gesture and that can be very different
 
05:52:51.048 --> 05:52:51.058 align:start position:0%
to different people and being able to
 
05:52:53.690 --> 05:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
adequately come to a consensus on what
 
05:52:55.430 --> 05:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
that might look like could be difficult
 
05:52:57.288 --> 05:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
something that's welcoming to one person
 
05:52:59.690 --> 05:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
can be offensive to another I find that
 
05:53:01.330 --> 05:53:01.340 align:start position:0%
to be a difficult thing to balance
 
05:53:03.830 --> 05:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's primarily the reason why I'm not
 
05:53:05.150 --> 05:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
going to support the house resolution
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
although obviously I wasn't here this
 
05:53:08.868 --> 05:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
morning but I did listen
 
05:53:11.150 --> 05:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
um remotely and uh representative
 
05:53:12.890 --> 05:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
mangaputi I appreciate you bringing it
 
05:53:14.390 --> 05:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
05:53:14.400 --> 05:53:16.368 align:start position:0%
forward and
um

05:53:16.368 --> 05:53:16.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:18.830 --> 05:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
and the concept of it I'm very much in
 
05:53:20.510 --> 05:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
support of
 
05:53:22.730 --> 05:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
anyone else represents
 
05:53:25.730 --> 05:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
oh thank you I agree with uh what
 
05:53:28.970 --> 05:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
representative Simon said in addition
 
05:53:30.708 --> 05:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm just not comfortable doing things
 
05:53:32.990 --> 05:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
that in effect have no they don't do
 
05:53:34.788 --> 05:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
anything they don't have any real
 
05:53:37.430 --> 05:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
consequential action like the other
 
05:53:39.350 --> 05:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
special days I know this is a resolution
 
05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
on a day but it's similar in that
 
05:53:41.040 --> 05:53:44.390 align:start position:0%
on a day but it's similar in that
respect

05:53:44.390 --> 05:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:46.850 --> 05:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:53:49.190 --> 05:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
not seeing anybody in that case the
 
05:53:50.990 --> 05:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass by
 
05:53:52.730 --> 05:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien and the court
 
05:53:54.288 --> 05:53:54.298 align:start position:0%
called the rule
 
05:53:57.128 --> 05:53:57.138 align:start position:0%
representative Simon no Representative
 
05:54:00.310 --> 05:54:00.320 align:start position:0%

06:01:24.610 --> 06:01:24.620 align:start position:0%
the general Corps as a whole through
 
06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
various statutes and other declarations
 
06:01:31.250 --> 06:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
has made the decision the policy
 
06:01:34.610 --> 06:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
decision that licensure really should
 
06:01:36.770 --> 06:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
only be instituted to protect the public
 
06:01:38.990 --> 06:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's the only legitimate reason for
 
06:01:39.000 --> 06:01:40.850 align:start position:0%
that's the only legitimate reason for
licensure

06:01:40.850 --> 06:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
06:01:42.770 --> 06:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
um there are certainly other reasons why
 
06:01:44.750 --> 06:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
we license individuals and we can't
 
06:01:46.548 --> 06:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
resolve the insurance reimbursement
 
06:01:51.048 --> 06:01:51.058 align:start position:0%
issue at present but the only true basis
 
06:01:54.368 --> 06:01:54.378 align:start position:0%
for licensure is to protect the public
 
06:01:58.490 --> 06:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that uh there are
 
06:02:00.830 --> 06:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
other less restrictive means of
 
06:02:04.250 --> 06:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
protecting the public this legislature
 
06:02:07.730 --> 06:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
has chosen not to regulate in those
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
areas so I think the governor's proposal
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
is intended to be consistent with the
 
06:02:14.510 --> 06:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
prior policy Declarations of the
 
06:02:17.208 --> 06:02:17.218 align:start position:0%
legislature I think you've probably seen
 
06:02:19.910 --> 06:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the press release that that we issued
 
06:02:23.948 --> 06:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
outlining what HB proposes to do
 
06:02:26.448 --> 06:02:26.458 align:start position:0%
but in a nutshell it establishes
 
06:02:28.970 --> 06:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
Universal licensure recognition it
 
06:02:30.530 --> 06:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
transfers certain boards to the office
 
06:02:33.288 --> 06:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
merges certain boards eliminates certain
 
06:02:35.750 --> 06:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
license types and eliminates certain
 
06:02:35.760 --> 06:02:37.190 align:start position:0%
license types and eliminates certain
boards

06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
boards
 
06:02:38.690 --> 06:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
I know this committee has already
 
06:02:41.090 --> 06:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
addressed a universal licensure
 
06:02:44.330 --> 06:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
recognition in some form through House
 
06:02:48.730 --> 06:02:48.740 align:start position:0%
Bill 594 which oplc certainly report
 
06:02:48.740 --> 06:02:50.350 align:start position:0%
Bill 594 which oplc certainly report
supports

06:02:50.350 --> 06:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
supports
 
06:02:54.048 --> 06:02:54.058 align:start position:0%
I think there are some data that you
 
06:02:56.690 --> 06:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
could find in our annual report to
 
06:02:57.910 --> 06:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
support this
 
06:03:00.350 --> 06:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
particularly during the experiment that
 
06:03:03.708 --> 06:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
was the code 19 emergency pandemic and
 
06:03:05.990 --> 06:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the emergency licensure process we
 
06:03:09.048 --> 06:03:09.058 align:start position:0%
observed an increase substantial
 
06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of licensed
 
06:03:13.788 --> 06:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
Healthcare professionals 22 000 we had
 
06:03:15.470 --> 06:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
fewer than 10 complaints that we
 
06:03:17.690 --> 06:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
received and we only had one reported
 
06:03:20.330 --> 06:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action and so I think that
 
06:03:22.368 --> 06:03:22.378 align:start position:0%
that those metrics really support the
 
06:03:25.490 --> 06:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
idea that we can in the office safely
 
06:03:28.430 --> 06:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicate licensure applications allow
 
06:03:30.048 --> 06:03:30.058 align:start position:0%
individuals from out of state to come
 
06:03:31.730 --> 06:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
into this our Workforce in an
 
06:03:33.650 --> 06:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
expeditious time frame without harming
 
06:03:35.868 --> 06:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
the public
 
06:03:37.250 --> 06:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
um some of the boards that have come
 
06:03:40.610 --> 06:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
before you recently to express certain
 
06:03:40.620 --> 06:03:42.410 align:start position:0%
before you recently to express certain
concerns

06:03:42.410 --> 06:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
06:03:44.030 --> 06:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to highlight some
 
06:03:46.310 --> 06:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
statistics particularly or around the
 
06:03:48.310 --> 06:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
mental health field
 
06:03:52.548 --> 06:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic I have 36 percent of
 
06:03:54.650 --> 06:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
latex we're practicing on an emergency
 
06:03:57.948 --> 06:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
license alone uh 45 percent of Mental
 
06:03:59.448 --> 06:03:59.458 align:start position:0%
Health Counselors were practicing on
 
06:04:01.970 --> 06:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
emergency license 38 percent of licensed
 
06:04:04.310 --> 06:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
clinical social workers 44 percent of
 
06:04:06.230 --> 06:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
them sorry just a moment I mean there's
 
06:04:08.330 --> 06:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
like a lot of information I'm trying to
 
06:04:10.490 --> 06:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
is it all on some sort of handout that
 
06:04:13.010 --> 06:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
we're gonna get no I can I I will email
 
06:04:16.310 --> 06:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
you an overall presentation after the
 
06:04:18.890 --> 06:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
fact the handouts will go along with
 
06:04:20.570 --> 06:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying right if you could hand
 
06:04:22.070 --> 06:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
that because I'd rather listen to you
 
06:04:25.128 --> 06:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
than you know yeah okay yes
 
06:04:25.138 --> 06:04:26.868 align:start position:0%
than you know yeah okay yes
certainly

06:04:26.868 --> 06:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
06:04:28.970 --> 06:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
so in any event
 
06:04:31.850 --> 06:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
um I think that the experiment that was
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
an emergency licensure certainly
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
supports the governor's proposal as does
 
06:04:41.330 --> 06:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
HB 594 and we very much strongly support
 
06:04:43.548 --> 06:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
um the proposal to allow for Universal
 
06:04:46.250 --> 06:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
licensure recognition
 
06:04:48.230 --> 06:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
um the second major proposed change is
 
06:04:51.770 --> 06:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
to transfer certain boards to oplc those
 
06:04:54.170 --> 06:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
being the board of actioners boxing and
 
06:04:57.470 --> 06:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
wrestling professional bondsmen those
 
06:04:59.090 --> 06:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
three are within the Secretary of
 
06:05:01.430 --> 06:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
State's office and my understanding is
 
06:05:02.868 --> 06:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
that the secretary of state does not
 
06:05:05.350 --> 06:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
object to those transfers
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
there's also a proposal to transfer the
 
06:05:10.910 --> 06:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
board of Licensing for interpreters for
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
the deaf deafblind and hard of hearing
 
06:05:15.770 --> 06:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education
 
06:05:15.780 --> 06:05:16.368 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education
um

06:05:16.368 --> 06:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:19.070 --> 06:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
in in truth the purpose of the transfers
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
is really to allow us to continue to
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
consolidate the administrative functions
 
06:05:25.970 --> 06:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
regarding licensure that the state
 
06:05:29.390 --> 06:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
already provides under oplc I've come
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
before you before to talk about some of
 
06:05:34.548 --> 06:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
our major strategic goals one being to
 
06:05:36.708 --> 06:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
achieve efficient operations by
 
06:05:38.930 --> 06:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
leveraging technology obtain a new
 
06:05:41.448 --> 06:05:41.458 align:start position:0%
licensing portal obtain a new CE broker
 
06:05:43.610 --> 06:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
portal and then to establish Eternal
 
06:05:46.128 --> 06:05:46.138 align:start position:0%
controls I think the governor's proposal
 
06:05:49.548 --> 06:05:49.558 align:start position:0%
is intended to ensure that all licensed
 
06:05:52.430 --> 06:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
individuals and or the agencies that
 
06:05:55.128 --> 06:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
license those individuals have access to
 
06:05:56.690 --> 06:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
the to this type of administrative
 
06:05:56.700 --> 06:05:58.250 align:start position:0%
the to this type of administrative
support

06:05:58.250 --> 06:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:06:02.330 --> 06:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
that would not otherwise be available if
 
06:06:05.750 --> 06:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
they are operating on their own
 
06:06:08.030 --> 06:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
so if I made a quick question before we
 
06:06:09.890 --> 06:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
go on on what she's discussing now on
 
06:06:12.410 --> 06:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
moving these
 
06:06:14.570 --> 06:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
licenses out of the Secretary of State's
 
06:06:16.730 --> 06:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
office I mean because we've had the
 
06:06:19.548 --> 06:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
boxing one before and my question is why
 
06:06:21.770 --> 06:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
are we removing
 
06:06:24.770 --> 06:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
something that licenses events and not
 
06:06:27.048 --> 06:06:27.058 align:start position:0%
professional licenses of individuals
 
06:06:29.868 --> 06:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
that makes no sense to me that is not
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
what your office is set up to do
 
06:06:34.910 --> 06:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why we voted this down in
 
06:06:37.430 --> 06:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
this committee before and I still feel
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
strongly it doesn't belong
 
06:06:42.890 --> 06:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
there again I totally agree this is a
 
06:06:45.170 --> 06:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
completely different kind of license as
 
06:06:47.270 --> 06:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
you stated representative it's an event
 
06:06:49.970 --> 06:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
license is not at all like the other
 
06:06:53.690 --> 06:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
licenses and we had this bill
 
06:06:56.930 --> 06:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
and we kept it where it is for a reason
 
06:06:59.150 --> 06:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
if I may representative
 
06:07:01.970 --> 06:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
um the the boxing commission does
 
06:07:05.090 --> 06:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
license people they license
 
06:07:07.190 --> 06:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
um the referees they also license people
 
06:07:11.150 --> 06:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
who are participating in these events
 
06:07:13.150 --> 06:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is the criteria is
 
06:07:15.830 --> 06:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat limited based on the
 
06:07:17.150 --> 06:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
information I could find on their
 
06:07:19.190 --> 06:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
website but they do license the
 
06:07:21.170 --> 06:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
individuals in fact they have to female
 
06:07:23.570 --> 06:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
female participants have to undergo
 
06:07:25.548 --> 06:07:25.558 align:start position:0%
medical screening HIV tests pregnancy
 
06:07:28.730 --> 06:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
tests prior to an event so there is a
 
06:07:30.110 --> 06:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
certification process for the
 
06:07:31.610 --> 06:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
individuals as well
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
question yeah
 
06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
so are these people that are licensed
 
06:07:38.330 --> 06:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
referees and so forth that is all New
 
06:07:40.070 --> 06:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents
 
06:07:41.930 --> 06:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know that they're residents I
 
06:07:44.208 --> 06:07:44.218 align:start position:0%
just know that in order to to
 
06:07:46.368 --> 06:07:46.378 align:start position:0%
participate in these events in New
 
06:07:48.110 --> 06:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you have to have a license and
 
06:07:49.610 --> 06:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the boxing
 
06:07:53.470 --> 06:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
commission did request this transfer
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
well I I think one of the things under
 
06:07:58.490 --> 06:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
underlying principles without a follow
 
06:08:00.650 --> 06:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
is that these things ought to be done
 
06:08:03.530 --> 06:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
individually judgments ought to be made
 
06:08:06.110 --> 06:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
on individual merits individual
 
06:08:08.330 --> 06:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
circumstances and so forth as we're
 
06:08:10.490 --> 06:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
discussing right at the moment and not
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
all loaded into a boxcar and shipped out
 
06:08:15.650 --> 06:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
in one Festival yes representative
 
06:08:17.208 --> 06:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I asked
 
06:08:21.350 --> 06:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
the this was something that we would
 
06:08:24.048 --> 06:08:24.058 align:start position:0%
have liked to have had before House Bill
 
06:08:27.650 --> 06:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
2 was released but unfortunately we it
 
06:08:30.770 --> 06:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
was too slow and we didn't have the time
 
06:08:32.868 --> 06:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
to do it this
 
06:08:35.270 --> 06:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
I understand every one of us has some
 
06:08:37.548 --> 06:08:37.558 align:start position:0%
objection to some part of the the
 
06:08:41.770 --> 06:08:41.780 align:start position:0%
structure I was would like to let
 
06:08:44.690 --> 06:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
director Courtney continue explaining
 
06:08:48.350 --> 06:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
the this is the overview of what's in
 
06:08:52.788 --> 06:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
the governor wanted in House Bill 2 and
 
06:08:55.868 --> 06:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
uh if you wish to
 
06:08:58.310 --> 06:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
register an objection with the governor
 
06:09:00.708 --> 06:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
or suggest to finance that something be
 
06:09:00.718 --> 06:09:01.788 align:start position:0%
or suggest to finance that something be
deleted

06:09:01.788 --> 06:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
06:09:04.128 --> 06:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
uh I will certainly support your doing
 
06:09:04.138 --> 06:09:05.448 align:start position:0%
uh I will certainly support your doing
so

06:09:05.448 --> 06:09:05.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:07.128 --> 06:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you I will certainly accept that
 
06:09:09.190 --> 06:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
invitation but I only
 
06:09:12.170 --> 06:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
jumped in on what representative goalie
 
06:09:13.850 --> 06:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
was referencing with regard to the
 
06:09:16.610 --> 06:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
boxing and and wrestling thing because I
 
06:09:18.410 --> 06:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
do think there's a distinct difference
 
06:09:20.628 --> 06:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
there especially if it turns out this
 
06:09:22.610 --> 06:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
bunch of these people are not even New
 
06:09:25.010 --> 06:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents now you're licensing
 
06:09:27.590 --> 06:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
somebody you know for a very specific
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
kind of thing we license people so that
 
06:09:33.288 --> 06:09:33.298 align:start position:0%
they can work in New Hampshire not
 
06:09:35.990 --> 06:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily because they are residents
 
06:09:37.730 --> 06:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
I understand but I think there's a
 
06:09:37.740 --> 06:09:42.010 align:start position:0%
I understand but I think there's a
distinction

06:09:42.010 --> 06:09:42.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:44.810 --> 06:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'll proceed on that note though I would
 
06:09:46.690 --> 06:09:46.700 align:start position:0%
note that the legislature last year
 
06:09:49.070 --> 06:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
repealed the administrative attachment
 
06:09:51.708 --> 06:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
of the commission to the Secretary of
 
06:09:54.048 --> 06:09:54.058 align:start position:0%
State's office so per 20 I think it's
 
06:09:56.930 --> 06:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
RSA 21 they're technically attached to
 
06:09:58.610 --> 06:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
the Das
 
06:09:59.868 --> 06:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that's actually
 
06:10:01.490 --> 06:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
happening so
 
06:10:04.490 --> 06:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
at some point this body if not in this
 
06:10:07.730 --> 06:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
bill may want to consider that
 
06:10:09.948 --> 06:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
um in terms of proposed mergers that's
 
06:10:13.330 --> 06:10:13.340 align:start position:0%
another major portion of House Bill 2
 
06:10:17.270 --> 06:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
and as this committee is well aware as
 
06:10:21.048 --> 06:10:21.058 align:start position:0%
proposed by House Bill 655 and hb2 oplc
 
06:10:23.150 --> 06:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
is proposed to issue licenses in between
 
06:10:25.430 --> 06:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
meetings in accordance with the rules
 
06:10:27.350 --> 06:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
that are established by the boards this
 
06:10:29.150 --> 06:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
really just codifies the practice that
 
06:10:30.890 --> 06:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
currently exists for a large majority of
 
06:10:32.750 --> 06:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
our licensing boards
 
06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
because boards under that proposal would
 
06:10:37.730 --> 06:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
no longer be reviewing
 
06:10:40.430 --> 06:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
applic every application at monthly
 
06:10:40.440 --> 06:10:42.230 align:start position:0%
applic every application at monthly
meetings

06:10:42.230 --> 06:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
06:10:44.570 --> 06:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
there's really not necessarily a need
 
06:10:49.730 --> 06:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
for such large bodies to do the work and
 
06:10:52.208 --> 06:10:52.218 align:start position:0%
so in light of this decrease workload
 
06:10:54.948 --> 06:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
hb2 proposes to merge certain boards
 
06:10:56.930 --> 06:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
that are sufficiently similar to
 
06:10:58.430 --> 06:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
increased efficiencies in the
 
06:11:00.410 --> 06:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
administrative process
 
06:11:04.368 --> 06:11:04.378 align:start position:0%
in particular hb2 proposes to merge The
 
06:11:06.830 --> 06:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board of reflexology with The
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board of Massage Therapy
 
06:11:12.530 --> 06:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
per our annual report just just so
 
06:11:14.170 --> 06:11:14.180 align:start position:0%
you're aware there are only 17
 
06:11:16.610 --> 06:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
reflexologists 12 structural integrators
 
06:11:19.548 --> 06:11:19.558 align:start position:0%
and four Asian Bodywork therapists the
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
disciplines of reflexology are often
 
06:11:23.990 --> 06:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
combined and just for your awareness you
 
06:11:25.448 --> 06:11:25.458 align:start position:0%
have a handout
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
from the Reflexology Association it's
 
06:11:31.510 --> 06:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
their National Association
 
06:11:35.030 --> 06:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
outlining the fact that reflexology to
 
06:11:37.310 --> 06:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
the extent that it is regulated is often
 
06:11:40.810 --> 06:11:40.820 align:start position:0%
already merged with massage
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
next The Proposal proposes to merge
 
06:11:46.730 --> 06:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
laidac with the boards of mental health
 
06:11:49.070 --> 06:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
practice and the board of psychology
 
06:11:50.868 --> 06:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
there are two states that currently
 
06:11:52.250 --> 06:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
combine psychology with other
 
06:11:56.868 --> 06:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
disciplines that being Kansas and Texas
 
06:12:00.230 --> 06:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
and again I think given the fact that
 
06:12:02.510 --> 06:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
mental health is one of those words are
 
06:12:03.770 --> 06:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
one of the fee boards that actually
 
06:12:05.690 --> 06:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
review applications at their monthly
 
06:12:09.770 --> 06:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
meetings under proposed 655 they would
 
06:12:11.510 --> 06:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
no longer be required to do that unless
 
06:12:13.330 --> 06:12:13.340 align:start position:0%
there was a defect in the application
 
06:12:15.170 --> 06:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:12:19.430 --> 06:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and so therefore the proposal would
 
06:12:22.430 --> 06:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
propose to combine psychology with other
 
06:12:25.310 --> 06:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
two other mental health disciplines
 
06:12:28.910 --> 06:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
third the hb2 proposes to merge uh Board
 
06:12:31.368 --> 06:12:31.378 align:start position:0%
of Medicine with Board of Podiatry
 
06:12:32.810 --> 06:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Board of Medicine
 
06:12:35.750 --> 06:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
currently regulates both MD's dos
 
06:12:38.690 --> 06:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
osteopaths and physician assistance
 
06:12:41.448 --> 06:12:41.458 align:start position:0%
11 states currently use one board to
 
06:12:43.430 --> 06:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
regulate multiple disciplines including
 
06:12:43.440 --> 06:12:45.170 align:start position:0%
regulate multiple disciplines including
Podiatry

06:12:45.170 --> 06:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
Podiatry
 
06:12:47.270 --> 06:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
I'm currently New Hampshire Board of
 
06:12:49.490 --> 06:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
Podiatry is a five-member board and
 
06:12:51.890 --> 06:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
they're only 91 podiatrists in New
 
06:12:54.350 --> 06:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I know that the chair was here
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
the other day and expressed that there
 
06:13:00.048 --> 06:13:00.058 align:start position:0%
had been I think over 40 complaints last
 
06:13:00.058 --> 06:13:02.390 align:start position:0%
had been I think over 40 complaints last
year

06:13:02.390 --> 06:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:04.430 --> 06:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
that really is because the board
 
06:13:06.830 --> 06:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
previously never enforced their
 
06:13:09.048 --> 06:13:09.058 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements chose
 
06:13:11.868 --> 06:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
to do so this year and 47 did not meet
 
06:13:15.048 --> 06:13:15.058 align:start position:0%
them but it was really an anomaly in the
 
06:13:16.970 --> 06:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
year prior to that they had only had one
 
06:13:16.980 --> 06:13:18.590 align:start position:0%
year prior to that they had only had one
complaint

06:13:18.590 --> 06:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
06:13:21.530 --> 06:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
and then finally hb2 proposes to merge
 
06:13:24.708 --> 06:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
Engineers with land surveyors both
 
06:13:26.448 --> 06:13:26.458 align:start position:0%
boards are currently supported by the
 
06:13:28.250 --> 06:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
National Council of examiners for
 
06:13:31.788 --> 06:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
engineering and surveying ncees 36
 
06:13:34.128 --> 06:13:34.138 align:start position:0%
states have combined boards according to
 
06:13:37.070 --> 06:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
ncees and only nine states have
 
06:13:40.010 --> 06:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
Standalone engineering boards and those
 
06:13:42.350 --> 06:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
states are for the most part fairly
 
06:13:42.360 --> 06:13:44.208 align:start position:0%
states are for the most part fairly
larger

06:13:44.208 --> 06:13:44.218 align:start position:0%
larger
 
06:13:45.890 --> 06:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
well I wouldn't say Delaware is too much
 
06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
larger but there's Florida Illinois
 
06:13:50.930 --> 06:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
Indiana Maine Maryland Michigan Vermont
 
06:13:52.730 --> 06:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
and West Virginia have are the only
 
06:13:54.530 --> 06:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
states that have stand-alone engineering
 
06:13:54.540 --> 06:13:58.490 align:start position:0%
states that have stand-alone engineering
boards

06:13:58.490 --> 06:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:01.010 --> 06:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
another major change that's proposed in
 
06:14:03.410 --> 06:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 are um to move certain
 
06:14:05.750 --> 06:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
boards to advisory boards
 
06:14:08.330 --> 06:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
and as you may recall or some of you may
 
06:14:11.208 --> 06:14:11.218 align:start position:0%
recall a seven I think it was six or
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
seven of our boards moved to the
 
06:14:16.548 --> 06:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
advisory model last legislative session
 
06:14:18.948 --> 06:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
this is the model that's currently used
 
06:14:21.350 --> 06:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
by Vermont in particular but but there
 
06:14:23.090 --> 06:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
are other states that utilize this model
 
06:14:25.310 --> 06:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
and it's becoming
 
06:14:28.010 --> 06:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
um increasingly trendy I should say on
 
06:14:30.708 --> 06:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
the occupational licensing front really
 
06:14:33.590 --> 06:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
to as a way to provide State super fight
 
06:14:36.288 --> 06:14:36.298 align:start position:0%
super supervision
 
06:14:43.128 --> 06:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:45.288 --> 06:14:45.298 align:start position:0%
I've been just notified by the house
 
06:14:47.330 --> 06:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
clerk that this is an illegal meeting
 
06:14:49.490 --> 06:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
because there's a quorum of the
 
06:14:51.530 --> 06:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
committee and it hasn't and it was not
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
known yes got it I'm aware of those
 
06:14:57.948 --> 06:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
issues all too well so I apologize for
 
06:15:00.170 --> 06:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
attempting to
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and please we would appreciate your
 
06:15:07.788 --> 06:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
your backup data because uh we didn't
 
06:15:09.830 --> 06:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
have time absolutely thank you for your
 
06:15:12.470 --> 06:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
time and I apologize to the public for
 
06:15:14.868 --> 06:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
not noticing this meeting thank you so
 
06:15:14.878 --> 06:15:17.058 align:start position:0%
not noticing this meeting thank you so
much
