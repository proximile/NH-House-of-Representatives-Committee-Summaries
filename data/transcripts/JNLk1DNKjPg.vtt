morning everyone um I come before you to
 
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 61 this bill allows
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters to cast their vote
 
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
by absentee ballot even when there is no
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
stated excuse this bill also allows
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities to partially pre-process
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots before Election Day
 
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
first I want to address the
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
pre-processing of absentee ballots
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
making this option permanent was a
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
request made to me by maram Max's Town
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
moderator in fact a couple of
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill both
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
Republicans are moderators or
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
co-moderators for their
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
towns and they are in strong support as
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
well allowing partial pre-processing of
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots is a bipartisan Common
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
Sense option for those municipalities
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
who want to better manage their workload
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
of election day it proved to be a life
 
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
saver for marac as it allowed us to
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
efficiently manage a huge uptick in
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots while maintaining the
 
00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
process we also learned from the
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
November election that expanding
 
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
absentee balloting absentee voting
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
encourages more citizens to participate
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
84,4 N9 votes were cast in the November
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
election breaking the previous record
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
for voter turnout growth in absentee
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
value balloting drove this growth as we
 
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:04.670 align:start position:0%
value balloting drove this growth as we
saw

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
26,27 of those votes cast by absentee or
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
32% of the total in 2016 only 10% of
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
Voters cast their vote by
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
absentee how is this jump in voter
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
participation explained yes fear of
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
covid kept many people home and opting
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of the executive order
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
allowing absentee voting how I believe
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
it was more than this there are people
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
who just avoid interacting with
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
strangers Co or not or a fear of
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
procedure or building that they are
 
00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with or they may be
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
intimidated walking through the gauntlet
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
of candidates and campaign standing
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
outside the polls all of us have
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
campaigned and I'm sure as we're out
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
there holding our signs and and greeting
 
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
voters some just cower it's it's very
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
intimidating to them and some just
 
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
decide not to go through that and stay
 
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
home these folks feel more confident
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
voting by absentee in the familiar
 
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
environment of their home but until the
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
covid excuse they just opted not to vote
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
at all so this bill is really about
 
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919 align:start position:0%
Liberty the state of being free within
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
Society from control or oppressive
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions imposed by government why
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't a citizen be free to vote by
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
absentee why do they need an excuse why
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
should they have to meet one of the
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
governments stated excuses in order to
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
exercise their voting rights back in the
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
day when I was working juggling the
 
00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:38.599 align:start position:0%
schedule of three kids and a home I
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
often wondered why the guy next door got
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
to vote at his convenience in his home
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
because of business travel but I did not
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
why was I denied that right why do we
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
deny that right to tens of thousands of
 
00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:54.630 align:start position:0%
deny that right to tens of thousands of
granite

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
granite
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
Staters now you may hear that absentee
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
Val absentee voting is dict dictated by
 
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution allow me
 
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:05.959 align:start position:0%
to read to you part one article 11 of
 
00:09:05.959 --> 00:09:06.949 align:start position:0%
to read to you part one article 11 of
our

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
constitution quote the general court
 
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
shall provide by law for voting by
 
00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
qualified voters who at the time of the
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%

elected or upon any question submitted
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
at such election please note the first
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
seven words of that
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
article the general court shall provide
 
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
by law the general court shall provide
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
by law the general court is US folks we
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
are the general court we pass the laws
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
that govern voting let's use use our
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
constitutional power to pass a law to
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
allow all New Hampshire citizens the
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
Liberty to vote by absentee not just for
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
those with an excuse now you will hear
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
speculation that expanding the right to
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
absentee voting will cause problems
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
increased risk of fraud increased
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
activity by special interest groups Etc
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
that risk already exists whether we
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
allow no excuse absentee voting or not
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
we have the power to address that now
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
let's not allow that risk to paralyze us
 
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
from moving forward already 2third of US
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
states allow no excuse absentee voting
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should not be left behind
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
after after all of all the states we
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
value Liberty let's put it into action
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
by recommending ought to pass on HB 61
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
and I would be very happy to answer any
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank you
 
00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:01.959 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions from
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
members in the room representative Brian
 
00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:06.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
m are you aware uh of the wording in RSA
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
6571 that uh describes the eligibility
 
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
for voting absentee right now and that
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
includes an employment obligation which
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
also is defined employment is defined as
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
the care of children and in adults with
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
or without compensation
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
neighbor ability
 
00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:37.990 align:start position:0%
neighbor ability
vente

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
vente
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
the I'm I couldn't really hear I think I
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
got the gist of your question uh yes I'm
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
aware of it but when I was raising
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
children I didn't have that option but
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
many people don't they you know they
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
just want that allowance they don't know
 
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
what election day is going to bring to
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
them or what's going to happen in their
 
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
lives is there going to be a football
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
practice to get to and many people
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
interpret that as um you know maybe
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
caring for an infant where you have to
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
Pro provide their primary needs but
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
running people running kids around to
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
practices or different classes um they
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
may not think of it and I think a lot of
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
people to be honest don't read the rsas
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
I think if they realize that they have
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
the right to vote by absentee they'll
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it they're not going
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
to go and search and find out all those
 
00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:27.870 align:start position:0%
to go and search and find out all those
specific

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
reasons other questions from committee
 
00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:32.839 align:start position:0%
members follow up representative from
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
Brian thank you
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
chair I'm not aware of what the
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
tradition is for uh and the situation in
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
every Community is but in my community
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
when I campaign or when I my sign I've
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
never had an interaction with a voter
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
that causes them to power and feares
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
this have you ever seen this in your own
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
oh AB I
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
me for coming
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
out um well well thank you for the
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
question oh I absolutely see people
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
avoid the candidates and the campaign
 
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
signs they walk on the other side of the
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
sidewalk but honestly I know people that
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
just don't vote they don't want to walk
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
through the gauntlet um you know we
 
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
think we're doing a great job we think
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
oh we're meeting the voters we're
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
helping them most people people don't
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
like that they don't want to be
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
approached they don't want to be talked
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
to or greeted by people they don't know
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
they just want to go in do their Duty
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
and get out and those people that that
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
don't even want to subject subject
 
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
themselves to that they stay
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
home this bill would allow them it's
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
like if you if you don't want to go
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
through that if you don't want to walk
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
past strangers greeting you if you'd
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
rather just stay home that's okay you
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
can still vote in the privacy of your
 
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.269 align:start position:0%
can still vote in the privacy of your
own

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
home thank you representative Barry so
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
have some further questions about can
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
you hear me all right representative R
 
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a little hard hearing people
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
in the room but but please go ahead
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
thank let me just interrupt I actually
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
representative R you I thought were
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
softer on the speaking this morning than
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
what we've had in the past do any other
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
members in the room think the volume is
 
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
lower than it has been in the past or
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
not a a little I think the volume
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
setting is a little different than it
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
has been so if everybody could speak up
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit that would be great
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
represent thank Madam
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
chairman representative R make follow
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
with representative' Bryant's questions
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
he makes some statements about voters
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
being intimidated and being approached
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the polls but that's electioneering
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's already illegal in the state
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to harass voters or
 
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:52.759 align:start position:0%
approach voters in the polls the the
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
moderators have great discretion in
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
setting up where where people can
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
campaign stand and we have to balance it
 
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
I think you make a good point but we
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
have to balance this against People's
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
First Amendment right to have political
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
speech it is in fact the most protected
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
speech in their constitution so I'm I'm
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
just wondering is if if this is the
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
number one concern for you shouldn't we
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
be addressing electioneering laws and
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
where how we're setting up polling
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
locations and not just going after
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
absentee Bing I've never heard this is a
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
this is a new one for me I've never
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
heard this one as the perhaps valid um I
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
use well thank you for the question I I
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
use as an example I I think if we get
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
out there and we talk to people in our
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
communities you're going to find people
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
they just don't want to go through that
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
they don't want to walk past the signs
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
and people saying good morning we don't
 
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:43.959 align:start position:0%
think it's harassment when I greet a
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
voter at the polls I say thank you for
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
coming out thank you for coming to vote
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's harassment but
 
00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
they do a lot of people don't want
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
strangers and they consider me a
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
stranger they may not they don't know me
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
personally they don't want me greeting
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
them and there are some people that just
 
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
want to vote in their own home and I
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't know why we allow some people to
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
do that and then we forbid other people
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
to do that I think all people should
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
have the right to vote in the privacy of
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
their home if we're going to allow some
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
people to do it we should allow everyone
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
it to me it's an issue of Liberty I
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
should have the same rights of someone
 
00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
who happen to schedule business travel
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%

Association and uh we are in support uh
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
specifically of sections 7 through 10 of
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
this bill we do not have a position on
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
sections one through six uh one through
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
six are the provisions for no excuse
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
absentee voting um our support is the
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
sections that deal with pre-processing
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
of absentee ballots uh as those of you
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
who have um have served as election
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
officials know the processing of
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots is a fairly tedious
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
process uh that ordinarily takes place
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
on Election Day at the polls and it
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
takes the attention of the moderator and
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
the clerk and the ballot clerks away
 
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
from other things uh other duties that
 
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.710 align:start position:0%
from other things uh other duties that
they

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
have and uh at a uh at a state election
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
especially a presidential election it
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
can take several hours um depending on
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
the size of the municipality to process
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots so either either it
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
happens during polling
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
hours uh which disrupts the uh the other
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
activities that are going on or it has
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
to be put off until the end uh of the
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
day and it makes a an extremely long day
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
that much longer during uh the fall
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
elections the um uh municipalities
 
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
polling places were allowed to
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
pre-process absentee ballots uh on a on
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
on a day before the election
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
where uh election officials would open
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
the outer envelope of the absentee
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
ballot read the name of the person uh
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
who had submitted it make sure
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
everything was in order and make a mark
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
on the checklist uh so that when the
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
final processing was done on Election
 
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
Day everything went much faster much
 
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.190 align:start position:0%
Day everything went much faster much
more

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
smoothly um the the
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
pre-processing was done in public it was
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh publicly po posted uh people were
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to be there and challenged just
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
as as they would on Election Day and
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
everyone who had anything to do with
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
this process thought that it worked very
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
well and one of the benefits that hadn't
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
really been anticipated was when um when
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
election officials discovered that there
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
was a a ballot that had not been
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
properly signed uh the affidavit was not
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
properly they were able to contact the
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
voter before election day and tell them
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
there was a problem and if the voter was
 
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
in town the voter could come in and uh
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
fix the problem so their ballot would be
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
counted in my town um and I am the
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
moderator in my town we identified six
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh absentee ballots that were not
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
properly completed and each of those six
 
00:20:19.149 --> 00:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
voters was able to come in and fix the
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
problem if we've been doing the
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
processing on um on Election Day that
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
would not have worked so this um House
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 61 sections 7 through 10 make that
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh make that ability to prepr
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
pre-process permanent and uh we very
 
00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919 align:start position:0%
strongly support that and again are
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
neutral on sections one through six
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr johnon
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here who has a
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
question Mr
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
Johnson representative to rosan thank
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you Mr Johnson for
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question prior to the 2020
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
election cycle were you aware of any
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
problems with doing the pre-processing
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
of aeny ballots on Election Day where
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
they were there any problems doing
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
that do during the processing on
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
Election Day um yeah I would say there
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
the the main problem was how much time
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
it took um in in uh larger uh larger
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
towns and larger City Wards there were
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
reports of uh election officials having
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
to work on uh processing the absentee
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
ballots uh way past the time that the
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
polls closed so that they ended up uh uh
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
finally counting the ballots and Rec
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
reconciling the ballots at one or two
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning uh and um a large
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
part of that problem was the need to
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
process the absentee ballot in September
 
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
and November that problem really went
 
00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.830 align:start position:0%
and November that problem really went
away

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.400 align:start position:0%

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
emergency order in place that allow
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
pre-processing for local elections which
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
are really beginning the majority of
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
them will be next week do you know how
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
many communities have it to take
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
advantage of the preprocessing for those
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
elections no I don't I I would guess
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
that it's relatively small uh because as
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know turnout at Town elections is is
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
much lower than turnout at State
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
elections in my town for example I
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
checked with the clerk last week and she
 
00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
said we had 12 absentee bot
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
applications as opposed to in the fall I
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
think we had uh something like
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
700 so um in our town there's no need to
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
do the pre-processing for Town elections
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
at least not this year it's really uh
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's really an issue at the state
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
elections in in the even number of
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.510 align:start position:0%

I pronounced that right welcome to the

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
law thank you very much Madam chairwoman
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
you pronounced it perfectly my name is
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
Laura tersi and I represent Hillsboro 35
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
which is Nashua Ward 8 I'm testifying
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
today in support of hp61 as a co-sponsor
 
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
and in particular to advocate for the
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
partial pre-processing of absentee
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
ballots since 2016 I have worked as a
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
poll worker for a number of elections in
 
00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:42.039 align:start position:0%
nsha in addition to serving a two-year
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
term as award selectman from 2017 to9 I
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
can tell you from experience that the
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
people who work our elections do it
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
because they believe in the Democratic
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
process and want to give back to our
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
community but if you've never worked a
 
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
full election day I'm not sure you can
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
understand the physical stamina and
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
energy that is required in naswa we
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
welcome voters from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
p.m. that means our po workers arrive at
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
5: and spend hours on their feet or in
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
metal folding chairs Manning the
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
checklist and assisting voters in
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
addition to processing absentee ballots
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
after the doors close the work is just
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
beginning as ballots are counted and
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
paperwork completed where you need to be
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
sharp accurate and attentive to details
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
often not finishing until well after
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
midnight the majority of our pole
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
workers are senior citizens and
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
recruiting workers has become more and
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
more difficult as the work is physically
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
and mentally exhausting taking just this
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
one task the partial pre-processing of
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and allowing election
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
officials to do some of that work in
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
advance takes a small burden off these
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
workers who already are responsible for
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
so much on the day of the election
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
anything that allows a person to be more
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
arrested and complete the task at hand
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
accurately is a good thing for our
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
election process we saw that it worked
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 elections and I encourage
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
you to keep it I'll conclude there and I
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
just thank you for considering my
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
remarks today thank you thank you very
 
00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:14.919 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony any members in
 
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
the room of the committee that have a
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
question for the representative anybody
 
00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:21.559 align:start position:0%
online with a
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
question speak
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
up I I have a question uh and I
 
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps I should have asked it if
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
representative run but It sped to my
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
mind do you know whether the changes to
 
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
this bill are exactly the same as those
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
that were made last session to allow for
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
preprocessing in
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
November thank you for the question um I
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
do know that I had a conversation with
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative rung when we were
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
discussing me getting onto this bill and
 
00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919 align:start position:0%
I believe yes it is the same process as
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
was uh put forward last year thank thank
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%

meeting and I'm not seeing him so at
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
this time I note that deputy secretary
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
scanland is has his hand raised to speak
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
to this Bill Good morning Deputy
 
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.029 align:start position:0%

00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:40.039 align:start position:0%
scanon
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
welcome H good morning Madam chair
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm David
 
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
scanland deputy secretary of state um
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
and you know have a kind of a split uh
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
position on this particular piece of
 
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
legislation I will start off with the no
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
excuse absentee B uh B OT portion of
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
this and state our opposition to that as
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have done in the past uh for such
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
bills um the first issue is the
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
Constitutional hurdle and you know I
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
know representative Rong uh mentioned
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
that earlier and she is right that it's
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the sentence in article 11 part one
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution that applies to this
 
00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
does say that the general court shall
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
provide by law for voting by qualified
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
voters at the time of
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
banial or state election or of the
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
primary elections therefore or of City
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
elections or town elections by official
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
ballot are absent that's a very specific
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
term and then it goes on to say or who
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
by physical disability are unable to
 
00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
vote in person so there are two specific
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
reasons in the Constitution for which a
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
person can vote absentee if you look at
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
the history of how that the uh the
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
absentee and the disability Provisions
 
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
entered into the Constitution at the
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
earlier part of the L the 1900s you will
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
see that those were very intentional
 
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
additions to the Constitution uh by the
 
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.430 align:start position:0%
additions to the Constitution uh by the
state

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
legislature so you know we believe that
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
that that that provision in the
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution precludes just a a blanket
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
no excuse absentee balloting
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh process in addition to that though
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
opening up the uh absentee voting to
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
anybody for any reason does create some
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
issues and could potentially Place some
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
burdens and pressures on voters that do
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
not currently exist and we saw some of
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
this uh in the last election where uh uh
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
concern over covid was considered a
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
disability and so it broadly opened up
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
the issue of absente voting we did see
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
organizations political parties and
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
candidates use that uh to uh uh um
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
broadly Target voters to encourage them
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
to vote that way and you know further
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
raises concerns of uh of management of
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots by organizations
 
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
parties or or campaigns um you may have
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
heard the term ballot harvesting uh
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
which has been an issue in other states
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
that is a real concern and uh and you
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
know any effort to uh allow no excuse
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
absentee voting also has to address
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
those issues whether they are real or
 
00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
perceived um they are a major
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
concern moving on to the uh
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
pre-processing of absentee
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
ballots um that the the that provision
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
as it was applied in the state elections
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
in 2020 was very well received by local
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
election officials uh it did have
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
significant benefits in allowing the
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
workload uh to be spread out um
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
additionally as was mentioned earlier uh
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
it gave election officials the
 
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contact voters where uh
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
there were deficiencies in the absentee
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh ballot mostly the affidavits where
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
the voters could be contacted uh address
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
those concerns and make sure that their
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
ballots were counted on the day of the
 
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.990 align:start position:0%
ballots were counted on the day of the
election

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
that was a tremendous benefit so we are
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
favorable to that provision as it was
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
applied uh uh in the 2020 elections
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
however I will say that in in this bill
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
in section 10 on line uh line 20
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
starting on line 20 on page seven uh it
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
says the moderator or his or her design
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
May begin the processing of absentee
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
ballots prior to the opening of the
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
polls provided that the clerk shall Post
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
in an appropriate place um and prior to
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
election day notice in time and place of
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
processing that is something that is new
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh the way I read that language it would
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
allow the processing of absentee before
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
the election there's no time frame
 
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't say the morning of the election
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
before the polls open uh it doesn't say
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
the week prior it just says that they
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
make that absentee ballots may be
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
processed prior to the election and we
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
are very much opposed to that and do not
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
think that that is necessary or
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
appropriate um in this piece of
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
legislation um with that I will end
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
there Madam chair and I would be happy
 
00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions from
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
committee members in the room
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative toosan thank you madam
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Deputy scanland for
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
question uh in the past prior to the
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
2020 election um where they weren't uh
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
actually pre-processed prior to the
 
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
election if there was an anomaly or a
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
problem with one of the ballots uh was
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
there still the ability for the somebody
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
um supervisor checklist or somebody in
 
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.269 align:start position:0%
um supervisor checklist or somebody in
the

00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
town to reach out to the voter to to get
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
a an answer to
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
the the anomaly or is it that simply the
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
vote simply thrown out under how we've
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
done it prior to 202
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
prior to 2020 if there was an issue with
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
a a an absentee ballot uh there would be
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
a limited opportunity for the voter to
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
be contacted but but in practice uh it
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
was probably not exercised very often uh
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
because of the tremendous workload that
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
takes place uh on the day of the
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
election by election officials and the
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
moderator especially in in general
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
elections um and general elections where
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
there's a president uh on the ballot um
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
the there just isn't time and and the
 
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
moderators have been asking for a
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
process uh like occurred um during the
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
2020 election for some time before the
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
2020 election and before covid um it you
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
know it has been recognized as an area
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
that uh needs some leave and
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
so the co situation forced us to do it
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
for the last election cycle uh it was
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
positive it worked well and uh and I I
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
think it was a very useful tool for the
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
moderators thank you other questions
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
room questions from people in attendance
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative BL members thank you yes
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um you mentioned
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
concern about ballot harvesting um was
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
there any inkling or anything that
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
happened in this past election that
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
caused you any concern in that area or
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
is that coming from other
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
states thank you for the question
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
represent Lane the we know that that
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
there have been issues in other states
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh with that practice and we also know
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
that the campaigns uh have become very
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
sophisticated in the way in the way they
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
deal with absentee ballots and there
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
have been major efforts to identify who
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
potential absentee voters are uh these
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
organizations that are not affiliated
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
with the state or or the municipalities
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
send mailings to those individuals in
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
many cases making it look like they are
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
mailings from a government entity
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to vote by
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
absentee and um and uh in 2020
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
specifically uh that that whole process
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
was ramped up even more to where uh uh
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
where these groups were out there uh
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
sending mailings uh using social media
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh and other uh ways of contacting
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
voters uh letting them know that voting
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
was easy and you could attend their you
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
know their voter uh their voter help
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
site and uh you know they would have all
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
the help that they would need to make
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
sure that their absentee ballots were uh
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh applied for received
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
and and delivered back and so I can see
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
from my vantage point I can see that
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
this could certainly go in that
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
direction uh if we don't have controls
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
in place uh if we Implement uh a no
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
excuse absentee Bing uh balloting
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
law uh can I have a followup please sure
 
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.829 align:start position:0%
law uh can I have a followup please sure
um

00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
so the but our current law requires you
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
to either mail it in yourself or deliver
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
it yourself to the state so isn't that a
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
safeguard for ballot
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
harvesting our our current law um places
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
the burden on the voter uh the
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the voter to request
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballot fill it out uh and
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
mail it in and make sure that it gets
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
delivered to the clerk that has changed
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
slightly within the last six or eight
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
years where we have introduce the
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
concept of a Delivery Agent where now
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the first time a voter is able to uh
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh convey that responsibility to get
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
their ballot to the clerk to another
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
individual um and that is part of this
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
process of opening the door up to that
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
type of activity where you know if we
 
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
continue to expand the the definition of
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
Delivery Agent and and you can see the
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
last few elections that has has been uh
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
that has been attempted um we're
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
starting to to create that climate
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
where uh we have outside groups other
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
than the voter that are going to attempt
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
and and and try to administer and manage
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
the absentee balloting process for
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
voters so you know they can remind uh
 
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
the voters that that they can vote by
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
absentee uh it can be made incredibly
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
easy for them by targeting the voter
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
with with pre-populated forms that they
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
just have to sign and and get back to
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
the clerk if um if these if if these uh
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
voters are doing it through some type of
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
an app uh or uh software program that is
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
made available to them uh these groups
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
might be able to determine when uh the
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
voter might be receiving their absentee
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
ballots um um there's just there are
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
just ways for these groups to in into
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
the process that up until now has been
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
voter further questions from committee
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
members I'm sorry representative
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
mad thank you kindly Madam chair um I
 
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to follow this concern I'm
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
first I have two questions really was is
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
there evidence that uh objectionable
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
forms what you call um harvesting
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
occurred in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the past El in the 2020 election and
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
I guess second does this bill expand the
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
definition of a delivery agent in in the
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
manner that you just objected to uh no
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
to both
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
pet thank you madam chair so uh Deputy
 
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
scanland um so you referred to in in the
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
section of about the pre-processing of
 
00:39:57.839 --> 00:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
section of about the pre-processing of
absentee

00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
ballots um You referred to uh section 10
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
line 20
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
21 that says that uh moderator or his or
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
her design May begin the processing of
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
absentee prior to the opening of the
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
polls and but down below in that
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph in line
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
27 it says the partial processing of
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots prior to an election
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
shall occur on the Thursday Friday
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
Saturday or Monday prior to the date of
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
the election after the posting of the
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
checklist does that not answer your
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
question about um or maybe I
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
misunderstood but I thought you said
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
that it seemed to allow the moderator to
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
allow the pre-processing at any time but
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
this makes it very specific that it's uh
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the question
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet I I agree with the
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
the the portion of the uh of that
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
section that start s on line 27 because
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
we are talking about the partial uh uh
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
pre-processing of absentee ballots uh on
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
the Thursday Friday Saturday or Monday
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
prior to the election that's fine but
 
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
but when you look at line 21 it says
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
something very different it says the
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
moderator or his or her design May begin
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
the processing of absentee ballots that
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
is that's that is doing the processing
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
of absente ballots not pre processing
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
not something that is um you know the
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
the activity that occurred in 2020 that
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
is processing absentee ballots before
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
the polls open and that's what we would
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
be vigorously opposed
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
to I see thank you very
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
Members representative gr thank you
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair um thank you for taking my
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
question New Hampshire has a voter ID
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
law are absentee ballot applicants
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
required to show uh an ID in order to
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
ballot the answer to that is no there is
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
not a requirement to show an ID to
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
obtain uh an absentee ballot um in the
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
past the the the check there was that
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
the voter is required to sign the
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
application for an absentee ballot and
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
then when the absentee ballot is
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
returned uh there is an affidavit that
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
is on the envelope that contains the
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot that the voter is also
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
required to sign and so in in up until a
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
few years ago uh the moderators were
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
able to check the signature on the
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
application to make sure that it matched
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
the uh signature on the affidavit
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
envelope um there was a court case that
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
challenged the constitutionality of that
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
because moderators are not uh
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
professional handwriting experts and
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
they uh the court determined that um
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
that the signature comparison could no
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
longer be a determining Factor on
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
whether an absentee ballot was uh
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
received or not if the signature was
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
missing on the application that would be
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
on the application or the affidavit
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
envelope that would be reason to reject
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot uh or if the name was
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
different if there were two different
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
people that signed the application and
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
the affidavit envelope that would be a
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
reason for
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
rejection unless unless the differing
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
signature was somebody that was
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that they were helping an
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
individual with a
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
disability so effectively there is no
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
um on absentee ballots coming in because
 
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
the sign ature matching portion of it is
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
no longer a tool that the moderators
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
have now a person that is uh requesting
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot in person from the
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
clerk uh can voluntarily show their ID
 
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
to the clerk and if they do that that
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
that allows
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
for a verification of that uh
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
individual's absentee ballot um helping
 
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
it through the process uh when it gets
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
question representative brow uh Mr
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
scanon would that not
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
then allow more ease for ballot
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
harvesting if if uh there's essentially
 
00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:42.910 align:start position:0%
harvesting if if uh there's essentially
no

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
verification no good accurate
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
verification of who the voter is when
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
there's at when there at bot
 
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
applications uh that's a good question
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
represent representative gr at the
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
moment the respon responsibility to
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
receive and return an absentee ballot is
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
still on the voter and and under our
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
current laws excuse me you know the
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
ballot harvesting concern is uh is not
 
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
very high in my opinion it is it is when
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
we open it up um to no excuse where you
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
know anybody can uh uh you know request
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot for any reason is
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
when the concern in my opinion uh grows
 
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.230 align:start position:0%
when the concern in my opinion uh grows
pretty

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
dramatically thank you further questions
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%

mayad thank you madam chair I I wonder

have an official publication in which it
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
uh discusses the facts about voter
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
harvesting as uh as the Secretary of
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
State's office understands the
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
problem uh the the answer is no
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%

Mr I'm sorry uh I probably did not do
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
justice to your
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%

wanted to join the discussion on House
Bill

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
61 thank you thank you um can I be heard
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
now am I on yes okay so I was going to
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
testify in a little bit different way
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
but most of what I was going to say has
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
already been said and I'm a former State
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
Rep so I know it's appreciated if things
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
are not repeated thank you all right so
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
the one thing I wanted to talk about was
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
um my experience on helping with early
 
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
opening of the absente ballots we I'm in
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
do and I was an observer of that uh that
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
process for three days when we did it in
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
do and we had people there from the
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
Republican party and from the Democratic
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
party and we were all able to hear whose
 
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
ballots were rejected it was almost
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
always because they hadn't signed the
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
inner envelope so there was uh so they
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't be counted I personally sent
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
notes to people or dropped a note off at
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's door or called them if I was
 
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
able to find out information to tell
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
them that their ballot had not been
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
counted and for what reason and I got
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
several people thanking me very ferous
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
for letting them know and so the early
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
opening is really important for people
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
who might make a mistake that's usually
 
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
just a clerical error and they get it
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
informed and then they can go in either
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
to the city clerk and do a new Ballot or
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
they can actually decide to show up on
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
election day and vote um to get their
 
00:47:59.470 --> 00:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
vote counted so I think the early
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
opening is really important I would add
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
one other thing I wasn't going to talk
 
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
about you've asked a lot about ballot
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
harvesting and I also follow this issue
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
and I agree that ballot harvesting is
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
really a terrible practice and whenever
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
it's done it's illegal and the fact that
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
absentee balloting would be excuse free
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
really is not going to make much of a
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
difference because if someone's intent
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
if some group is intent on doing that
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
they can use any one of the excuses and
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
they can talk to everybody and say look
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
all you have to say is you got kids at
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
home so you can vote absentee ballot or
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
people can do all kinds of Nefarious
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
things what happened in 2020 shows us
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen in New
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we are careful with
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
what we do with elections and so this
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
bill changes nothing about the
 
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
experience of 2020 which was all
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
positive so I would encourage very much
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this Bill thank
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%

East Side um House Bill 1560 um is one
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
you've seen before and in fact past last
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
session it would allow any voter who's
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
qualified to vote at the state election
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
to vote at such election by means of an
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot otherwise known as a no
 
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
excuse absentee voting which I know you
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
just covered similarly in a previous
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
bill um and just what does this do for
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
the people in New Hampshire it allows
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
flexible alternatives for voters and
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
allows them to participate it allows
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
them to cast their ballot before
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
election day without an excuse um this
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
gives voters especially lower income
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
voters um methods to alternatives to go
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
to election day allowing them to cast
 
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
their votes and become active citizens
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
under the current law only voters that
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
have a an excuse May obtain an absentee
 
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
ballot um without an excuse um they
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
can't go early forcing them either to
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
vote an election day or in some cases to
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
actually lie if they want to vote about
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
why they need an absentee ballot um you
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
might ask what what purposes would they
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
have to vote that's not in the ballots
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I would ask you to think about
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
someone that works in a um a very
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
lowincome job or a low-paying job quite
 
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
often they're called in at the last
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
minute they know it's a possibility but
 
00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
they don't know it's going to happen and
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
many people don't want to take the
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
chance and lie and say they're going to
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
be working when they don't know it but
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
they could get a call at an hour's
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
notice and not be able to go in because
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
they're working all day so they're in a
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
possibility they can't go in um they
 
00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if they have a new child or
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
they have an elderly parent that they're
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
going to get sick yes there are the
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions for child care um or
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
caretaker but at the last minute so
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
these are people that know that there's
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
a possibility but they don't want to
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
take the chance and do what they would
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
perceive as a lie and say that it's
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
happening when in fact could wake up
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
election day and everything's fine and
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
they can go in so saying that there's no
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
excuse allows them that opportunity
 
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
providing voters with this flexible
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
alter alternative widens the base of
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
participation and fosters a democratic
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
environment in which people can exercise
 
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
their right to vote and make important
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
decisions um we already have voters have
 
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
excuses um like travel or sickness this
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
just makes it a little broader we ABS we
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
had that basically in this last election
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
when the co exception came in and we
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
didn't find massive fraud the Secretary
 
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
of State said we did not have harvesting
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the state and you heard if someone
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to really Harvest votes they
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
could do it with the excuses that
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
happening um so the cases of fraud that
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
happen everyone always brings that up
 
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
but we know they're minuscule in this
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
state and the fraud happens already with
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
the laws the way it is so I don't think
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to increase it and
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
statistics around the country have shown
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
that fraud has not broadened out there
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
are a number of states that do already
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
have um this kind of legislation this
 
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
kind of voting and their um cases of
 
00:53:34.109 --> 00:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
fraud are terribly small Oregon in fact
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
has all mail in voting and um since 2000
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
there's only been 33 cases of alleged
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
fraud which is comes out to
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
0.005% um pretty small for something
 
00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
that makes voting um much more Universal
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what we want is an
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
indust for people to vote um so how does
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
it work absentee voting is conducted the
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
exact same way that we have voting right
 
00:54:01.789 --> 00:54:01.799 align:start position:0%
now it's just instead of having a place
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
for the excuse it's not there it's just
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
that they want to receive an absentee
 
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
ballot um as I said many states already
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
have it five states um have almost
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
totally Universal mailing so I'm asking
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
you to take um a leap of faith to go
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
with what you've done in the past in
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
fact this did pass last time pass the
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
house past the Senate and the Govern
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
decided that the co exception would
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
cover it um but I think we need to make
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
it a little broader you need to be aware
 
00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:34.799 align:start position:0%
of the fact that while we might feel
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable not lying but stretching the
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
truth a little and saying that we can
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
can some these setion into the uh
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
exceptions that exist or the excuses a
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
lot of people out there feel very badly
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
about saying that just because their job
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
might call them in they don't want to
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
say they have to work because they don't
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily know positively they do so
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do what they think
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
is a lie and put that down they're going
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
to take the chance and if they get
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
called in that day and can't vote
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to miss the chance to vote
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
it might be a vote for you or I it might
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
be a vote for our opponents but we want
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
everyone to vote I think all of us here
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
believe in democracy and we'd love it if
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
we had 100% participation but it's not
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
for us to decide it's for those
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
individual voters so I'm just asking you
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
to give the voters of New Hampshire a
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
chance to go in it changes nothing the
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
absentee structure it's going to be the
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
exact same way that it's done now the
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
only difference is they don't put an
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
excuse in so when the Secretary of
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
States gets up and says this is going to
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
lead to massive fraud voter harvesting
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
all these other horrible things it's no
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
change the only change is we're not
 
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
having them put an excuse so why is it
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
that harvesting is easier here it's like
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
saying that when campaigns do rides to
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
the polls that's horrible because we're
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
taking a whole group of people and we're
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
giving them rides to the polls we're
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
making it easier because we're picking
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
them up at their houses and driving them
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
to the polls and campaigns are doing
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
this and they're sending out forums to
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
do rides to the polls and they're
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
picking them up at the same time that
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
that happened I'm sure back when cars
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
first came in the Secretary of State
 
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
back then thought it was a horrible
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
thing because we're helping voters and
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
making it easier well this is what's
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
happening now and maybe there are
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
pre-printed forms but they're already
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
doing pre-int printed forms for people
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
with the excuses on them so it's just a
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
step into the future to make more people
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
vote and yes it's making it easier but
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
isn't that the point do we want to make
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
voting really hard for people or do we
 
00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:41.559 align:start position:0%
want to make it something that people do
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
it's their civic duty they want to vote
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
and I think we want people to vote don't
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
we so I would ask you to please pass
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
this and I thank you for your
 
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
perseverance and listening to all of us
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
this morning and I represent thank you
 
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
representative Rogers if you would you
 
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
were me with the question um I think you
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
were here for part of the public hearing
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
on HB 61 which was the bill proceeding
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
yours would you agree that the
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
provisions as you have proposed in HB
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
516 are identical to those contained in
 
00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.190 align:start position:0%
516 are identical to those contained in
HB

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
61 I can't say for sure because I
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
haven't read um 61 they sounded like it
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
um but I would take your opinion for as
 
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
as the committee's looked at both bills
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
I would take your word for it all right
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um questions from committee
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
members in the
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
room representative
 
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
McDonald representative can you okay y
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
um Deputy scanland mentioned B
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
harvesting and you addressed that he
 
00:57:49.029 --> 00:57:49.039 align:start position:0%
also mentioned State constitutional
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
issues state constitution talks about
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
the only reasons for absente voting
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
right now can be
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
absence or disability have you taken
 
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
that into consideration constitutional
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
issues I know that the committee talked
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
about this last time and they resolved
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't there um I think that you
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
also have the caretaker position um
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me caretaker OB section that's in
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
there's now there's other things in
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
there and that's not been questioned so
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it's a
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
problem thank you other questions
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Barrett uh yes thank you
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative Robert for being here
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
you said in your customon you referen
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
the state of Oregon which has near near
 
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
Universal absente biding um you said
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
there's only been 33 cases of voter
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
fraud in Oregon I'm just curious what is
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
your acceptable threshold for voter
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
fraud I mean I think all of us want no
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
voter fraud but I think that if there's
 
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
only been 33 cases in 11 years um and
 
00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.309 align:start position:0%
only been 33 cases in 11 years um and
it's

00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
0.5 that's a pretty low bar so I I think
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
that we all want none but even our state
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
has had a little bit of voter fraud over
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
the course of the last 11
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
years there's always one person that
 
00:59:05.069 --> 00:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
tries to do something wrong by intent or
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
by by um on
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
education representative Mooney thank
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you representative
 
00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
Rogers are you able to hear me yes I am
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
perfect could you direct me if it's
 
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
there in your bill as to the time frame
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
of when uh your bill passed everybody
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
would be able to vote by absentee ballot
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
passage follow up uh thank you for that
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering for example uh okay we
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
have a primary and then you know a week
 
00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.039 align:start position:0%
before the general or a week before the
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
primary or a month before these
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
elections I'm I'm thinking of a time
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
frame like that oh okay no it would be
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
the the same as it currently exists in
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
law this would not change anything about
 
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
absentee voting except for the excuse
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions from
 
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:09.309 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions from
committee

01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
members representor o' Brian thank you
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
mad thank you for being here representa
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
and explaining your bill you talked
 
01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.870 align:start position:0%
and explaining your bill you talked
about

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
it and when you talked about it you
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
mating I
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
don't representative Barry said he said
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
near Universal I think it is universal
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
in Oregon I'm not aware of any polling
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
place that a person can go to in org now
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
do youate this bill with that sort of
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
situation with mail and voting would you
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
do you you consider to be a kind of
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
mailin voting have no
 
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
excuse voting
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time hearing you but I
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
think you asked me if I equated it with
 
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
mailin voting is that correct yes no
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's not equated with it but it's
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
similar in the fact that absentee
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
ballots are mailed in that's why I
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
offered the suggestion of an in Oregon
 
01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
where there is mailin voting and the
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
situation of fraud but no it's not mail
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
and voting it's simply the absentees are
 
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
done through the mail by and large I
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
understand some are carried in but by
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
and large it's done through the
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
mail thank you
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh are you are you aware of states that
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
do have more mail in voting uh let's
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
just say the states that have mail or
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
states that have no excuse at voting do
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
they consistently have higher voting
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
eligible population rates of voting I
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
think it varies to State um I don't know
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
all of the statistics I could probably
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
find them but I know Washington and
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
Oregon have mail in voting um I don't
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
know the exact statistic six of their
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
percent of um
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
participation thank you further
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
members I'm not seeing anything oh
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative browan thank you madam
 
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you representative Rogers
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
um with absentee ballots how can our
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
election officials verify especially the
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
more common it becomes the more people
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
that do it how can they verify that
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
those who apply for and use the absentee
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
Val process are actually the persons who
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
they say they are I think that they
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
doing the same way they do it now as I
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
said this changes nothing um it's just
 
01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
changing the excuse for it um now they
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
go through and and the moderators look
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
at the signatures the best they can and
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
make a decision on that um when they get
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
them um our law if you want to look at
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
the verification I think that's a
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
different part of the statute that you
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
want to look at this is simply the
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
excuse part of it um and the exceptions
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
that we go through with that right now
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
we have a number of SE exceptions
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
caretaker sickness um absence from town
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
disability um you have the same question
 
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
there as far as how you verify um I
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
think that if you want to talk about
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
verification that's a different part of
 
01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
the statute that you'd want to get into
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
and that's something that's um
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
reform follow up go ahead would you
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
support uh those who want to do absentee
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
ballots uh having to go into the clerk
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
to pick up their abs ballot and show
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
their voter
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
ID um no simply because there are some
 
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
people that couldn't do that there are
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
people individually individuals with
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities um and I can tell you right
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
now I am am so I suffer from a
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
disability and I'm having a flare up
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
right now I have not been able to get
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
out of my house for the last three weeks
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
physically I cannot get out of my house
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
so if I had to go to the clerk's office
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
to turn in a ballot I would physically
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
not be able to do so so I would be um
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
not allowed to vote and I know there are
 
01:04:16.349 --> 01:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
other people that are physically unable
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
to leave their their homes for a reason
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
of disability um or there there could be
 
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
other reasons that they cannot get into
 
01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:27.799 align:start position:0%
to the clerk's office um so I think that
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem for people that
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
would disenfranchise a whole class of
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
individuals um I think that they're that
 
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how you're going to
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
verify would be an extremely difficult
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
thing that you probably want to set up a
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
whole committee to look at over time and
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
come up with some suggestions but asking
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
the clerk asking them to go into a
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
clerk's office would disenfranchise I
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
fear a number of people with handicaps
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
follow thank you madam chair um for
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
those that you just mentioned are they
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
not already covered in the current
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
law yes but you just said would I would
 
01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
I favor somebody going into the clerk's
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
office to turn it in to
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
verify and that would prove a problem
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from
 
01:05:21.269 --> 01:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%

in the waiting room and I have asked the

computer to ask you to join us um if you
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%

committee thank you very much good
 
01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chairman and the committee
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
members I appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
present testimony this morning that I
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
believe is very important to the people
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire my name is Janice Kelby
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired postal worker and I live
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
in hookit New Hampshire I can share with
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
you some firsthand
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
experiences experiences of some of my
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
co-workers and of several family members
 
01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:15.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens take their right
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
and duty to vote very seriously and we
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
need to keep it that way by expanding
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
the opportunities to those who have
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty being able to cast their vote
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
during a designated 10 to 12 hour period
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
on a specific day being first in the
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
nation gives us a step up in raising
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
awareness of the importance of voting
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
now it's time for us to finally update
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
our laws to make it easier for working
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
people to have that voice thankfully
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
voting laws have changed considerably
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
over the years expanding the rights and
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to vote in 1790
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
white male property owners were the only
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
voters it took 60 years to pass laws
 
01:06:59.950 --> 01:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating property ownership
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and to remove religious
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
prerequisites and a far longer time
 
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
before women and African-Americans were
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
able to participate in our elections
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
laws across the country have continued
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
to evolve adapting to changing needs the
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
static that I'm going to refer to next
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
are pre pandemic so much changed in our
 
01:07:24.029 --> 01:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
past election that I don't dare attempt
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
the national update identifying all of
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
these very recent and some temporary
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
changes that were made but in early 2020
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
there were 39 States plus the District
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
of Colombia that had some method to
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
enable eligible voters to participate in
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
Election Day by casting their Val ballot
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
prior to election day either during an
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
open early voting period established by
 
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
the state or by requesting an absentee
 
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
ballot to more States Virginia and
 
01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
Delaware enacted early voting to begin
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and 2022 respectively no excuse
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
absentee voting is a commonly used
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
method to allow voters some flexibility
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
to make casting a ballot possible for
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
people who might otherwise be denied the
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
vote three other states Colorado Oregon
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
and Washington conduct all elections by
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
mail at that time there were only nine
 
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
states offering nothing as an
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
alternative to voting on Election Day
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
unfortunately New Hampshire is one of
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
those few states that has not yet
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
updated laws to meet the changing needs
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
of Voters that have occurred over the
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
years this is not my first time
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
testifying in favor of no excuse voting
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's unrealistic to expect
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
everybody in today's world to be able to
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
vote on a Tuesday during the hours that
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
the polls are open I have experienced
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
firsthand the difficulty of rising at
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
the crack of dawn rushing to get my
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
children up as a single parent dressed
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
fed and off to school or child care so
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
that I could get to work on time after
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
working all day and driving about 25
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
miles to the daycare center by the time
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
I got back into my neighborhood assuming
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
traffic was good I had less than an hour
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
before the polls closed my children were
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
ready for dinner lines at the polls were
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
at their worst and I had two fussy kids
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
I had to force to wait for their dinner
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
in order for me to vote the legislature
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
very wisely recently within the last six
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
years I'd say um addressed that
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
particular situation by adding a
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
dependent care as an acceptable excuse
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
to request an absentee ballot
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that was only one of many
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
cases that needed to be addressed so
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
while the change was desperately needed
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
it have failed to address the whole
 
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
problem my basic argument for no excuse
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
absentee voting has has always been the
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
premise that nothing in life is Promised
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
for anyone on a given day especially
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
within restricted hours sadly the 2020
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
election gave us a very Vivid
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
illustration of how important that fact
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
is thankfully through the joint efforts
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
of many people New Hampshire made it
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
possible for many who were unsure if
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
they would be able to appear in person
 
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
and voters came out in record numbers to
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
have their voices heard in a safe secure
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
election everybody was thrilled with the
 
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.110 align:start position:0%
election everybody was thrilled with the
outcome

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
of what was a sudden and unexpected need
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
right then to develop a system and it
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
happened honestly to my own amazement I
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
mean I think we ended up with a very
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
successful election where a lot of
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
people's voices were able to be heard I
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
think this is exactly what we should
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
always do I think we had 32% of the
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
electorate was able to vote absentee and
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
do it safely and
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
securely nobody should have to worry
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
about not being able to vote if they get
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
stuck in traffic after work or if
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
they're unexpectedly required to work
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
overtime certainly something I saw
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
working at the Manchester postal
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
facility seniors and others who fear
 
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
driving in the snow shouldn't have to
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
choose between driving anyway or not
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
voting what are their choices if they're
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
serious about wanting to vote nobody
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
should have to falsely apply for an
 
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot in advance or risk
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
driving on icy roads if they're not
 
01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing so just to cast a
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
ballot voting should not be a game of
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
chance I wonder how many of you wait
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
until the last day to file your
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
paperwork to run for office to become a
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
state representative I wouldn't wait
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
till the last till the deadline day some
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
people surely will and they still be
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
able to do it if we have no excuse
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
absentee voting but this is why a window
 
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
is needed to allow people to vote uh
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
nothing is promised to anyone on a given
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
day and the certainty of being able to
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
do anything is greatly increased by
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
offering a window of time and not
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
restricting it to just one opportunity
 
01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
unexpected illness car problems family
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
emergencies bad weather broken water
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
heater unexpected overtime shouldn't
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
stop me from having an opportunity to
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
vote if I truly care I should be able to
 
01:12:23.229 --> 01:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
make a plan ahead of the deadline just
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
in case obstacles appear that is
 
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
important to me and I hope you agree
 
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't a red state blue State issue
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
if you look at a map showing voting
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
rights you'll see that some of the most
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
Progressive states in the country have
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
expanded voting opportunities do have
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
some of the most conservative States
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough in
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
1997 Texas of all places passed a bill
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
allowing residents to cast absentee
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
ballots from space they did that because
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
that need existed in their Community it
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
existed in their state and they changed
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
the laws to meet the challenges of the
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
times currently according to our laws a
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
person votes or attempts to vote by
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and does not meet one of
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's very restricted limited
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable excuses that person shall be
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
guilty of a misdemeanor planning in
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
advance in order to ensure a voice in a
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
local state or national issues should
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
not be a crime limiting somebody's
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
ability to participate in our government
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
is the real crime New Hampshire please
 
01:13:32.189 --> 01:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
step up to the plate and meet our needs
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
now let's not be the last state to
 
01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
listen and to grow I urge you to vote

01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
citizens um excuse me U included in
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
those totals were
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
23,5 190 Republicans who voted by
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%

01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
66411 absentee ballots or 43% in the
 
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
general election
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
26,27 voters of all parties voted by
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
absentee 32% of the total clearly
 
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters appreciated having the
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
freedom of not having to choose between
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
their health and their inherent right to
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
vote so why not make that freedom
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
permanent why not let New Hampshire
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
citizens make their own decisions when
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
it comes to their freedom to vote
 
01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
instead of having government tell them
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
whether they're sick enough mobile
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
enough religious enough or employed
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
enough to vote by absentee HB 516
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
removes the current four excuses on the
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot application and lets the
 
01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
voter take personal responsibility for
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
their actions it does not remove the
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
process of the absentee ballot
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
application chain of custody or the
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
processing controls that have served us
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
well for very me many many years and I
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
would also add that U Deputy scanland
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
did not talk about the um the voter
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
registration process as it relates to uh
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and I think it's
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
important to note that you have to be
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
registered to be able to vote by
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
absentee you just don't um uh contact
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
the State the uh the local town clerk
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
get a and get a ballot you have to go
 
01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
through the registration process as well
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
so that is a check he didn't really
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
address New Hampshire has allowed
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
absentee voting uh absentee ballot
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
voting since um it let Hollis New
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire militia men in
 
01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
1775 vote by mail during the American
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
Revolution and from the beginning the
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot process has been
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
overseen by our friends and neighbors
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
who serve as each Town's election
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
official excuse me officials for 200
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
years absentee ballots have been until
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
recently without any suspicion or
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
accusations or doubt and for that same
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
time our election officials have
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
verified those voters and have protected
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of our elections and they
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%

01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh to our Republic as they've always had
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
a record 260,000 absentee ballots were
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
cast without any significant misuse in
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
November 2020 and the infantes issues
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
which did come up are being addressed as
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
they should be through our checks and
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
balances because we trust in the
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%

the ways to participate in the voting
 
01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
process they allow more people to vote
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%

William Gardner delivered a presentation
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
on the 2020 election to your committee I
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
was struck that secretary Gardner did
 
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
not mention fraud once the topic only
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
came up when committee members asked
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
Deputy scanland for help debunking

01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:35.000 align:start position:0%

01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
each Committee Member is getting emailed

anticipate requesting to speak today but
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
after after listening very carefully um
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add an aspect to the
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony with regards to no excuse uh
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
absentee voting uh I I I thank you very
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
much uh you and and the committee
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
members for giving me this
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity I uh
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
support uh hosp 56 Ste I am an
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
immunosuppressed person um I have had
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
extensive and very rigorous uh cancer
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
treatment and fortunately I am cancer
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
free however the residual effects from
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
that treatment renders me
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
immunosuppressed and renders me very
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
susceptible to illness now the covid um
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
Provisions have certainly helped with
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
that but there are also other things
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
that persist year-over-year such as our
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
fall and Spring Town elections are
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
during flu season and that's a season
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
where I need to avoid uh a lot of
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
contact with the outside similarly to
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
what we're doing right now for covid
 
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
concerns I know there are
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
folks undergoing uh active uh
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
chemotherapies I know there are folks
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
out there who have other
 
01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
immunosuppressed dis disorders
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
comorbidities Transportation issues we
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
face you know our fall and spring
 
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
elections potentially during bad weather
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
seasons and folks um have transportation
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
issues there's sometimes an issue of
 
01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
access for some of our more remote
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
locations folks are relying on other
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
people to get them here and there to
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
polling places and
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
those arrangements are not always
 
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
consistent so there are a lot of lenses
 
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
that I would just like you to look
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
through when you're considering
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
legislation such as this we had a very
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh robust voter turnout which I think is
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
just a salute to our Democratic process
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
I think that it allowed um many people
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
to vote that otherwise would not have
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
done that but even after after hopefully
 
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
soon Co is a thing in our history and in
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
our past there are other consistent uh
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
conditions that prevent us from wanting
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
to expose ourselves to large numbers of
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
public um or to have the opportunity to
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
even get there so uh we are not
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
considered disabled we are not
 
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
considered infirmed so we don't

that I'll be talking about during my
 
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
testimony to members of the committee
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
last night hopefully you receive that
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
and even if you didn't have a chance to
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
look at it hopefully you have it before
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
you attached to that those bullets are a
 
01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
copy of an amendment I'm going to be
 
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
proposing uh the amendment is very
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
lengthy but it's actually very simple so
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
I I will explain what that does in my um
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
remarks I also sent along a copy of the
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
current absentee ballot request form
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's available on the Secretary of
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
State's website because again you know
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're kind of talking a little bit
 
01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
about form design and I thought it might
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
be helpful for you to be able to look at
 
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
the actual form that that we're talking
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
about um some of these Provisions were
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 1266 which uh uh when it
 
01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
was sent over to which I sponsored last
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
term which was sent over to the Senate
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
and became the vehicle for the absentee
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
ballot request forms for uh covid and so
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
some of the elements of the bill that
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
were originally contained in that bill
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
um were not acted upon and some of the
 
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
other uh Provisions being uh proposed
 
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
here were the result of discussions held
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
during executive sessions for the
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
committee during the last term so let me
 
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.430 align:start position:0%
committee during the last term so let me
begin

01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
begin
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh the first thing that the bill
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
proposes is breaking out the language
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
that pertains to the request for an
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot for the presidential
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
primary election from that for all other
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
elections oh
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
no and uh the uh reason for doing that
 
01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
was sometimes there's an overlap when
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
the presidential election comes along
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
and during discussion in executive
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
sessions some of the committee members
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
felt it would be nice not to have all
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
that language pertaining to the
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
presidential primary election included
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
in an absentee ballot request form that
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
might be used for a city election or or
 
01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
a u another special election being held
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the fall um there there is no changes
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
any changes being made to the main
 
01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form are
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
reflected in in the presidential primary
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form and that
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
includes basically all the section
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
dealing beginning on page three line 32
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
through page five line 19
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh the second change that's occurring
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
and that's what the amendment is is
 
01:47:28.109 --> 01:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
about appreciated the heads up I cop
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
that you could always write him back
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative W can you mute sorry all
 
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
right thank you I'm sorry for getting
 
01:47:37.239 --> 01:47:38.790 align:start position:0%
right thank you I'm sorry for getting
distracted

01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
distracted
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
um currently the proposed bill says one
 
01:47:44.669 --> 01:47:44.679 align:start position:0%
of the reasons for requesting an absente
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
ballot is because I am unable to vote in
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
person due to a disability confinement
 
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
observance of a religious commitment or
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
and it continues and so the proposed
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
amendment would change confinement to
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
the words uh incarceration for reasons
 
01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
other than a felony conviction so that
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
we make it clear to the person filling
 
01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
out the form that if they're confined
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
for a felony they're not eligible to
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
request for an absentee ballot and so
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh the purpose of the amendment
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
that I was submitting as well uh bullet
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
number three this deals with uh
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh the text on the absentee ballot
 
01:48:25.709 --> 01:48:25.719 align:start position:0%
request form in section
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
one the text for the second checkoff box
 
01:48:31.149 --> 01:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
is kind of convoluted if you were to
 
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
look at the form it says I here hereby
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
declare that one I am a duly qualified
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
voter who is currently registered to
 
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
vote in this town award and the second
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
check off box is I am absent from the
 
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
town city where I am domiciled and so
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
what I would find as city clerk is a lot
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
of people would automatically just check
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
off the first box and then the second
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
one because they're asking for the
 
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot because they're absent
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh but that second check off box really
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
is intended for people who um are not
 
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
registered to vote and wish to vote
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
absentee so the language of that is
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
proposed to be changed to I am unable to
 
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
register to vote in person because I am
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
absent from the city Town Place or Ward
 
01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
where I I'm domiciled and will be until
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
the next election and and request that
 
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
the forms necessary for absentee voter
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
registration be sent me with me with the
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot um the language change
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
really is just for clarification
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
purposes for the voter and it C it
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
reduces confusion when the city clerks
 
01:49:36.669 --> 01:49:36.679 align:start position:0%
and town clerks receive the forms back
 
01:49:36.679 --> 01:49:38.149 align:start position:0%
and town clerks receive the forms back
to

01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
them um I would also note that I
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
proposed adding the word ward to uh the
 
01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:47.719 align:start position:0%
cluster of words that say I am absent
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
from the city Town unincorporated place
 
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
or Ward where I am domiciled uh in the
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
large cities sometimes it's just as hard
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
to get from one end of the city to the
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
other as it is to get perhaps from
 
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
Hudson to Lichfield and so since it's a
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
separate District voting district uh the
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
request there is to add the word
 
01:50:12.149 --> 01:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
ward um the fourth
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
bullet uh the current absentee ballot
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
request form provides six check off
 
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
boxes for reasons why an absentee ballot
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
may be requested Ed and House Bill 555
 
01:50:27.149 --> 01:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
is providing a seventh uh reason the U
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
Bill proposes that some of these similar
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh reasons for requesting an absentee
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
ballot be clustered together so that now
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
there will only be three check off boxes
 
01:50:39.629 --> 01:50:39.639 align:start position:0%
for the person to choose
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
from um page two lines 13 to 24 that's
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
really just a
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
textual uh grammar change if you will to
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
make the phras is State primary election
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
and state general election parallel and
 
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
the current law one says State primary
 
01:50:59.709 --> 01:50:59.719 align:start position:0%
the other one says general election now
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
they would both say State primary
 
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
election or state general election the
 
01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:06.159 align:start position:0%
other change being made is that the
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
passage dealing with uh for primary
 
01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
elections I am a member of or I am now
 
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
declaring my affiliation with the
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
following Republican or Democratic party
 
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
that language is placed underneath the
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
check off box for State primary election
 
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
instead of appearing under the check off
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
box for state general election uh again
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's just trying to make the form a
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
little easier to understand for the
 
01:51:29.679 --> 01:51:31.350 align:start position:0%
little easier to understand for the
voter

01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
voter
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
um the next change which would be my
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
bullet uh
 
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
six if you look at the bottom of the
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
current absentee ballot request form it
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
says you at the bottom turnover you must
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
complete the back side and when you go
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
to the second side side of the um
 
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form that
 
01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
includes information asking for the
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
applicants email address and the
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
applicant signature certainly that's
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
helpful information for the city and
 
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
town clerks to contact voters if they
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
have any problems with the absentee
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
ballot application uh but technically
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's not a requirement to obtain the
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request form so my
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
proposal is simply to move that those
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
two c s underneath the voter signature
 
01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
and make it clear by adding the word
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
optional that the voter doesn't have to
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
fill that out uh in order to obtain an
 
01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:32.679 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot uh request form and I
 
01:52:34.589 --> 01:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
think it's also more consistent with the
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
recent uh change to our state
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
constitution where voters approved uh a
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
provision that uh really wants the state
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
to minimize the kind of personal
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
information it's collecting and storing
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
um number
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
seven and this pertains to
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
um let's see where click
 
01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
that representative Veron when did you
 
01:53:07.229 --> 01:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
send that email with the amendment I'm
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
not finding it in my email uh last night
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
um it might have
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
been I'll keep
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
looking okay thanks
 
01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.510 align:start position:0%
looking okay thanks
the

01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
um all right I apologize I can't find it
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
quickly either
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
um the next section section seven talks
 
01:53:33.149 --> 01:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
about changing the absentee envelope
 
01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
affidavit if you've seen that affidavit
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's very small type and it has two
 
01:53:39.870 --> 01:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
boxes on it where the individual has to
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
make a decision as to whether or not
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to sign under the section
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
deals absence from city or town or sign
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the section that says absence because
 
01:53:52.109 --> 01:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
of religious observance of or physical
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
disability uh the bill proposes that
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
there only be one box one signoff box
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
essentially the two are combined and the
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
voter simply signs the affidavit
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
envelope um really none of this
 
01:54:08.069 --> 01:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
information is tracked uh if you have a
 
01:54:10.589 --> 01:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
single box and it's combined language
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
presumably the font can be bigger and it
 
01:54:14.589 --> 01:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
would be easier for their voters to read
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
it and also realize that they need to
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
sign the affidavit
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
envelope and then the final change
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed for the absentee
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
ballots appears on page 7 section 3
 
01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:28.109 align:start position:0%
ballots appears on page 7 section 3
Lines

01:54:28.109 --> 01:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
Lines
 
01:54:31.629 --> 01:54:31.639 align:start position:0%
26-34 um the amendment removes the text
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
quote the signatures on the affidavit
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
shall be examined to determine if it
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
appears to be executed executed by the
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
same person who signed the application
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
and in its place language is inserted
 
01:54:45.709 --> 01:54:45.719 align:start position:0%
that states the signature on the
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
affidavit shall be by the same person
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
who signed the application
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment is intended to ensure
 
01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
that a voter's ballot is not rejected
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
due due to a signature mismatch and U
 
01:55:01.069 --> 01:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
that reflects the uh the intent and and
 
01:55:04.750 --> 01:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
the order in the Mary Soo versus William
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
Gardner uh Secretary of State U order um
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
on pages 43 to
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
45 so it's it's it's rather detailed um
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
I apologize if the Committees didn't see
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
or receive the uh
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
my summary of it it is kind of
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
overwhelming considered considering the
 
01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
amount of material that we do receive uh
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
but if the committee has any questions I
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
would be happy to uh to respond thank
 
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Bon representative
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
Wells had the email I just can't find it
 
01:55:38.669 --> 01:55:38.679 align:start position:0%
online so I have forwarded it to myself
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for your explanation
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
because there were a couple of changes
 
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.639 align:start position:0%
you made and I wasn't really quite sure
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
what you were trying to do so you
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
certainly answered some questions for me
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
going through the bill uh questions for
 
01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative perser on on this bill
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:08.069 --> 01:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
electronically I think you sort done so
 
01:56:08.079 --> 01:56:18.189 align:start position:0%
electronically I think you sort done so
much

01:56:18.189 --> 01:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not seeing any questions
 
01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:24.229 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not seeing any questions
from

01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
anybody representative home o'ri just
 
01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
trying to to
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
apologizes

01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
yes 12 it says or I am unable to
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
register vote to vote in person because
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
um does this expand
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
any right that is
 
01:56:55.679 --> 01:56:57.310 align:start position:0%
any right that is
not

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
available no um and in fact that was the
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
one of the purposes of house build 1266
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
which the uh election law committee I
 
01:57:09.069 --> 01:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
believe we passed it unanimously and
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
sent it over to the Senate if you were
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
to look at the actual absentee ballot
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
request form that currently exists that
 
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
sentence is pretty convoluted it's it
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
appears in section one of the absentee
 
01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
ballot form and it currently reads I am
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
absent from the town city where I am
 
01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
domiciled and will be until the next
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
election or I am unable to register in
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
person due to a disability and request
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
that the forms necessary for absentee
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
voter registration be sent to me with
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot so the purpose of
 
01:57:42.669 --> 01:57:42.679 align:start position:0%
that check off box is that your the
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
voter is ask the resident is asking for
 
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
absentee voter registration information
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
to be sent to them but it appears at at
 
01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
the end of a three-line sentence so the
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
voter doesn't really understand what
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
that is all about until they get to the
 
01:57:59.550 --> 01:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
end of the sentence so all I'm doing is
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
suggesting you take the back end of
 
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
what's currently on the form and put it
 
01:58:07.069 --> 01:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
to the front of the phrase so right away
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
the person who's reading it says I am
 
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
unable to register to vote in person
 
01:58:13.149 --> 01:58:13.159 align:start position:0%
because that's what that check off box
 
01:58:15.550 --> 01:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
is for so we're not changing the intent
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
at all we're just kind of restructuring
 
01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
the sentence so that the purpose of that
 
01:58:22.069 --> 01:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
sentence appears at the beginning rather
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
end that's the college composition
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
teacher coming through I'm sorry for
 
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
that representative Moody thank you very
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair and thank you
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time and effort
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
on this sometimes the application and
 
01:58:42.109 --> 01:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
the envelope you have to read almost a
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
few times to really be sure you're
 
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
checking what you're supposed to be
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
checking so it's nice that you put the
 
01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
thought and time into it
 
01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to page
 
01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
seven you have new language there
 
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
talking about uh variation in the
 
01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:00.390 align:start position:0%
talking about uh variation in the
voter's

01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
voter's
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
signatures uh and then further down it
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
says that the moderator shall not reject
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot due to a variation
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
can you explain how that's different
 
01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
from current
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
practice yes it it it goes and and you
 
01:59:18.669 --> 01:59:18.679 align:start position:0%
know this can change because the the
 
01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
legislature has the right to change the
 
01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
laws of course um but this comes from
 
01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
the 2018 decision from uh uh US District
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
Court Mary Solo versus William Gardner
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State uh and that's
 
01:59:38.109 --> 01:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
essentially where the Court ruled that
 
01:59:41.310 --> 01:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
um election officials moderators are not
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
handwriting experts and they shouldn't
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
um reject an absentee ballot a uh
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
at an absentee ballot because the
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
signatures do not appear to be um
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
exactly the same or or strongly s
 
01:59:59.950 --> 01:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
similar uh between what appears on the
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope and the request form
 
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
it was a a similar case although it
 
02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
dealt with petitions in uh nashwa in
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
1998 where the Court's order from
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
Justice delanis actually um said that
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
there are dangers to attempting to
 
02:00:20.669 --> 02:00:20.679 align:start position:0%
compare signatures in the ab absence of
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
handwriting expertise so all this is
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
saying is yeah the voter needs to sign
 
02:00:28.109 --> 02:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
the affidavit we have to have that but
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
the moderator uh is is not to make a
 
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
judgment on whether or not that
 
02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
signature is the exactly the same as the
 
02:00:38.589 --> 02:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
signature that appears on the absentee
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
ballot request form so that was
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
addressed when uh the legislature
 
02:00:47.310 --> 02:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
repealed section I think it was 650
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 uh which was ordered by
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
the court but this piece of language
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
which appeared in 659 52 uh wasn't
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
amended further question I do actually
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh any chance you have a citation on
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
that case or sure the uh US District
 
02:01:12.830 --> 02:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
Court is uh uh civil number
 
02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:14.990 align:start position:0%
Court is uh uh civil number
17-

02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
17-
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
cv-1 183
 
02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
dlm and it was opinion number
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
2018 DNH
 
02:01:27.629 --> 02:01:27.639 align:start position:0%
160 representative berson do you have
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
the spelling of the plaintiff's last
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
name because I think that people will
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
just be able to Google and the case sure
 
02:01:38.430 --> 02:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
that's uh Mary Soo and I may be
 
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.669 --> 02:01:50.679 align:start position:0%
do thank you thanks and the the related
 
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
case although again it deals with
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
petitions but it does deal with
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
handwriting signatures was uh uh 98-
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
E350 Civic nashille Civic form versus
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%

madam chairman repres Senor B thank you
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I have a question
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
relates that relates to I'll call it the
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
weather excuse bottom of page one
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
starting with line 30 yes it currently
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
says that this this option is available
 
02:02:36.069 --> 02:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
only Monday immediately prior to the
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
election we cross that out but
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
also it states cannot appear by pulling
 
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
place an election day because of
 
02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
National Weather Service storm warning
 
02:02:49.950 --> 02:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
Etc but there are two addition
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
conditions uh you need one of which you
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
need to check off one about being elbow
 
02:02:56.069 --> 02:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
or firm or physical disability and
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
worried about your safety the other
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
being that school Child Care adult care
 
02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
will be cancelled so what it appears is
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
happening with this uh change if I
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
understand it right is that you're
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
changing an excuse that depends on the
 
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
weather in some other condition that you
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
experience to Simply an excuse for the
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
weather having been forecast to be B do

welcome thank you madam chair members of
 
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm David scanland deputy
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
secretary of state uh I would like to
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
just recognize I think represent berson
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
did a great job trying to clarify some
 
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
of this uh uh confusing language on the
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
on the application form and the
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
affidavit um and so the the comment that
 
02:04:28.830 --> 02:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to make is not unique to
 
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
represent berson's bill but just in
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
general over the last few bium we have
 
02:04:38.189 --> 02:04:38.199 align:start position:0%
been adding language to uh both the
 
02:04:41.470 --> 02:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
application and the affidavit I think I
 
02:04:43.149 --> 02:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
think in this case representative Bon
 
02:04:45.629 --> 02:04:45.639 align:start position:0%
may have cleaned some of that up but
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
just uh for an example I'm going to put
 
02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
up this is the affid
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
envelope um and you can see that the
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
whole envelope is covered in text uh and
 
02:05:00.549 --> 02:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
signature lines and so at some point uh
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
you know I would like to participate in
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
an exercise uh with your committee where
 
02:05:07.709 --> 02:05:07.719 align:start position:0%
we might try and somehow condense the
 
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
language that goes on uh both the
 
02:05:12.430 --> 02:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
application and the affidavit so that
 
02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
that is simpler and more easily read uh
 
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
by the voter and the election officials
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh maybe it means an accompanying form
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
that defines some of the things that the
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh that the voter is going to sign when
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
they acknowledge the affidavit um I just
 
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
point that out because you know with
 
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
there may be some other bills out there
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
dealing with this language as well and
 
02:05:38.669 --> 02:05:38.679 align:start position:0%
at some point we're just going to have
 
02:05:41.069 --> 02:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
to address the physical space that's
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
required on the fors and the envelope
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%

02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
good job cleaning up some of the
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
language I I wanted to know whether that
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
meant you all were in favor of the bill

um if we are at a point on Monday where
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
it looks like we might be able to exact
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
all bills it would be the chair's
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
preference to continue not to 8 o' at
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
night um but to not quit at 3 o' if it

you um in in college my nickname was uh
 
03:30:22.990 --> 03:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
Harry Snodgrass for a while um Harry is
 
03:30:25.590 --> 03:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
a real life person although we've never
 
03:30:28.990 --> 03:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
met um as St starving college students
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
my group of friends learned that a
 
03:30:32.469 --> 03:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
neighboring College catered Buffet
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
corporate lunches and we learned how to
 
03:30:38.150 --> 03:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
casually walk by the signin desk and
 
03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
surreptitiously glance at remaining name
 
03:30:40.640 --> 03:30:41.590 align:start position:0%
surreptitiously glance at remaining name
tags

03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
tags
 
03:30:43.189 --> 03:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
we would then pick a name from the
 
03:30:45.469 --> 03:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
remaining name tags and return a few
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
minutes and announce
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
ourselves uh and be given the name tag
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
and consequently receive our goal of
 
03:30:53.550 --> 03:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
free all you can eat cater
 
03:30:56.590 --> 03:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
food um the last time we worked this
 
03:30:59.670 --> 03:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
scam Harry Snodgrass was the only
 
03:31:01.990 --> 03:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
remaining male name and so I became
 
03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:03.309 align:start position:0%
remaining male name and so I became
Harry

03:31:03.309 --> 03:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
Harry
 
03:31:06.269 --> 03:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
Snodgrass um I believe we have a similar
 
03:31:09.229 --> 03:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
scam possible in New Hampshire elections
 
03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
with mail in absentee ballots
 
03:31:14.950 --> 03:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
and lots of Harry snod grasses that is
 
03:31:17.830 --> 03:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
people who didn't show up to vote
 
03:31:20.429 --> 03:31:20.439 align:start position:0%
specifically I will be discussing mailin
 
03:31:23.710 --> 03:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot requests and even more
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
specifically those requests asking that
 
03:31:28.750 --> 03:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
their ballot be mailed to an address
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
other than the verified address shown in
 
03:31:30.960 --> 03:31:31.990 align:start position:0%
other than the verified address shown in
the

03:31:31.990 --> 03:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:31:34.750 --> 03:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
checklist there are three key points to
 
03:31:34.760 --> 03:31:36.070 align:start position:0%
checklist there are three key points to
this

03:31:36.070 --> 03:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:31:39.710 --> 03:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
discussion one mailed in absentee ballot
 
03:31:41.630 --> 03:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
requests are the only only method of
 
03:31:43.510 --> 03:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire that doesn't
 
03:31:46.030 --> 03:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
require any positive
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
identification to be clear in New
 
03:31:50.910 --> 03:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently if I know Harry
 
03:31:54.309 --> 03:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
Snodgrass exists on a voter checklist I
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
can simply declare myself to be Harry
 
03:31:58.910 --> 03:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
Snodgrass and request to have a Harry
 
03:32:02.189 --> 03:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
Snodgrass absentee ballot mailed to me
 
03:32:05.150 --> 03:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
at any address inside the United States
 
03:32:08.189 --> 03:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
and raise not a single eyebrow or red
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
flag a clerk may even know Harry but he
 
03:32:15.189 --> 03:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
or she doesn't have a single ability to
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
question whether I am Harry Snodgrass or
 
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
not two it is remarkably easy to create
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
lists of names of Harry snodgres in New
 
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is those who most
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
probably will not show up at the polls
 
03:32:35.670 --> 03:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
and claim their own vote I know of three
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
possible ways to build a checklist of
 
03:32:40.830 --> 03:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of possible Harry snod grasses
 
03:32:42.550 --> 03:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure there are more ways than
 
03:32:44.110 --> 03:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
the ones I thought
 
03:32:47.229 --> 03:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
of if they do show up at the polls more
 
03:32:49.469 --> 03:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
likely than not the checkin people will
 
03:32:51.910 --> 03:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
assume it was a mistake and they make up
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
a new name tag for
 
03:32:58.269 --> 03:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
Harry three almost no person I've ever
 
03:33:01.670 --> 03:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
met who has chosen not to vote will ever
 
03:33:03.630 --> 03:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
take the time to do the research with
 
03:33:06.389 --> 03:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
their own town clerk to see if anyone
 
03:33:08.110 --> 03:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
claiming to be Harry
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
Snodgrass themselves took their B and
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
voted in their name by
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
absentee as a side note even if they did
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's written off as an error of some
 
03:33:20.830 --> 03:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
kind and never investigated so this is a
 
03:33:24.830 --> 03:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
crime that goes undetected or
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
unexamined Harry snod grass's ballot
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
Gets In The Ballot Box and Harry
 
03:33:32.189 --> 03:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
probably never knows it this is a very
 
03:33:35.150 --> 03:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
bad situation in New Hampshire imagine
 
03:33:38.189 --> 03:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
for a second if we had some a situation
 
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
where someone anyone could walk in into
 
03:33:44.229 --> 03:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
TD Bank and claim to be Harry Snodgrass
 
03:33:46.110 --> 03:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
and asked for all the money in Harry
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
Snodgrass his bank account or
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
Worse what is what is more valuable than
 
03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
a person's vote but it's worse if
 
03:33:57.550 --> 03:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
somebody could mail in a letter saying
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
in the mail just mail me the money in
 
03:34:04.630 --> 03:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
account number 1234 I am Harry snod
 
03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
can't shouldn't be
 
03:34:09.630 --> 03:34:09.640 align:start position:0%
done this bill protects both Harry and
 
03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
Harry's vote
 
03:34:14.830 --> 03:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
um it requires a copy of Harry's ID or
 
03:34:17.710 --> 03:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
notorized signature to obtain Harry's
 
03:34:20.550 --> 03:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
ballot under those specific conditions
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
or assigned challenged at voter
 
03:34:27.030 --> 03:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit and this this only applies
 
03:34:29.510 --> 03:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
when the ballot is requested by mail and
 
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
when the ballot is mailed to an address
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
other than the addressing record on the
 
03:34:36.349 --> 03:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
checklist there is an amendment that was
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
sent to the committee uh this morning at
 
03:34:41.229 --> 03:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
8:49 a.m. by
 
03:34:45.309 --> 03:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
s um they actually contacted me and said
 
03:34:49.070 --> 03:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
that the um original drafting did not
 
03:34:52.150 --> 03:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
include all of the options that I had
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
originally requested so the amendment uh
 
03:35:00.510 --> 03:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
the current bill as it shows um uh an A
 
03:35:03.309 --> 03:35:03.319 align:start position:0%
and A B for the voter voluntarily shows
 
03:35:06.150 --> 03:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
a clerk a photo ID meets the
 
03:35:08.349 --> 03:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
requirements of RSA
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
659 and B the voter voluntarily includes
 
03:35:14.389 --> 03:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
a notorized signature on his or her
 
03:35:17.269 --> 03:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
completed absentee ballot form the
 
03:35:20.429 --> 03:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
corrected version is the voter
 
03:35:23.229 --> 03:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
voluntarily includes with the returned
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot to the clerk a copy of
 
03:35:28.510 --> 03:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
their photo identification that meets
 
03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
the requirements of RSA 1
 
03:35:35.150 --> 03:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
659 B the voter voluntarily completes a
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
challenge voter affidavit in the same
 
03:35:39.550 --> 03:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
manner as required for an election day
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
voter who who does not present a
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
qualified voter identification or C the
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
voter voluntarily includes a notorized
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
signature on his or her completed
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
absolute absentee ballot application
 
03:35:57.309 --> 03:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
form and that's the only difference from
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
in in the amendment it it gives another
 
03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
option it gives that uh that option of
 
03:36:06.429 --> 03:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
the challenge voter affidavit and it
 
03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
also U changes from the giving the clerk
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
a photo identification to the photo
 
03:36:15.590 --> 03:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
identification is a copy that is sent in
 
03:36:18.990 --> 03:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
with their with their absente valot with
 
03:36:20.950 --> 03:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
that I'll close my testimony I'm happy
 
03:36:22.910 --> 03:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that the
 
03:36:25.429 --> 03:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
committee has um I'm not sure the
 
03:36:27.229 --> 03:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
procedure of getting this
 
03:36:29.950 --> 03:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to you all I assume it's
 
03:36:32.229 --> 03:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
already there I just have not figured
 
03:36:35.229 --> 03:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
out that system yet I I just before we
 
03:36:37.750 --> 03:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
take questions um I just looked I did
 
03:36:39.150 --> 03:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
not find it but I'm not finding things
 
03:36:41.750 --> 03:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
in my email this is the second on today
 
03:36:44.590 --> 03:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to assume it has it
 
03:36:47.830 --> 03:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
and I told someone this for a hearing
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow executive session if you want
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment consider find somebody on
 
03:36:55.389 --> 03:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
the to introduce it and it will be
 
03:36:57.670 --> 03:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
considered anybody have questions for
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%

committee I do not know the level of
 
03:38:13.630 --> 03:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
occurrence during an election cycle that
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot applicant requests
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
his or her ballot be returned to an
 
03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
address inconsistent with that shown on
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot application form a
 
03:38:27.389 --> 03:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
number likely known to the prime

03:38:39.750 --> 03:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I speak to the worth of signature

sorry I speak to the worth of signature

of a friend who was unable to navigate

uh the website um we're both over 12 so

it's difficult for both of
 
03:42:07.550 --> 03:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
us being kind to many of us Mr

Perry all right I'll I'll allow you to
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
I've got other people here signed up to
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
speak but why don't you read the
 
03:42:14.950 --> 03:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
person's name into the record and go
 
03:42:17.950 --> 03:42:17.960 align:start position:0%

ma'am to house election law Kitty uh
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
03:42:25.590 --> 03:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
to provide written testimony on House
 
03:42:28.269 --> 03:42:28.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 292 which establishes procedures
 
03:42:30.429 --> 03:42:30.439 align:start position:0%
relative to the absentee ballot
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
application process including signature
 
03:42:36.389 --> 03:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
comparison I oppose passage of this bill
 
03:42:38.070 --> 03:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
because the provision that requires the
 
03:42:40.429 --> 03:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
comparison of the voters signat would
 
03:42:43.389 --> 03:42:43.399 align:start position:0%
provide an undue burden on people with
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
certain disabilities such as multiple
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
sclerosis I have MS and have lived with
 
03:42:53.030 --> 03:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
it for decades however it took many
 
03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
years dealing with a range of
 
03:42:57.030 --> 03:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
frustrating episodic
 
03:43:01.110 --> 03:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
symptoms before I got a definitive
 
03:43:04.469 --> 03:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
diagnosis around a year before a neur a
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
urologist told me I had Ms I found
 
03:43:10.910 --> 03:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
myself in Las Vegas on a business trip
 
03:43:13.110 --> 03:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
on my last day there I was not feeling
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
well and decided to rest in the Sun by
 
03:43:16.469 --> 03:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
the swimming pool before I packed and
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
checked out of the hotel not a good idea
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
because heat exacerbates MS symptoms
 
03:43:25.070 --> 03:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
after 30 minutes in the heat my hands
 
03:43:28.149 --> 03:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
and lower limbs became tingly and stiff
 
03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
and my gate became unsteady and I had no
 
03:43:33.309 --> 03:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
idea why when I went to check out I
 
03:43:35.790 --> 03:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
presented my credit card and signed the
 
03:43:38.429 --> 03:43:38.439 align:start position:0%
statement the employee behind the desk
 
03:43:42.030 --> 03:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
refused to accept my cad and said the
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
signatures did not
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
match I asked to speak to the manager
 
03:43:49.630 --> 03:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
and was told by management that they had
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
to be careful for fraudulent cards in a
 
03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
city like Las Vegas I was already
 
03:43:57.550 --> 03:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
feeling ill and the rejection of my card
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
only added to my stress I had to find a
 
03:44:02.950 --> 03:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
co-worker and then my supervisor to
 
03:44:05.710 --> 03:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
vouch for me before I could get my card
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
back complete the transaction and get to
 
03:44:11.670 --> 03:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
the airport in time for my return flight
 
03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
I wanted to share this story with the
 
03:44:14.550 --> 03:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
committee because it illustrates how
 
03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
certain illnesses can impair one's hand
 
03:44:21.550 --> 03:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
dexterity and change one's
 
03:44:24.189 --> 03:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
signature there are many people who have
 
03:44:28.510 --> 03:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
MS and do not know it and some never get
 
03:44:28.520 --> 03:44:30.309 align:start position:0%
MS and do not know it and some never get
a

03:44:30.309 --> 03:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:44:32.590 --> 03:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
diagnosis by the way in my case I
 
03:44:34.990 --> 03:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
experienced symptoms in my extremities
 
03:44:37.870 --> 03:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
with each exacerbation including on one
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
occasion loss of use of my right hand
 
03:44:44.349 --> 03:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
hand for a period of weeks I urge the
 
03:44:45.830 --> 03:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee to take my story into
 
03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
consideration in your deliberations and
 
03:44:48.560 --> 03:44:50.429 align:start position:0%
consideration in your deliberations and
vote

03:44:50.429 --> 03:44:50.439 align:start position:0%

anybody have any questions for Mr Perry
 
03:45:18.269 --> 03:45:18.279 align:start position:0%
anybody attending online have any
 
03:45:20.429 --> 03:45:20.439 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
03:45:23.309 --> 03:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
per I'm
 
03:45:28.229 --> 03:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
not representative Brian thank you madam
 
03:45:30.630 --> 03:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
chair lost here and i' like some
 
03:45:34.110 --> 03:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
clarification perhaps from the author
 
03:45:37.149 --> 03:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
Bill about current law
 
03:45:40.149 --> 03:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
versus what section two and what section
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
03:45:46.830 --> 03:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
some uh representative I are you
 
03:45:51.790 --> 03:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
referring to a and b in the
 
03:45:55.830 --> 03:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh section two starting on line 12
 
03:45:59.189 --> 03:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
section three
 
03:46:04.149 --> 03:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
stud 16 I would just like that clarified
 
03:46:06.269 --> 03:46:06.279 align:start position:0%
and also how it compares to current law
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
so yes I'm I'm asking the the author of
 
03:46:13.349 --> 03:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
the bill here in the room us
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm just a
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
little lost here you're talking
 
03:46:22.189 --> 03:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
about verification just like
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.510 --> 03:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
law if you can answer Mr Perry yes I I'm
 
03:46:33.630 --> 03:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
I'm actually having trouble hearing but
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that signature
 
03:46:38.830 --> 03:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
comparison um is at least temporarily on
 
03:46:38.840 --> 03:46:40.349 align:start position:0%
comparison um is at least temporarily on
hold

03:46:40.349 --> 03:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
hold
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh and to be honest I don't know whether
 
03:46:45.189 --> 03:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
that is a ruling uh within the state
 
03:46:46.910 --> 03:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
court or the federal
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
courts um but uh obviously in some
 
03:46:51.990 --> 03:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
states there are requirements for
 
03:46:54.750 --> 03:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
Signature match and I I think it's
 
03:46:58.790 --> 03:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh very troubling place to be okay thank
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
you you only have to answer what you're
 
03:47:01.950 --> 03:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
sure you know Mr Perry don't worry about
 
03:47:06.630 --> 03:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
it thank you um representative toosan
 
03:47:08.469 --> 03:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you Mr Perry
 
03:47:10.269 --> 03:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
in regard to theory of people you
 
03:47:16.830 --> 03:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
described um would not a
 
03:47:19.950 --> 03:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
solution to that um signature
 
03:47:23.149 --> 03:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
verification B if they would comply with
 
03:47:26.710 --> 03:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
um part A and B of this proposed
 
03:47:28.590 --> 03:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
legislation are you familiar with what
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
those say I'd be glad to read them if
 
03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
you're not no I have that in front of me
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative and yes it surely would
 
03:47:39.550 --> 03:47:39.560 align:start position:0%
but those um reliefs are not available
 
03:47:39.560 --> 03:47:40.429 align:start position:0%
but those um reliefs are not available
to

03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%

the verification items in A and B and if
 
03:48:10.110 --> 03:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
we don't use signature
 
03:48:13.790 --> 03:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
you have thoughts on how we can assure
 
03:48:17.469 --> 03:48:17.479 align:start position:0%
that the applicant for a an absentee
 
03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
ballot is truly the person that he or
 
03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
she says they
 
03:48:24.750 --> 03:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
are well there are several options
 
03:48:27.070 --> 03:48:27.080 align:start position:0%

qualified voter

know that um the Attorney General's
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%

elaborate on how that would alleviate
the

03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:05.670 --> 03:49:05.680 align:start position:0%

representing is America votes I'm here
 
03:50:07.349 --> 03:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to House Bill 292 um
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to talk about a little bit
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
some the voters that we're probably
 
03:50:13.510 --> 03:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
talking about this lot impacting so uh
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
for those folks who don't fully
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
understand so there's a group a really
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
sort of three groups that pop into my
 
03:50:21.389 --> 03:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
head of Voters who will request a ballot
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
um from a domiciled address uh their
 
03:50:25.110 --> 03:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
voter domicile being different from
 
03:50:27.269 --> 03:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
their request the ballot uh certainly
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
snowbirds folks who live um in uh
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
Florida or Arizona or somewhere else for
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
a portion of the Year may fall into that
 
03:50:37.990 --> 03:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
category uh a student who lives grew up
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and goes to college in
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
a different state would fall into that
 
03:50:42.670 --> 03:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
category and then lastly and I think the
 
03:50:44.309 --> 03:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
one that we should be most careful about
 
03:50:46.590 --> 03:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
as we we talk about this bill is folks
 
03:50:49.070 --> 03:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
who live in nursing homes um who still
 
03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
have the ability to vote at their
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
previous domicile um but live in the
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
nursing home so for that voter in
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
particular what we're now asking and I
 
03:50:58.469 --> 03:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
don't have the amendment in front of me
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
and so um it's obviously a little
 
03:51:02.790 --> 03:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
different than the bill um but what we
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
are now asking is that they uh do one of
 
03:51:08.750 --> 03:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
these things that is after mentioned
 
03:51:09.990 --> 03:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're asking someone who lives in a
 
03:51:12.269 --> 03:51:12.279 align:start position:0%
nursing home to uh show up at their town
 
03:51:13.830 --> 03:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
hall or we're asking them to get a
 
03:51:16.229 --> 03:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
notorized signature um and if not we're
 
03:51:17.790 --> 03:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
asking them to Signature mismatch which
 
03:51:20.189 --> 03:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
as we learned this morning as uh Mr
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
Perry alluded to in the previous
 
03:51:24.710 --> 03:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
testimony um is currently illegal in the
 
03:51:27.950 --> 03:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um so now what
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
you're saying since we know part three
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
of this bill doesn't work um or isn't is
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
illegal at the moment um that you're
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
leaving two voluntary measures um
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
left on the book so so a law without
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement effectively um is what you
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
would be passing into law I do worry um
 
03:51:49.750 --> 03:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
I know it's been mentioned a lot this
 
03:51:52.750 --> 03:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
morning that there is no uh mandated
 
03:51:54.670 --> 03:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
verification uh for someone who drops
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
off an absente ballot uh into town hall
 
03:51:59.710 --> 03:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of town clerks who do a
 
03:52:02.189 --> 03:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
request and ask for their photo ID even
 
03:52:03.590 --> 03:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
though it's just voluntary within the
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
law um and I worry that making voluntary
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
quote unquote voluntary laws uh will
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
become mandates uh based on the local
 
03:52:13.670 --> 03:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
level which can cause certainly
 
03:52:17.070 --> 03:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
confusion um throughout the state so uh
 
03:52:18.550 --> 03:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to this bill uh for a
 
03:52:20.110 --> 03:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons I will say on a
 
03:52:24.349 --> 03:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
personal note um my father uh has Ms he
 
03:52:25.870 --> 03:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with multiple sceris in
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
1978 he's lived with it now um he blames
 
03:52:31.229 --> 03:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
Bucky Dent hitting that home run uh for
 
03:52:33.750 --> 03:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
the reason he got Ms in the first place
 
03:52:36.110 --> 03:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and he's lived with it for you know
 
03:52:38.550 --> 03:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
40 years um and Ms affects his
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
day-to-day life uh in ways that I've
 
03:52:43.790 --> 03:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
certainly seen growing up um and but are
 
03:52:45.670 --> 03:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
unimaginable to me without seeing a
 
03:52:48.429 --> 03:52:48.439 align:start position:0%
day-to-day and um certainly that
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
provision that part um inspires a lot of
 
03:52:53.550 --> 03:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
nervousness within me because of that
 
03:52:55.189 --> 03:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
and knowing that I'm happy to take any
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
292 again my name is Janice Kelby and I
 
03:53:49.269 --> 03:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
live in hooks at New Hampshire it's my
 
03:53:50.990 --> 03:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that voters can vote from
 
03:53:52.870 --> 03:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
an address where they live before
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
entering a nursing home my husband and I
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
lived in a home that we bought in
 
03:54:00.110 --> 03:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
Franklin New Hampshire and we lived
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
there for nearly 20 years when he was
 
03:54:04.110 --> 03:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
finally forced to receive care in a
 
03:54:06.830 --> 03:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
nursing home outside of Franklin for a
 
03:54:09.309 --> 03:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
couple of years I can speak of
 
03:54:11.550 --> 03:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
experiences at both of those
 
03:54:14.469 --> 03:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
places um that my husband who suffered
 
03:54:16.630 --> 03:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
from Parkinson's and he spent time in
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
two different nursing homes both of them
 
03:54:21.870 --> 03:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
were not in Franklin in the first home
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
he was in it was probably no that anyone
 
03:54:26.950 --> 03:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
would have made any effort to assist him
 
03:54:29.950 --> 03:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
with needs of having somebody come in to
 
03:54:32.830 --> 03:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
notarize a ballot we were frankly pretty
 
03:54:35.550 --> 03:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
lucky when they had sufficient staff to
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
take care of his basic medical needs in
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
the second home I'm fairly confident
 
03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
they would likely have made a great
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
effort to make the arrangements for a
 
03:54:47.229 --> 03:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
notary to be available to assist him
 
03:54:50.189 --> 03:54:50.199 align:start position:0%
based on Staffing ability communication
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
and the time frame they would have to
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
allow him to have it done in a timely
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
manner to have him safely return his
 
03:55:01.590 --> 03:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
ballot it may or may not happen but him
 
03:55:04.149 --> 03:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
being able to have a voice shouldn't be
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
dependent on another person if he was if
 
03:55:09.950 --> 03:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
they were not able to meet that time
 
03:55:12.189 --> 03:55:12.199 align:start position:0%
constraint and his needs it would have
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
placed a burden on him that would have
 
03:55:17.750 --> 03:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
resulted in him losing his right to vote
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
which was always important to him and
 
03:55:22.030 --> 03:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
was always a source of Pride to him
 
03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
sadly his condition in Mobility had
 
03:55:26.469 --> 03:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
worsened to the point that I could no
 
03:55:28.469 --> 03:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
longer take him out of the nursing home
 
03:55:31.630 --> 03:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
on my own to go get a signature
 
03:55:34.670 --> 03:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
notorized the last attempt I made to
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
take him out of the nursing home was to
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
a Parkinson support group that he loved
 
03:55:42.750 --> 03:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
and it took three people to safely get
 
03:55:45.870 --> 03:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
him out of my car and into a wheelchair
 
03:55:47.790 --> 03:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
fortunately there were medical people
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
there to assist me but without that help
 
03:55:53.309 --> 03:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I would have done so
 
03:55:56.070 --> 03:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's not something we can take for
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
granted that something that may be easy
 
03:56:02.070 --> 03:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
for you or I to do might not be so easy
 
03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
for somebody else to do I think it puts
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on people who are often
 
03:56:09.870 --> 03:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
the least able to afford that bur I'd
 
03:56:12.070 --> 03:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
like to add a very real story that is
 
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
the story of my attempts to get
 
03:56:17.469 --> 03:56:17.479 align:start position:0%
signatures which I understand right now
 
03:56:21.149 --> 03:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
that's not legal anyway but if it were
 
03:56:23.910 --> 03:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a very good test Parkinson's is
 
03:56:26.710 --> 03:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
a progressive disease my husband had it
 
03:56:31.389 --> 03:56:31.399 align:start position:0%
for 27 years before he died last year
 
03:56:35.790 --> 03:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
but um getting his signature on legal
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
documents where I needed it was a true
 
03:56:41.910 --> 03:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
test in patience and trying to allow my
 
03:56:45.590 --> 03:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
husband to retain any bit of his dignity
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
and I can honestly tell you that when a
 
03:56:52.710 --> 03:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
Parkinson's person some takes medication
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
they have periods when they're off and
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
they have periods that were on I could
 
03:57:00.670 --> 03:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
get I sometimes got his signature five
 
03:57:03.870 --> 03:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
or six times in a day trying to get one
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
I'd make five copies of something and
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
hope that one of them would reasonably
 
03:57:12.349 --> 03:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
like the signature of the man that I
 
03:57:16.229 --> 03:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
married so that whoever I needed it for
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
for a legal document would think that it
 
03:57:20.590 --> 03:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't something that I chicken
 
03:57:23.110 --> 03:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
scratched honestly I could have signed
 
03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
his name to look like his voter
 
03:57:28.349 --> 03:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
registration name a lot easier than he
 
03:57:30.309 --> 03:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
could you would never have matched the
 
03:57:32.670 --> 03:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
two signatures in fact I doubt if you
 
03:57:35.630 --> 03:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
would have matched a signature from him
 
03:57:38.910 --> 03:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
at 10:00 a.m with a signature for him at
 
03:57:42.229 --> 03:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
3 pm so I just think that these are
 
03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
unfair burdens to place on somebody who
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
can least afford additional burdens in
 
03:57:50.149 --> 03:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
their life thank
 
03:57:53.710 --> 03:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
m by Wayman Griffin had to step out
 
03:57:57.239 --> 03:57:58.790 align:start position:0%
m by Wayman Griffin had to step out
briefly

03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
03:58:02.110 --> 03:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
so Vice chairman of the committee andary
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
pH temporarily filling in are there any
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions from M Kelby from those
 
03:58:11.830 --> 03:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:15.429 --> 03:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
room anyone on uh online any of the
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
committee members observing to zoom any
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:23.630 --> 03:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
this seeing none again thank you very
 
03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
you okay no one else has signed up to
 
03:58:32.990 --> 03:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
speak on this particular piece of
 
03:58:35.910 --> 03:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislation uh is there anyone uh who
 
03:58:39.550 --> 03:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
would like to um we have not called upon
 
03:58:39.560 --> 03:58:40.710 align:start position:0%
would like to um we have not called upon
as

03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:58:44.269 --> 03:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
yet can I can I clarify something Mr
 
03:58:49.269 --> 03:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
sure so Hill thank you uh Mr Mr chairman
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
um if you look at uh lines one and two
 
03:58:55.590 --> 03:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill um where it indicates that
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
this new section is being inserted after
 
03:58:59.760 --> 03:59:03.590 align:start position:0%
this new section is being inserted after
section

03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
17A the what what OS did was simply copy
 
03:59:11.389 --> 03:59:11.399 align:start position:0%
the language from 17A which is
 
03:59:15.670 --> 03:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
existing language and that's where the
 
03:59:17.630 --> 03:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
signature guarantee part that they're
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
talking about in in Roman numeral 3
 
03:59:23.309 --> 03:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's where it already exists so what
 
03:59:26.189 --> 03:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
they're talking about is is already
 
03:59:28.590 --> 03:59:28.600 align:start position:0%
existing law as far as signature
 
03:59:32.110 --> 03:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
guarantee it has nothing to do with this
 
03:59:34.110 --> 03:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
new section that's
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
being being completed does that make
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:39.229 align:start position:0%
being being completed does that make
sense

03:59:39.229 --> 03:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're you're they just
 
03:59:45.950 --> 03:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
transposed a uh 17A into into 17b and
 
03:59:48.389 --> 03:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
then they Chang this language just
 
03:59:52.269 --> 03:59:52.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with um mail in absentee voters
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
so the signature comparison that's
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
already in law that's already a subject
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
of of discussion but it has nothing to
 
04:00:04.830 --> 04:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
do with with what this bill
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
does that's all thank you for that
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you
 
04:00:12.189 --> 04:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
04:00:16.389 --> 04:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
yes U thank you chairman uh
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative Hill so do I understand
 
04:00:22.030 --> 04:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
correctly then that that of this bill
 
04:00:24.149 --> 04:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
section one is what's being changed in
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
section two and three are in existing
 
04:00:31.469 --> 04:00:31.479 align:start position:0%
law already that is correct thank
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
you any other questions yes represent
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:37.319 --> 04:00:38.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
sir

04:00:38.910 --> 04:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:00:38.920 --> 04:00:39.790 align:start position:0%
sir
are

04:00:39.790 --> 04:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
there concerns that you have about
 
04:00:48.309 --> 04:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:48.319 --> 04:00:50.349 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:00:50.349 --> 04:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question
 
04:00:56.149 --> 04:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative um I always have concerns
 
04:00:59.149 --> 04:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
about ballot harvesting um this bill
 
04:00:59.159 --> 04:00:59.950 align:start position:0%
about ballot harvesting um this bill
would

04:00:59.950 --> 04:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:01:04.950 --> 04:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
certainly um lend an air of um
 
04:01:09.189 --> 04:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
reliability if if a town can certainly
 
04:01:13.389 --> 04:01:13.399 align:start position:0%
know at this point um whether the
 
04:01:16.590 --> 04:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
request that comes in by mail is
 
04:01:20.149 --> 04:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
actually being uh requested by the
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
person um that shows up on that
 
04:01:27.189 --> 04:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
checklist um currently um you know I
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
have my town clerk who will say but I
 
04:01:33.269 --> 04:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
know every single person in the town
 
04:01:36.030 --> 04:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
that's requesting the absentee ballots
 
04:01:38.309 --> 04:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
and I'll say well that's great you may
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
know that person but you don't know that
 
04:01:42.670 --> 04:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
it's that person that is doing the
 
04:01:46.389 --> 04:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
requesting it may be um you know Peggy
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
in Islamabad that's doing the requesting
 
04:01:52.510 --> 04:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
for someone um in town that you have no
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
idea and and she will finally we have to
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
agree to disagree um because she feels
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
that she knows every single person so in
 
04:02:04.830 --> 04:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
that way yes ballot harvesting I think
 
04:02:05.790 --> 04:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:02:08.429 --> 04:02:08.439 align:start position:0%
limited thank you for your question
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else have a question on
 
04:02:13.750 --> 04:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
the committee for representative Hill
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
yes um representative blae you have your
 
04:02:21.030 --> 04:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
hand up yes thank you um representative
 
04:02:24.870 --> 04:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
Hill as I think someone pointed out um
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
there is a provision now that is a
 
04:02:30.950 --> 04:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
felony to do this H fraud that you're so
 
04:02:33.070 --> 04:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about do you not feel that
 
04:02:36.149 --> 04:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
that's sufficient to deter
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
fraud thank you for your question
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
um I um I do not feel that that is uh
 
04:02:46.710 --> 04:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
sufficient and for the reason that this
 
04:02:50.710 --> 04:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
is a very difficult um situation to
 
04:02:52.910 --> 04:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
determine uh for the reasons that I
 
04:02:57.790 --> 04:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
stated that um very few people ever
 
04:03:00.750 --> 04:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
don't vote in an election and then go
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
back to check to the the checklist used
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
on the day of the election to determine
 
04:03:10.750 --> 04:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
whether someone voted their ballot um it
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
it goes
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
undetectable um and that's part of the
 
04:03:17.710 --> 04:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
concern I have and part of the reason
 
04:03:20.349 --> 04:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
that I filed the bill that you will hear
 
04:03:23.110 --> 04:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
after the next one which uh in sequence
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
was really supposed to go first which
 
04:03:27.149 --> 04:03:27.159 align:start position:0%
was House Bill
 
04:03:30.269 --> 04:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
291 um so I think I can probably answer
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:37.080 --> 04:03:39.349 align:start position:0%
 
concern

04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you you thank you anyone else with
 
04:03:43.199 --> 04:03:44.830 align:start position:0%
thank you you thank you anyone else with
a

04:03:44.830 --> 04:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
question committee room anyone on Zoom
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:52.910 --> 04:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you kindly Mr chair
 
04:03:56.149 --> 04:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
I um wanted to inquire about um The
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
Proposition that this uh well really the
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
combined proposition that this kind of
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
fraud is rampant on one hand and
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
entirely undetected on the other and um
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I wondered if there's you know if
 
04:04:11.070 --> 04:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
there is any positive evidence that the
 
04:04:14.149 --> 04:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
incidence of this fraud is
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
significant um thank you for your
 
04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
question I um I am in no way um
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this is rampant I'm
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
saying the possibility um is very easy
 
04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
for someone who isn't as bright as me um
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
if I can figure out how I would build a
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
list of names of people that um probably
 
04:04:41.870 --> 04:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
will not be voting in the next election
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
and I have figured out how it is
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
possible for for someone to request
 
04:04:51.950 --> 04:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots by mail for that
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
specific person on those list that I
 
04:04:57.550 --> 04:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
could build and have that ballot mailed
 
04:05:00.510 --> 04:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the United States and have
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
very little chance of detection I think
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
it is something that we need to be
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
concerned with and I think it's
 
04:05:11.070 --> 04:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
something that we can uh with very minor
 
04:05:15.070 --> 04:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh tweaks to the existing law uh I think
 
04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
we can um alleviate the concern or at
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
least mitigate the discern so that would
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
be my answer to your question thank you
 
04:05:26.110 --> 04:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
sir thank
 
04:05:28.710 --> 04:05:28.720 align:start position:0%

327 requiring the voters show
 
04:06:16.750 --> 04:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
identification and personally delivering
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
absente ballot to and city clerk
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative the prime sponsor on this
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
legislation like
 
04:06:29.590 --> 04:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
to thank you
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
sir thank you members of my favorite
 
04:06:33.960 --> 04:06:35.870 align:start position:0%
sir thank you members of my favorite
committee

04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill was was brought to my
 
04:06:42.110 --> 04:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
attention during uh this year when we
 
04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
had a lot of the uh pre-processing of
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
absente ballots our town clerk mentioned
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
to me um that it would be you know more
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
consistent if uh those who were dropping
 
04:06:59.189 --> 04:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
off I'm sorry the town moderator not
 
04:07:01.830 --> 04:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
sorry uh if those who were dropping off
 
04:07:05.189 --> 04:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots in person were also
 
04:07:09.550 --> 04:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
required to show ID just as people who
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
vote in person show
 
04:07:18.269 --> 04:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
ID so um that's why this this bill was
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
drafted and I tried to come up with a
 
04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
way that uh would be simple and easy to
 
04:07:29.830 --> 04:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
um Implement in real life so um this is
 
04:07:32.670 --> 04:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
why it says that the clerk shall Mark
 
04:07:35.429 --> 04:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot affidavit envelope
 
04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
with the notation AIP PS appeared in
 
04:07:43.349 --> 04:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
person ID shown and voter verified and
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
note on the clerk's list of absentee
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
voters that the voter has been verified
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
the verified voter signatures on the
 
04:07:51.309 --> 04:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
application for the absentee ballot
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
shall not be compared to the voter
 
04:07:54.990 --> 04:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
signature on the absent ballot affidavit
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
on Election Day and of course that's out
 
04:07:59.790 --> 04:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
of reflection of the 2018 ruling that we
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier today
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
and uh I am open for questions I think
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
this is pretty simple
 
04:08:12.149 --> 04:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
itself okay questions for
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative thank
 
04:08:15.670 --> 04:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
04:08:17.910 --> 04:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
so basically what this legislation will
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
do is bring in to agreement the
 
04:08:27.630 --> 04:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
requirement to
 
04:08:27.640 --> 04:08:29.590 align:start position:0%
requirement to
show

04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
show
 
04:08:31.469 --> 04:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
identification uh like you have to do
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
now if you come in to vote in person
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
simply that same requirement that exists
 
04:08:41.149 --> 04:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
for drop off youram ballot
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%

O'Brien and this isn't directed on your
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment which is very minor um the
 
04:09:06.309 --> 04:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
original text of the law the statute
 
04:09:08.469 --> 04:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
says the clerk shall mark the absentee
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
ballot affidavit
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
envelope um there's another provision in
 
04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
state law
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
6578 which says all such envelopes shall
 
04:09:21.550 --> 04:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
be preserved unopened until Election Day
 
04:09:23.109 --> 04:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
do you know how the clerks are handling
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
this now if they're not supposed to be
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
opening the outer envelope to get to the
 
04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope are they actually
 
04:09:30.189 --> 04:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
doing that or are they making the
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
notation on the outer envelope that's
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
delivered to the uh town clerk's
 
04:09:41.670 --> 04:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
office I'm not really sure um
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
what as it's listed it's the affidavit
 
04:09:46.510 --> 04:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
envelope that would be
 
04:09:48.870 --> 04:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
marked yes yeah that's what the current
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
law says I'm I'm just confused I I I'll
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
ask some questions it doesn't take away
 
04:09:55.870 --> 04:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
from what you're proposing I'm just uh
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if the existing statute might
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
also need to be slightly uh
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
amended but thank you very much thank
 
04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
you I will I will think of that thank
 
04:10:05.520 --> 04:10:06.429 align:start position:0%
you I will I will think of that thank
you

04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%

04:10:06.439 --> 04:10:08.070 align:start position:0%
you
sir

04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:10:08.080 --> 04:10:09.710 align:start position:0%
sir
representative

04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
Lane um thank you uh what if they do not
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
have ID um and as a followup would we
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
allow them to do an affidavit the way we
 
04:10:30.389 --> 04:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:32.790 --> 04:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
person thank you representative Lane
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
question I think that um they would be
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
treated the same as if they did not have
 
04:10:41.710 --> 04:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
ID when they arrived at the polling
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
place no
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
yes now my my just to add to that my um
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
Town moderator did ask people when when
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
they had not filled things out correctly
 
04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh she did let them know and was able to
 
04:11:01.870 --> 04:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
alert a few people that they had not
 
04:11:03.830 --> 04:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
filled out their their ballots correctly
 
04:11:06.109 --> 04:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
and they came down and when when she did
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
so this was during pre-process
 
04:11:10.750 --> 04:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
processing she asked if they would show
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
their ID and there was no problem with
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
that process that I saw I saw that they
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to be asked the voters that were
 
04:11:22.269 --> 04:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
there wanted to be asked for their ID
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
they consistently told told us that they
 
04:11:26.670 --> 04:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
were happy to have been asked and they
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
all had IDs and there was not a problem
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
community yes I was asked too and
 
04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
pointed out to them that wasn't required
 
04:11:43.870 --> 04:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:45.870 --> 04:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
me any other questions for
 
04:11:45.880 --> 04:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
me any other questions for
representative

04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
o' in the committee room or
 
04:11:54.750 --> 04:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
hand okay I um I'm looking at the list
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
of attendees I don't see anyone with a
 
04:12:05.550 --> 04:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
hand up is there anyone I have not
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:12:18.349 --> 04:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm David
 
04:12:20.950 --> 04:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
scanland deputy secretary of state and I
 
04:12:23.070 --> 04:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
just like to transfer a little
 
04:12:26.229 --> 04:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
perspective on the last two bills that
 
04:12:29.870 --> 04:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
that just heard um you know I think
 
04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
everybody that sits on this committee
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
understands how polarized uh the
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
political parties have become and that
 
04:12:39.229 --> 04:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
is certainly reflected now uh in our
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
elections and and legislation that's
 
04:12:44.830 --> 04:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
being proposed and you know we cannot
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
show that there is widespread voter
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
fraud uh taking place in New Hampshire
 
04:12:52.269 --> 04:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
and we cannot show that there is
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
widespread voter suppression taking
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
place here either but on either end of
 
04:12:58.830 --> 04:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
that Spectrum there are significant
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of our citizens in the state
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
that believe that to be the case one
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
hand you have people that believe that
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely voter fraud going on
 
04:13:10.510 --> 04:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
and on the other side of that coin you
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
have people that believe that that
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's voter suppression that is being
 
04:13:16.510 --> 04:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
attempted and taking
 
04:13:19.269 --> 04:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
place anything that we can do to help
 
04:13:23.389 --> 04:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
instill confidence in both directions uh
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh in elections is only going to help us
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh maintain the confidence uh that
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
people used to have and you know I have
 
04:13:33.990 --> 04:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
to admit it's you know that confidence
 
04:13:36.830 --> 04:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
is starting to uh to waver a little bit
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh with events that uh have transpired
 
04:13:42.990 --> 04:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
so um the example that I will use is
 
04:13:47.590 --> 04:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
that back in 2012 we passed a a voter ID
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
law where uh you know voters going in
 
04:13:53.429 --> 04:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
are required to show an acceptable form
 
04:13:55.950 --> 04:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
of ID if they don't have it there is an
 
04:13:58.670 --> 04:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
alternative way that uh they can easily
 
04:14:02.189 --> 04:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
still obtain their ballot and cast their
 
04:14:06.590 --> 04:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
vote um I think the same thing uh should
 
04:14:08.429 --> 04:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
take place the absentee balloting
 
04:14:11.070 --> 04:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
process and if we require voters on the
 
04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
day of the election to show an ID it's
 
04:14:17.469 --> 04:14:17.479 align:start position:0%
only appropriate that uh voters um at
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
least voluntarily be offered the
 
04:14:21.910 --> 04:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do just that and I think
 
04:14:25.229 --> 04:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
by doing so we will help instill that
 
04:14:28.070 --> 04:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
confidence uh in voters without creating
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on the process of
 
04:14:32.309 --> 04:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
allowing them to be able to exercise
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
their right to vote so with that Mr
 
04:14:36.389 --> 04:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:14:36.399 --> 04:14:40.070 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be happy to answer any
questions

04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Deputy scan and is there
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr SC scanland
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative waye do you have a
 
04:14:52.469 --> 04:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
question yes I do um I wouldn't normally
 
04:14:56.950 --> 04:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
do this but why we instill confidence by
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
stating that the claims of fraud are not
 
04:15:03.149 --> 04:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
based on evidence rather than succumbing
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
to the perpetuation of
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
Lies uh representative Lane uh there is
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
evidence that there are isolated
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
instances of inappropriate voting uh in
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I don't think
 
04:15:20.229 --> 04:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
we can deny we also have a large segment
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
of our
 
04:15:23.469 --> 04:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
population that for whatever reason
 
04:15:26.590 --> 04:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
believes that it is happening and we
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
cannot ignore the perception because
 
04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
that leads to the the confidence that
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
voters have we have to be willing to
 
04:15:35.309 --> 04:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
address that and to the extent that we
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
are able to do that and not impinge on
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
their right to vote I guess to the other
 
04:15:41.590 --> 04:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
side of the coin that you know there's
 
04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
people that believe that you know a lot
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
of these bills are being offered to uh
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know to push forward voter
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
suppression and we haven't seen that in
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
a widespread way either um does it
 
04:15:57.269 --> 04:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
happen on a small scale uh perhaps but
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
there are people that believe that and
 
04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with that perception and
 
04:16:04.830 --> 04:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
if we can do that and we can we can put
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place that allow voters to
 
04:16:11.790 --> 04:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh believe that the process is uh easy
 
04:16:15.070 --> 04:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
for them to vote but it is also allowing
 
04:16:17.830 --> 04:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
those people who are qualified to vote
 
04:16:20.349 --> 04:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
exercise those rights uh that's to
 
04:16:20.359 --> 04:16:21.990 align:start position:0%
exercise those rights uh that's to
everybody's

04:16:21.990 --> 04:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
04:16:25.030 --> 04:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
benefit representative bar I'm sorry
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
could I have a followup follow up
 
04:16:31.389 --> 04:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
sorry do you think that these Provisions
 
04:16:33.630 --> 04:16:33.640 align:start position:0%
are going to eliminate fraud I mean is
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
there a way to eliminate
 
04:16:35.880 --> 04:16:37.950 align:start position:0%
there a way to eliminate
fraud

04:16:37.950 --> 04:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh I never said that these Provisions
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
would eliminate fraud I think that what
 
04:16:47.790 --> 04:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
these what these uh Provisions do is uh
 
04:16:51.790 --> 04:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
allow an opportunity for a voter to uh
 
04:16:53.670 --> 04:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
easily show that they are who they say
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
they are and that the this gives the
 
04:16:59.469 --> 04:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
clerk the opportunity to to pre verify
 
04:17:01.349 --> 04:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot which helps on the
 
04:17:04.109 --> 04:17:04.119 align:start position:0%
day of the election and by doing that
 
04:17:06.030 --> 04:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
you know we we take a step down the road
 
04:17:11.469 --> 04:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
process you set representative
 
04:17:17.790 --> 04:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
Lane I'm done for
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
today yeah because there was I
 
04:17:24.790 --> 04:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative bar uh yes Deputy Stan
 
04:17:27.229 --> 04:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today um
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
you and I have had a lot of discussions
 
04:17:33.710 --> 04:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
about this issue um around the about V
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
of fraud perception of fraud the
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
definition of fraud is um not going to
 
04:17:42.349 --> 04:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
try to read that today um but I do have
 
04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
a question along um what represented
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
Lane was referring to um the state does
 
04:17:49.710 --> 04:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
have a compelling interest not to
 
04:17:52.229 --> 04:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
suppress the vote and has a compelling
 
04:17:54.670 --> 04:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
interest can vote but I do have a
 
04:17:58.710 --> 04:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
question which is do you believe that by
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
having as loose voter laws as we do
 
04:18:05.149 --> 04:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
particularly around the lack of actual
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
ID that is required you believe that
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
there is some voter suppression by vote
 
04:18:12.670 --> 04:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
by people who would otherwise vote but
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
are now disenfranchised because they
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe in the process
 
04:18:20.109 --> 04:18:20.119 align:start position:0%
anymore I'm sorry representative Barry I
 
04:18:22.269 --> 04:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
I did my best to try and understand the
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
question but I had a difficult time
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
hearing you so um it could be because
 
04:18:30.109 --> 04:18:30.119 align:start position:0%
your mask is on and it's muffled um uh
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
but if you could or somebody could
 
04:18:33.070 --> 04:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
repeat the question that would be
 
04:18:36.990 --> 04:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
helpful my my question secretary scandin
 
04:18:39.389 --> 04:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
is do you think that there are people
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
that do not vote because they do not
 
04:18:44.109 --> 04:18:44.119 align:start position:0%
have faith in our
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
elections uh there may be some uh
 
04:18:50.149 --> 04:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
representa Barry however you know our
 
04:18:52.510 --> 04:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
record speaks for itself you know the
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
percentage of turnout that we have in
 
04:18:58.469 --> 04:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
our elections is consistently uh in the
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
top tier in the country and top tier is
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
top three and so you know New Hampshire
 
04:19:07.229 --> 04:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
despite you know the the sentiment out
 
04:19:09.550 --> 04:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
there is is one of the easiest places to
 
04:19:12.269 --> 04:19:12.279 align:start position:0%
vote uh in the United States and we bear
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
that out uh election after election and
 
04:19:18.750 --> 04:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh but we do have these underpinings we
 
04:19:22.269 --> 04:19:22.279 align:start position:0%
we have these undercurrents of of uh you
 
04:19:25.229 --> 04:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
know beliefs out there that that maybe
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
more perception than they are reality
 
04:19:29.229 --> 04:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
and and I'm just saying that we have to
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
be aware of that and and uh and take
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
steps to address it before it becomes a
 
04:19:36.239 --> 04:19:38.309 align:start position:0%
steps to address it before it becomes a
bigger

04:19:38.309 --> 04:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
bigger
 
04:19:40.510 --> 04:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ter thank you
 
04:19:42.429 --> 04:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you Deputy scan for
 
04:19:43.990 --> 04:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
taking the
 
04:19:44.000 --> 04:19:45.510 align:start position:0%
taking the
question

04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
so in
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
addition this bill giving increased
 
04:19:50.279 --> 04:19:51.229 align:start position:0%
addition this bill giving increased
voter

04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
voter
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
confidence uh in the process would it
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
not also be a good idea to align or
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
bring consistency consistency between
 
04:20:02.189 --> 04:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
in-person voting and AP balloting by
 
04:20:05.149 --> 04:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
that I mean um this would bring the same
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
requirement to show an ID that is
 
04:20:09.149 --> 04:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
required in person would that be good to
 
04:20:10.830 --> 04:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
have that
 
04:20:14.070 --> 04:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
consistency yes I I think to the extent
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
that the voting
 
04:20:19.630 --> 04:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
experience is uh similar to what all
 
04:20:23.389 --> 04:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
other voters experience is uh you know
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
is a goal that we should strive for but
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know with that said I think we do
 
04:20:30.550 --> 04:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
have to recognize that you know the
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
process of people voting by absentee
 
04:20:34.590 --> 04:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
because they cannot make it to the poing
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
place is going to be different
 
04:20:35.920 --> 04:20:37.269 align:start position:0%
place is going to be different
inherently

04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
inherently
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh than showing up at the polls and
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
voting but but to the extent that we can
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
have uniform uh standards uh in the
 
04:20:46.670 --> 04:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
process of voting that's a positive
 
04:20:49.590 --> 04:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
thing thank you other questions for
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
Deputy scanland representative
 
04:20:56.910 --> 04:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
Mir thank you madam chair um my my
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
understanding of your testimony is that
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office supports
 
04:21:02.670 --> 04:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation because it will
 
04:21:05.950 --> 04:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
increase confidence in the fairness and
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
integrity of
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
elections um and I wonder um H is there
 
04:21:15.109 --> 04:21:15.119 align:start position:0%
evidence that the passage of voter ID
 
04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
laws in recent sessions has in fact had
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
the effect of increasing confidence in
 
04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.830 --> 04:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
Elections uh is there evidence that we
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
can point to you know I I'm not aware of
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
a a report or a white paper that anybody
 
04:21:34.990 --> 04:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
has written uh to that effect however um
 
04:21:38.109 --> 04:21:38.119 align:start position:0%
when the voter ID law was being debated
 
04:21:40.510 --> 04:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
it was very controversial it was very
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
similar to what this conversation that
 
04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're having today and there were claims
 
04:21:46.670 --> 04:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
that there were going to be 10% of the
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
population that did not have a voter ID
 
04:21:52.149 --> 04:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
and the reality is within two years
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
after people got used to it it is an
 
04:21:58.109 --> 04:21:58.119 align:start position:0%
nonissue and it it's it is a fraction of
 
04:22:00.109 --> 04:22:00.119 align:start position:0%
1% of the people that show up at the
 
04:22:02.670 --> 04:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
polls now and do not present some form
 
04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
of acceptable ID that was a success
 
04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
story it it it buil confidence I mean
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
there were people prior to that bill
 
04:22:11.429 --> 04:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
passing saying I cannot believe that you
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
know that I don't have to show an ID to
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
go to the you know to to get my ballot
 
04:22:19.229 --> 04:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
um that instilled confidence and and it
 
04:22:22.109 --> 04:22:22.119 align:start position:0%
is a non-issue after the fact and and
 
04:22:24.189 --> 04:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that if we can
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
provide opportunities like this for
 
04:22:30.389 --> 04:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
people in this case to voluntarily offer
 
04:22:35.070 --> 04:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
credentials uh and not uh in not make it
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
more difficult for them to actually vote
 
04:22:42.189 --> 04:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
confidence representative
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
B yes thank you madam chairman uh Deputy
 
04:22:50.670 --> 04:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
scanland my question pertains to the
 
04:22:53.790 --> 04:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
language of the bill House Bill
 
04:22:57.429 --> 04:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
327 um the bill proposes to amend
 
04:23:01.590 --> 04:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
section two of RSA 6571
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
17A section one says that the voter can
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
prove identity by one providing photo
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
identification or two completing a
 
04:23:15.030 --> 04:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
challenge voter affid
 
04:23:19.149 --> 04:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
davit this amendment uses the word and
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the person the envelope is going to
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
be mark saying the person appeared in
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
person and showed an ID and is voter
 
04:23:29.950 --> 04:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
verify should that be or uh so that it's
 
04:23:33.070 --> 04:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
clear that the person chose to proof
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
prove identity either by showing an ID
 
04:23:38.429 --> 04:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
or by filling out the challenged voter
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
affidavit yes yeah I I would agree with
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
that and I and I think if you know that
 
04:23:45.389 --> 04:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
language actually referred back to
 
04:23:47.229 --> 04:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
section one and just said you know
 
04:23:51.030 --> 04:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
either a or b um you know it would
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
effectively do the same thing but I I
 
04:23:54.670 --> 04:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
agree with you and Madame chairman
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question representative bers
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
um also the question I posed to the
 
04:24:02.550 --> 04:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor about marking this information
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
on the absentee ballot affidavit
 
04:24:07.030 --> 04:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
envelope do you know how that's handled
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
now if the clerks aren't supposed to be
 
04:24:11.189 --> 04:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
opening the outer envelope
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
anyway uh I I think you raised a really
 
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
valid point um I mean at that point the
 
04:24:19.229 --> 04:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
only the only envelope that should be
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
accessible to the clerk is the you know
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
the outer
 
04:24:22.920 --> 04:24:26.189 align:start position:0%
the outer
although

04:24:26.189 --> 04:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:28.830 --> 04:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm only hesitating because if they
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
are if they are at that point doing it
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
in person uh at the clerk's office I
 
04:24:36.269 --> 04:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
mean there may be an opportunity to to
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
write it on the affidavit envelope but I
 
04:24:40.349 --> 04:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
think that's an area that they could use
 
04:24:41.790 --> 04:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
a little further
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.070 --> 04:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
questions question from committee
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%

absentee ballots and where those
 
04:30:52.790 --> 04:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots were sent um when I
 
04:30:56.590 --> 04:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
last served on house election law um I
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
was reviewing um this section of the of
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
the rsas and I was surprised to see that
 
04:31:07.469 --> 04:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
um that the information of where
 
04:31:12.030 --> 04:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are mailed um is is
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
done behind the veil of
 
04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
secrecy um in fact if you look on on the
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
bill um line
 
04:31:23.229 --> 04:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
18 um actually it starts on line
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
17 the the true language of the law says
 
04:31:31.590 --> 04:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh the list which is U referring to the
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
list of where um ballots are mailed by
 
04:31:40.149 --> 04:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
the clerks shall be available for public
 
04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh inspection um with a court order so
 
04:31:48.070 --> 04:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
someone in in order to determine where
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
um an absentee ballot has been mailed
 
04:31:53.109 --> 04:31:53.119 align:start position:0%
has to go and get a court order and that
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
includes the Secretary of State um which
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to see that Deputy stanland is
 
04:32:00.830 --> 04:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh is available and hopefully he
 
04:32:05.710 --> 04:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
testifies behind me um he and I uh back
 
04:32:05.720 --> 04:32:07.229 align:start position:0%
testifies behind me um he and I uh back
in

04:32:07.229 --> 04:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:32:11.229 --> 04:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
2019 um requested the uh the Hava
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
Personnel um to do a report and um and
 
04:32:19.469 --> 04:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
they did and they went uh and sat us
 
04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
down in at Fruit Street in conquer
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
although it's not called Fruit Street
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
anymore I forget what it is called um
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
and they will um and they went through
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
the results of uh where absentee ballots
 
04:32:34.950 --> 04:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
were mailed U to addresses outside New
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that was the the specific
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
request I had made where were these
 
04:32:43.790 --> 04:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
ballots being mailed and and so it
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
turned out U that
 
04:32:52.189 --> 04:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
14,46 absentee ballots in the 2016
 
04:32:55.030 --> 04:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
presidential election were mailed to
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
addresses outside New Hampshire that
 
04:33:00.790 --> 04:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
does not include any that were military
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
U aava diplomatic any of that um so this
 
04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
these are just strict
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
14,46 ballots that were mailed to
 
04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
outside addresses and we had asked um
 
04:33:15.709 --> 04:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
for an analysis whether there are any
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
common addresses um where these ballots
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
were sent where multiple ballots went to
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:33:26.750 --> 04:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
address Well turns out they are um and
 
04:33:32.830 --> 04:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
so we received back um in this
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
report I just wanted to Quick T face Mr
 
04:33:39.910 --> 04:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
o'briant thank you go ahead um we found
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
that roughly uh 1,400 or 10% of those
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
ballots um were sent to Common
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
addresses um multiple times so um for
 
04:33:56.029 --> 04:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
instance 100 times New Hampshire town
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
clerks mailed at least three ballots to
 
04:34:02.349 --> 04:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
the to a same physical address um and
 
04:34:04.029 --> 04:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
I'll just scan through this list and
 
04:34:05.789 --> 04:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
give you examples
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
um 68 times four ballots were sent to
 
04:34:11.670 --> 04:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
the same physical address 12 times six
 
04:34:13.629 --> 04:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
ballots were sent to the same physical
 
04:34:17.070 --> 04:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
address outside New Hampshire 13 times
 
04:34:19.349 --> 04:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
eight ballots were sent to the same
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
address nine times 10 ballots were sent
 
04:34:24.910 --> 04:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
to the same physical address outside New
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire four times 14 ballots were
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
sent and I'm skipping I go along here uh
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
three times 19 ballots were sent to the
 
04:34:37.551 --> 04:34:37.561 align:start position:0%
same physical address add two times 21
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
ballots were sent to the same physical
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
address and once the winner is 23
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
ballots went to the same outside New
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire address and we don't know
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
where that address is and we would only
 
04:34:55.629 --> 04:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
know if we had a court order um allowing
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
that information to be known so this
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill does one thing it strikes that word
 
04:35:08.310 --> 04:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
not and it uh allows 60 days after the
 
04:35:10.510 --> 04:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
election that information to be
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
available to the public I wouldn't care
 
04:35:17.590 --> 04:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
if it's 60 days 90 days or 365 days it
 
04:35:20.830 --> 04:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter to me the point is for me
 
04:35:23.230 --> 04:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
that that information should be at some
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
point available for um anyone but mostly
 
04:35:30.910 --> 04:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
in this bill the Secretary of State who
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
should be able to um look at that
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
information and um determine at that
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
point whether anything needs further
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
investigation um I testified in the
 
04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
prior uh bill that um it would be very
 
04:35:50.949 --> 04:35:50.959 align:start position:0%
easy for someone to gain um a list of
 
04:35:53.709 --> 04:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
names uh and request absentee ballots
 
04:35:56.510 --> 04:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
for those those names and be virtually
 
04:35:58.470 --> 04:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
assured of never being
 
04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
caught I'm not saying in any way shape
 
04:36:05.789 --> 04:36:05.799 align:start position:0%
or form that these B
 
04:36:08.349 --> 04:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
that went to the same physical address
 
04:36:11.869 --> 04:36:11.879 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the United States are by any
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
chance proof of fraud I am suggesting
 
04:36:18.029 --> 04:36:18.039 align:start position:0%
that it is proof of Investigation there
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
should be somebody looking at where
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
these went um you know we would have and
 
04:36:26.789 --> 04:36:26.799 align:start position:0%
and some of the examples that I received
 
04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
back from the Hava people were that um
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's entirely possible that
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
some of these may have gone to
 
04:36:35.709 --> 04:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
retirement communities or College
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
or any a couple of other examples that
 
04:36:40.750 --> 04:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
they had anywhere in the United States
 
04:36:43.510 --> 04:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
and it would explain why that they why
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
there would be similar ballots or
 
04:36:47.629 --> 04:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
similar addresses with ballots going to
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
that same address all true all true it
 
04:36:54.789 --> 04:36:54.799 align:start position:0%
is possible that that's true but let's
 
04:36:59.230 --> 04:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
say it is a college and and um and yet
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
after the investigation we find out that
 
04:37:04.269 --> 04:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
23 ballots went to one dorm room in that
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
College should be um give us pause at
 
04:37:11.949 --> 04:37:11.959 align:start position:0%
any rate um so just saying oh well this
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
is a college and that's the explanation
 
04:37:17.670 --> 04:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
for it doesn't work for me um so I'm
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
asking in this bill that the secretary
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
of state would be able to have access to
 
04:37:24.910 --> 04:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
this information and provide a report
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
that would show those four items and for
 
04:37:29.910 --> 04:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
me I won't go through all of them but D
 
04:37:32.590 --> 04:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
is the one that that um is the most
 
04:37:34.590 --> 04:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
important to me and that says for the
 
04:37:37.709 --> 04:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
most common addresses as determined by
 
04:37:39.310 --> 04:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
the number of ballots sent to that
 
04:37:41.629 --> 04:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
address the actual addresses where the
 
04:37:45.551 --> 04:37:45.561 align:start position:0%
ballots were mailed needs to be known um
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's that to me is um is the the money
 
04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
shot in this that's the reason we're
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
doing that um so I with that I will be
 
04:38:00.750 --> 04:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions about um
 
04:38:06.029 --> 04:38:06.039 align:start position:0%
about the research we did or the bill um
 
04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hill questions
 
04:38:12.189 --> 04:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative I do think
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
representative hand up first go
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
ahead so my question then is are you
 
04:38:21.799 --> 04:38:23.109 align:start position:0%
ahead so my question then is are you
talking

04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
talking
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
about out ofate addresses and I have
 
04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
a I I thank you um representative um the
 
04:38:35.551 --> 04:38:35.561 align:start position:0%
the test the examples that I use were
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
specifically to um addresses outside New
 
04:38:41.709 --> 04:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I do know that Deputy scanland
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
asked for a followup to investigate
 
04:38:47.390 --> 04:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
whether any multiple ballots were sent
 
04:38:50.230 --> 04:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
inside New Hampshire I never have seen
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
the the results of that request um and I
 
04:38:56.629 --> 04:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
do know the the examples I was showing
 
04:39:00.830 --> 04:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
were for the 2016 election I do know um
 
04:39:02.789 --> 04:39:02.799 align:start position:0%
in conversations with Deputy scanland
 
04:39:04.510 --> 04:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
that he's asked for the information from
 
04:39:08.349 --> 04:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
this prior presidential election as well
 
04:39:10.670 --> 04:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
but yes I was only talking about outside
 
04:39:13.629 --> 04:39:13.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that CeX were going thank
 
04:39:16.470 --> 04:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
you representative to back to you thank
 
04:39:19.590 --> 04:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
you chair um I was gonna ask a similar
 
04:39:21.869 --> 04:39:21.879 align:start position:0%
question my question
 
04:39:21.879 --> 04:39:23.390 align:start position:0%
question my question
was

04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:39:25.990 --> 04:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
currently current statute can you
 
04:39:27.510 --> 04:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
request information
 
04:39:30.429 --> 04:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
for sent to inside
 
04:39:35.070 --> 04:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
addresses um again this is the current
 
04:39:37.708 --> 04:39:37.718 align:start position:0%
law does not allow it without um a court
 
04:39:41.110 --> 04:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
order so for any whether it's inside
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
outside okay that's what I wanted up and
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
down any of those things
 
04:39:47.670 --> 04:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your
 
04:39:51.510 --> 04:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:55.310 --> 04:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
Lane yes thank you madam chair um the
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
question that I directed to you
 
04:39:56.798 --> 04:39:58.070 align:start position:0%
question that I directed to you
representative

04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
hill before would you like to answer
 
04:40:03.788 --> 04:40:03.798 align:start position:0%
that one now I would be happy to can can
 
04:40:07.350 --> 04:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
you me what the question
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
was I'm 60 you know these things oh well
 
04:40:12.868 --> 04:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
I'm older so you
 
04:40:16.110 --> 04:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
know uh but I think it was more along
 
04:40:18.910 --> 04:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
the lines of what evidence of fraud is
 
04:40:21.550 --> 04:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
there and are we putting forth A
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
solution that is in search of a
 
04:40:26.670 --> 04:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
problem um thank you for your question
 
04:40:28.830 --> 04:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
and uh and I do remember it
 
04:40:34.990 --> 04:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
now but it um I I again I think as I I
 
04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
offer here and as I said this is not
 
04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
proof of fraud um this is this is merely
 
04:40:46.510 --> 04:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
um in an effort to um to um increase
 
04:40:49.070 --> 04:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
transparency um and and shed a little
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
sunlight on some of this um and
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
certainly Deputy I agree with Deputy
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
scanlan's comments about um um adding
 
04:41:01.390 --> 04:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
some measure of um of certain toe to uh
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
to people that are voting um it was
 
04:41:06.830 --> 04:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
possible for me to get this this list of
 
04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
information and I know you can't read it
 
04:41:11.550 --> 04:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
but the list um of where these multiple
 
04:41:14.590 --> 04:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
ballots have gone is is takes up about
 
04:41:18.750 --> 04:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
half the page um I just think that that
 
04:41:21.550 --> 04:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
um is worthy of Investigation but I I
 
04:41:24.750 --> 04:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
said clearly that it is not proof of
 
04:41:27.390 --> 04:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
fraud could I have a followup please
 
04:41:31.110 --> 04:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
sure who who is doing the investigation
 
04:41:34.030 --> 04:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
I I guess maybe I didn't read the bill
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
who is doing that investigation what
 
04:41:37.550 --> 04:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
what do you do with this information
 
04:41:43.470 --> 04:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
when you get it um so in the bill um it
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
requires the Secretary of State to
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:52.750 --> 04:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
report but once that report is that the
 
04:41:54.510 --> 04:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
investigation that you're requesting is
 
04:41:55.788 --> 04:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
simply that
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
information um no that report would then
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
be sent and
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
I um jumped ahead sorry um the uh I'm
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm asking that the uh secretary of
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
state would um would create this report
 
04:42:15.480 --> 04:42:15.490 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to
 
04:42:15.490 --> 04:42:17.430 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to
[Music]

04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
see where it says that the report goes I
 
04:42:23.470 --> 04:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
I would have expected it to go to um the
 
04:42:26.350 --> 04:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
election law chairs um and the Senate
 
04:42:28.430 --> 04:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
President and the speaker of the house
 
04:42:30.750 --> 04:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
but I don't see it listed so I will make
 
04:42:30.760 --> 04:42:33.550 align:start position:0%
but I don't see it listed so I will make
a

04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:36.430 --> 04:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
note thank you for your
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh representative
 
04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
Brian did you still have a followup yes
 
04:42:46.868 --> 04:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
I do thank you ma'am um so my my
 
04:42:50.310 --> 04:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
question representa Phil yes if these
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:58.110 --> 04:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:01.708 --> 04:43:01.718 align:start position:0%
you imagine the problem could be that
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
say it's going to New Hampshire
 
04:43:07.430 --> 04:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
residents who are at Harvard University
 
04:43:11.230 --> 04:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
which is out of state or Yale University
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
out state but in the same building would
 
04:43:16.910 --> 04:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
that be listed as the same address would
 
04:43:20.350 --> 04:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
that be two3 Main Street Cambridge
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and then that's why it
 
04:43:24.910 --> 04:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
looks like the same address um thank you
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
for your
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
question I'm afraid I can't be very
 
04:43:30.868 --> 04:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
specific with the answer um I'm only
 
04:43:34.750 --> 04:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
taking the the information from the hob
 
04:43:37.708 --> 04:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
people who investigated it and and it
 
04:43:40.430 --> 04:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
was their determination what whether
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
that was the same address or not um it
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
it may have just said Harvard I don't
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
know um we we never did see the
 
04:43:51.550 --> 04:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
addresses we were told however that um
 
04:43:54.788 --> 04:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
you know one was an RV park one was a
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
college interestingly one of them was a
 
04:44:01.310 --> 04:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
um was a highr rather expensive
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
high-rise apartment building in Boston
 
04:44:08.590 --> 04:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
um but we don't know the address or why
 
04:44:11.550 --> 04:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
um ballots would be sent to that address
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
so the investigation has never gone
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
beyond just just knowing from the Hava
 
04:44:22.030 --> 04:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
people that it was a common address and
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
and how many ballots went
 
04:44:27.788 --> 04:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
there thank you for the followup
 
04:44:30.150 --> 04:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Madame chairman
 
04:44:30.160 --> 04:44:31.270 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Madame chairman
uh

04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:33.310 --> 04:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
representative I could certainly
 
04:44:35.470 --> 04:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
understand the value of of this type of
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
report uh to the Secretary of State's
 
04:44:39.430 --> 04:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
office and perhaps the Attorney
 
04:44:42.230 --> 04:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
General's office for internal use and
 
04:44:45.310 --> 04:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
and investigation purposes but at what
 
04:44:47.830 --> 04:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
point does publishing people's addresses
 
04:44:49.830 --> 04:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
start to infringe on their right to
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
privacy uh you know our constitution
 
04:44:55.150 --> 04:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
says that an individual is has a right
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
to live free from governmental intrusion
 
04:45:00.590 --> 04:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
and private or personal information um
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
what value is there in taking this
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
information and making it public
 
04:45:07.788 --> 04:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
when its purpose and its use should be
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
driven by the needs of the Secretary of
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
State and the Attorney General's
 
04:45:15.788 --> 04:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
office uh thankks for your question um I
 
04:45:19.150 --> 04:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
will tell you that years ago um before
 
04:45:22.070 --> 04:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
this was um only available by court
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
order um the practice used to be that
 
04:45:28.510 --> 04:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk would um create a list of
 
04:45:31.150 --> 04:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
names of where she had sent absente
 
04:45:33.868 --> 04:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
ballots and posted on the door of the uh
 
04:45:37.230 --> 04:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
of the clerk's office and and and it was
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
only at that point that someone pointed
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
out it was a great tool for burglar to
 
04:45:43.510 --> 04:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
use to know that somebody wasn't going
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
to be at that address and and that would
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
be a great place to go but at that I
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
guess I point that out to say that um
 
04:45:52.200 --> 04:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
guess I point that out to say that um
you

04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:45:56.788 --> 04:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
know it's it's not very difficult to um
 
04:45:58.868 --> 04:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
to have a list of addresses you can do
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
it with if they still publish telephone
 
04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
books I don't know um but uh
 
04:46:08.788 --> 04:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
but having a place where 23 ballots were
 
04:46:12.030 --> 04:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
sent to a single address
 
04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
um you know I I I would have no problem
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
quite frankly if if the bill was amended
 
04:46:20.230 --> 04:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
so that the Secretary of State and the
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General had it that was the
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
reason I I delineated the Secretary of
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
State in here um but I I have always uh
 
04:46:31.830 --> 04:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
deferred to the idea of sunshine being
 
04:46:35.948 --> 04:46:35.958 align:start position:0%
the greatest expected so um I would I
 
04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
would make the information known um
 
04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
publicly okay thank you no further
 
04:46:44.910 --> 04:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
04:46:47.230 --> 04:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
representative Cody H yes thank you
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%

04:46:53.310 --> 04:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
document to which you are referring what
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
what what is the provence of that
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
document from which you're deriving this
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
information is that a document that was
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
the result of a report or I'm a little
 
04:47:05.230 --> 04:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
confused as to what the provence of it
 
04:47:07.868 --> 04:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
was uh thank you representative Cody
 
04:47:12.430 --> 04:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again um it is uh this
 
04:47:14.990 --> 04:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
was a request uh that was made as I was
 
04:47:17.708 --> 04:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
sitting as Vice chair of this committee
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
um by through um deputy scanland and it
 
04:47:26.350 --> 04:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
was um it was created uh by the Hava
 
04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
people on Constitution have I think it
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
is actually now um and uh and so it it
 
04:47:36.070 --> 04:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't a report that went anywhere that
 
04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm aware um unless Deputy scanland um
 
04:47:43.868 --> 04:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
did anything with it that I'm unaware of
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh could you Poss uh sorry madam chair I
 
04:47:50.350 --> 04:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
further question um could you possibly
 
04:47:52.430 --> 04:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of that material to the
 
04:47:52.440 --> 04:47:53.948 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of that material to the
committee

04:47:53.948 --> 04:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely um I mailed yes I emailed
 
04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
yesterday at 4 something in the
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon um to the committee a list of
 
04:48:04.670 --> 04:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
04:48:04.680 --> 04:48:06.190 align:start position:0%
all of the
uh

04:48:06.190 --> 04:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh the number apprciate that I
 
04:48:11.110 --> 04:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate that represented but I'm
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
referring specifically to to the the
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
full document yes here here this is the
 
04:48:20.470 --> 04:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
single document that I have it's one
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
page that um that was created um that
 
04:48:27.788 --> 04:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
shows those numbers on here but it was
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
such small print that that's why I I
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
created my own document with larger font
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
because again I'm 60 so representative
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
Cody is that the piece of paper that you
 
04:48:41.548 --> 04:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
want and we'll ask representative Hill
 
04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
to scan it and send it to us yes I think
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful thank you madam
 
04:48:48.910 --> 04:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
chair excellent I will do that okay
 
04:48:51.310 --> 04:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative representative Phil uh do
 
04:48:58.548 --> 04:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
you foresee that this would in any way
 
04:49:01.830 --> 04:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:05.708 --> 04:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
vote I we it bite by simply Shining
 
04:49:09.070 --> 04:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
Light on the addresses where Bill and
 
04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
ballot went would that have the impact
 
04:49:14.670 --> 04:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
of suppressing vote you believe um or
 
04:49:17.948 --> 04:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
should it um thank you for your question
 
04:49:21.788 --> 04:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
I have no idea why it would I can't
 
04:49:23.788 --> 04:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
sitting here think of a reason why it
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
would um I think
 
04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's just um information of
 
04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
of where multiple ballots are being sent
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
um not not in any way shape or form an
 
04:49:42.750 --> 04:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
vote might it suppressed the vote
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
slightly of 23 ballots shouldn't have
 
04:49:51.788 --> 04:49:51.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
address clarification this is a a report
 
04:49:58.350 --> 04:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
after the election correct correct okay
 
04:50:00.788 --> 04:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
representative Ward do you have a
 
04:50:03.150 --> 04:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you madam chair and
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hill for uh
 
04:50:07.150 --> 04:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question you may have answered
 
04:50:09.230 --> 04:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
this before but I wonder if you could
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
Define with a little more specificity
 
04:50:13.708 --> 04:50:13.718 align:start position:0%
what you mean by Common address same
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
street number same town same zip code um
 
04:50:19.788 --> 04:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
sure if I recall the exact language that
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
Deputy scanland used he may recall um if
 
04:50:34.510 --> 04:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
he testifies after me what what was
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
given to the Hava people in order to
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
generate this um I don't recall them
 
04:50:44.670 --> 04:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
ever getting to the specificity of of
 
04:50:47.270 --> 04:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
what what was detailed but we were
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
talking about um a single address where
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
multiple ballots had gone now you know
 
04:50:56.270 --> 04:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
if you think about a college it is
 
04:50:59.070 --> 04:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
possible that colleges have their own
 
04:51:02.548 --> 04:51:02.558 align:start position:0%
mail room so one address may go to a
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
single uh or one mailing may go to a
 
04:51:08.948 --> 04:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
single mail room and for multiple
 
04:51:13.030 --> 04:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
students um so that that was my
 
04:51:16.270 --> 04:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
indication that um and that's why I say
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
this is not proof of anything um it's
 
04:51:23.110 --> 04:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
just a fodder for further
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
investigation I hope that answers the
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you thank you for
 
04:51:29.070 --> 04:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
the question from members of the
 
04:51:31.628 --> 04:51:31.638 align:start position:0%
committee in room Deputy scanland has
 
04:51:37.350 --> 04:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:38.670 --> 04:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
04:51:40.230 --> 04:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh once again I'm David
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
scanland deputy secretary of state uh
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on this bill but I
 
04:51:46.510 --> 04:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
would like to just get let the committee
 
04:51:48.590 --> 04:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
have a little history and maybe
 
04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
clarification on what we're talking
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
about here um the the Statewide
 
04:51:56.350 --> 04:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
centralized voter database known as
 
04:51:59.390 --> 04:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
election net uh was a requirement of the
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
help America vote act that passed in
 
04:52:05.990 --> 04:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
2002 and it required uh the state it
 
04:52:08.070 --> 04:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
required every state to create such a
 
04:52:09.788 --> 04:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
database if they did not already have
 
04:52:13.548 --> 04:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
one and it required certain items um a
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
lot of personal information related to
 
04:52:18.750 --> 04:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
the voter uh be kept in that
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
database when the legislature the New
 
04:52:23.470 --> 04:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature created the
 
04:52:26.350 --> 04:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
database or authorized it they said very
 
04:52:29.628 --> 04:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
clearly that the that the personal
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
information of the voter was to remain
 
04:52:35.310 --> 04:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
confidential the it was built with the
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
barn doors closed and if any of you know
 
04:52:42.270 --> 04:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh represent Neil Kirk um a really
 
04:52:44.350 --> 04:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
strong privacy Advocate was chair of the
 
04:52:46.430 --> 04:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
finance committee for a number of years
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh saw to it that those protections were
 
04:52:49.120 --> 04:52:50.270 align:start position:0%
uh saw to it that those protections were
in

04:52:50.270 --> 04:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
place um at some subsequent uh bium the
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
legislature did loosen up the uh the
 
04:53:01.990 --> 04:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
database to allow for uh the
 
04:53:04.990 --> 04:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
distribution of public check L uh
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
allowing the Secretary of State to sell
 
04:53:12.788 --> 04:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
a Statewide list to political parties uh
 
04:53:14.310 --> 04:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh political committees registered in
 
04:53:16.430 --> 04:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and to political
 
04:53:18.270 --> 04:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
candidates and for candidates we could
 
04:53:20.590 --> 04:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
produce the list for the candidates
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
District but uh we could not break it
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
down any more than that any member of
 
04:53:27.270 --> 04:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
the public any citizen of New Hampshire
 
04:53:29.910 --> 04:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
that wanted to obtain a list could go to
 
04:53:32.190 --> 04:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
their Town Clerk or supervisors of the
 
04:53:34.830 --> 04:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
checklist and purchase that list
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
directly from uh that person for just
 
04:53:42.390 --> 04:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
that uh uh political
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
subdivision the um the legislature then
 
04:53:46.798 --> 04:53:48.310 align:start position:0%
subdivision the um the legislature then
said

04:53:48.310 --> 04:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:53:51.788 --> 04:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
um uh well so as as part of that the the
 
04:53:54.670 --> 04:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
clerks then during election season
 
04:53:58.350 --> 04:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
received the absentee ballot requests uh
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
and they keep a list of that and they
 
04:54:02.350 --> 04:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
keep track of when the request was
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
received when the ballot got naed out
 
04:54:06.110 --> 04:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes back and whether it was
 
04:54:08.110 --> 04:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
actually counted or not in the
 
04:54:10.350 --> 04:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
election those lists are also
 
04:54:12.270 --> 04:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
confidential that information is put in
 
04:54:14.830 --> 04:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
election net but the information is kept
 
04:54:17.390 --> 04:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
at the clerk's office and the law says
 
04:54:19.948 --> 04:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
that that information is also
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
confidential information except that a
 
04:54:26.510 --> 04:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
candidate who is running for office can
 
04:54:28.470 --> 04:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
obtain that list of Voters so that they
 
04:54:31.708 --> 04:54:31.718 align:start position:0%
can communicate uh with the voter um and
 
04:54:33.150 --> 04:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
send them information but no other
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
member of the public uh is authorized to
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
obtain that list after the election is
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
over and we have elected officials but
 
04:54:44.670 --> 04:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
at that point we have no candidates that
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
list is uh no longer
 
04:54:49.990 --> 04:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
available uh unless there's a court
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
order uh you know to obtain that
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
list what what uh representative Hill
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
requested uh when he was vice chair of
 
04:55:01.628 --> 04:55:01.638 align:start position:0%
the committee was information in
 
04:55:05.788 --> 04:55:05.798 align:start position:0%
aggregate form uh related to uh absentee
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
ballots that were sent to the same
 
04:55:12.190 --> 04:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
address multiple times and the report
 
04:55:15.750 --> 04:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
that we generated uh at for that request
 
04:55:18.430 --> 04:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
was was an aggregate request there was
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
no voter identification I tied to it uh
 
04:55:24.070 --> 04:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't think the addresses were
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
available it was simply numbers saying
 
04:55:30.070 --> 04:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
that there were you know 10 ballots sent
 
04:55:33.548 --> 04:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
to uh you know 21 you know whatever the
 
04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
number was um and and that is the list
 
04:55:39.948 --> 04:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
that representative Hill is referring to
 
04:55:43.548 --> 04:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
and and we will produce uh reports based
 
04:55:46.110 --> 04:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
on aggregate information that are that
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
are aggregate in form based on
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
information in the database um you know
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
if it's helpful to A legislature or
 
04:55:55.070 --> 04:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee to you know understand issues
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
but we do not in any uh instance uh
 
04:56:02.548 --> 04:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
provide private and confidential
 
04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
information about the voters themselves
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
their addresses or you know anything uh
 
04:56:10.948 --> 04:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
anything else that's related so I think
 
04:56:13.390 --> 04:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
it's important that that me may be be
 
04:56:13.400 --> 04:56:14.190 align:start position:0%
it's important that that me may be be
made

04:56:14.190 --> 04:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
made
 
04:56:18.310 --> 04:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
clear I will end by saying that this uh
 
04:56:21.070 --> 04:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
is policy that is in the domain of the
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and uh we will um
 
04:56:30.390 --> 04:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
vigorously uh protect the private and
 
04:56:34.190 --> 04:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
confidential information of the voters
 
04:56:36.110 --> 04:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
that are in that database and if there
 
04:56:38.708 --> 04:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
is legislation that comes forward that
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
says somehow that we should be releasing
 
04:56:43.390 --> 04:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
that information uh we
 
04:56:46.948 --> 04:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
will uh very strongly oppose it however
 
04:56:48.510 --> 04:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you know the
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
committee believes it reports in
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
aggregate form or uh you know if there's
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
an expansion of who is entitled to have
 
04:56:56.708 --> 04:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:56:59.350 --> 04:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
checklist um you know those those are
 
04:57:01.548 --> 04:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
your decisions to make and you know we
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
will uh obviously
 
04:57:05.990 --> 04:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
um abide by whatever the legislature
 
04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
decides in that respect so with that
 
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you does anybody have
 
04:57:15.230 --> 04:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
any questions forut
 
04:57:17.948 --> 04:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
SC thank you madam chair thank you again
 
04:57:20.070 --> 04:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
Deputy scalan I had a question in regard
 
04:57:22.708 --> 04:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
to the voter list that um a candidate
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
can get from the town clerk of where
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:57:29.270 --> 04:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
candidate it's my understanding is
 
04:57:31.230 --> 04:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
you're stated that you get that list for
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
those addresses but if they if the voter
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
has a PO Box you can only get the street
 
04:57:40.030 --> 04:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
address you can't get the PO Box is that
 
04:57:43.750 --> 04:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
accurate is that correct statement uh I
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
I would have to go back and actually
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
look at the statute I think what the
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
clerk um can provide is the name of the
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
voter and uh and either their mailing or
 
04:57:55.470 --> 04:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
physical address those that that's
 
04:57:55.480 --> 04:57:56.470 align:start position:0%
physical address those that that's
public

04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:58:00.150 --> 04:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
information um they will not provide the
 
04:58:02.830 --> 04:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
address where the absentee ballot is
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
being sent to if it is a location other
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
than what is on the uh on the checklist
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of that statute
 
04:58:12.240 --> 04:58:17.990 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of that statute
thank

04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:18.000 --> 04:58:20.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
youline I'm not seeing any thank you
 
04:58:25.628 --> 04:58:25.638 align:start position:0%
Deputy scan thank you I don't have
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else signed up to testify in
 
04:58:31.628 --> 04:58:31.638 align:start position:0%
regards to House Bill 291 is there
 
04:58:34.110 --> 04:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else who would just see to this
 
04:58:36.990 --> 04:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not seeing anybody so I'm going
 
04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
to close the hearing on House Bill 291
 
04:58:42.548 --> 04:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
and open the hearing that was supposed
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
to begin 15 minutes ago too late on
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:58:49.430 --> 04:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
406 this is relative to the ability of
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
the public to observe the processing and
 
04:58:55.990 --> 04:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
Counting of absentee ballots um I don't
 
04:58:58.548 --> 04:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
have anybody signed up to speak to this
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
bill but I understand representative PR
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
home O'Brien can speak to HP
 
04:59:04.320 --> 04:59:06.110 align:start position:0%
home O'Brien can speak to HP
406

04:59:06.110 --> 04:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
406
 
04:59:09.190 --> 04:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
to to the FL and I just asked that you
 
04:59:17.230 --> 04:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:21.430 --> 04:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you um Madame
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and and the
 
04:59:29.430 --> 04:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
committee this bill uh I I passed out
 
04:59:34.230 --> 04:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
some uh diagrams for you all to
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
show the setup of the area where the
 
04:59:43.868 --> 04:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
pre-processing of fent ballots was done
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
this earlier this year in Derry and it
 
04:59:52.628 --> 04:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
may be hard for you to um visualize that
 
04:59:54.628 --> 04:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
so I will take something that's similar
 
04:59:54.638 --> 04:59:55.708 align:start position:0%
so I will take something that's similar
in

04:59:55.708 --> 04:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
size this is about the same size and the
 
05:00:01.548 --> 05:00:01.558 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots were Pro processed and
 
05:00:04.190 --> 05:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
vared all right with a
 
05:00:05.430 --> 05:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind because we're doing
 
05:00:07.070 --> 05:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
this sort of hybrid and I think you were
 
05:00:08.590 --> 05:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
able to pass out things to committee
 
05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
members but members did not the bill as
 
05:00:15.910 --> 05:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
proposed for which you are a sponsor
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
proposes specific language that the
 
05:00:20.070 --> 05:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
members of the public shall be committed
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
to observe the processing and Counting
 
05:00:25.070 --> 05:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
of abente ballots without obstruction
 
05:00:27.270 --> 05:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
and from a distance of six feet from
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
such across the sing County correct
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
correct it's all about being able to see
 
05:00:35.110 --> 05:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
the the um processing of the of the
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and so when you have a a
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
a partition between yourself and you're
 
05:00:42.470 --> 05:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
the if you're the Publican and something
 
05:00:44.750 --> 05:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
between you can't see anything that's
 
05:00:47.788 --> 05:00:47.798 align:start position:0%
happening behind that partition I don't
 
05:00:49.548 --> 05:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
think that there was anything the fair
 
05:00:52.510 --> 05:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
is planned with the setup that we that I
 
05:00:54.830 --> 05:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
saw that I I saw and one of the other
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
sponsors saw for this I think it's just
 
05:00:59.708 --> 05:00:59.718 align:start position:0%
that that was a very convenient place to
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
do the absentee ballot pre-processing
 
05:01:02.638 --> 05:01:03.350 align:start position:0%
do the absentee ballot pre-processing
but

05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:01:07.030 --> 05:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
every RSA that we have uh regarding this
 
05:01:09.390 --> 05:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
is about transparency and about the
 
05:01:10.750 --> 05:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
public being able to see what's
 
05:01:14.788 --> 05:01:14.798 align:start position:0%
happening in real time and for that
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
reason this is uh something that that
 
05:01:20.708 --> 05:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
myself and the other um sponsors thought
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
was important to clarify in state law
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
because it had not been uh so again like
 
05:01:30.390 --> 05:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
there was nothing nefarious that I'm
 
05:01:33.990 --> 05:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
aware of it's just wasen place to to do
 
05:01:37.628 --> 05:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
the pre-processing but it wasn't truly
 
05:01:40.548 --> 05:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
as transparent as I think the spirit of
 
05:01:44.830 --> 05:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
every other law um dictates that we have
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
regarding ballot processing all
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
right I hope that's clear and I hope
 
05:01:52.990 --> 05:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
that the the diagrams that everybody has
 
05:01:54.670 --> 05:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
well but nobody online can see so I'm
 
05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
gonna make an attempt here for committee
 
05:01:59.070 --> 05:01:59.080 align:start position:0%
members who are viewing this online I
 
05:02:03.230 --> 05:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can see if you the
 
05:02:05.948 --> 05:02:05.958 align:start position:0%
Town Council room in Dairy it's my
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
recollection because I watched these
 
05:02:10.110 --> 05:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
meetings almost looks like a courtroom
 
05:02:12.548 --> 05:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
you walk into it and there's actually
 
05:02:15.150 --> 05:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
two bays of seating as you enter the
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
room and then at the front of the room
 
05:02:23.070 --> 05:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
there's a half circle of a table that if
 
05:02:24.990 --> 05:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
it was straight would look across like a
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
Judicial bench where Town Council
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
Members sit behind it to conduct
 
05:02:32.310 --> 05:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
business while the camera is looking at
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
them and in front of and that this
 
05:02:38.590 --> 05:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
platform sits on about 8 Ines according
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
to the diagram and so you're aware
 
05:02:42.910 --> 05:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
because I actually did think it was a
 
05:02:44.270 --> 05:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
courtroom the first time I took a look
 
05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
at it real quick at the front of the
 
05:02:52.430 --> 05:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
bench with the members sitting behind it
 
05:02:53.948 --> 05:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:02:57.910 --> 05:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
elevated um with a piece of wood I think
 
05:03:00.230 --> 05:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's actually I don't know six to 10
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
inches that goes all the way around so
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
it would be a there was a ledge right
 
05:03:08.190 --> 05:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
here in front of us so you would not be
 
05:03:10.990 --> 05:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
able to see my scribbling on the paper
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
we turning the page that's an excellent
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
description representative okay yeah so
 
05:03:19.390 --> 05:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
so this is what representative O'Brien
 
05:03:21.750 --> 05:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
she she passed out this diagram in
 
05:03:24.868 --> 05:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
regards to how the Town Council room is
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
set up and that's where apparently they
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
did the processing correct yes all right
 
05:03:31.990 --> 05:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's it's a convenient place to
 
05:03:33.990 --> 05:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
do the processing I I can understand why
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
they were chosen
 
05:03:38.948 --> 05:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't see anything okay but
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
I could we could not see where what was
 
05:03:43.390 --> 05:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
happening with B all right thank you any
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:52.470 --> 05:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
attending oh sorry I missed it
 
05:03:57.030 --> 05:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lane oh sorry it's in
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
real I'm looking for my little I'm sorry
 
05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
I wasn't fast enough so thank you um
 
05:04:07.350 --> 05:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
in my ward where we usually vote um I'm
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
not sure that it can be configured to do
 
05:04:12.910 --> 05:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
that within six feet and have it's such
 
05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
a tiny spot so I guess I just raised
 
05:04:19.230 --> 05:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
that from my own personal experience is
 
05:04:22.990 --> 05:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
there some wiggle room um I mean they'd
 
05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
have to be really close or they have to
 
05:04:27.230 --> 05:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
stand really far away I and I guess I I
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if ours is unusual or what
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
but it it is very difficult for them to
 
05:04:36.430 --> 05:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:39.708 --> 05:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
is so thank you is that was that a
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
question uh is it is it I guess is it
 
05:04:45.030 --> 05:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
possible to do
 
05:04:47.070 --> 05:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
something I don't know if they can do
 
05:04:50.030 --> 05:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
six feet because I mean it it would have
 
05:04:51.390 --> 05:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
to probably
 
05:04:55.868 --> 05:04:55.878 align:start position:0%
be longer than that wider way than that
 
05:04:58.070 --> 05:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
just because of the physical constraints
 
05:04:59.788 --> 05:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
of of everything else that they've got
 
05:04:59.798 --> 05:05:01.470 align:start position:0%
of of everything else that they've got
going

05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
on well thank you representative Lane
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:05:08.990 --> 05:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
um every Situation's a little different
 
05:05:10.910 --> 05:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
in our state I think we're all familiar
 
05:05:14.510 --> 05:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
with that that that every U town hall or
 
05:05:17.310 --> 05:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
or Municipal Center or school is
 
05:05:20.190 --> 05:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
different than the other ones but we do
 
05:05:24.390 --> 05:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
try to have some unification in law so
 
05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
that all of our citizens will um have
 
05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
the same expectations and the same
 
05:05:33.948 --> 05:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
treatment when they try to observe the
 
05:05:37.070 --> 05:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
um the counting of and the processing of
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
of ballots and of the absentee ballots I
 
05:05:43.110 --> 05:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that this it's too much to
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
ask to not have a lip on the desk like a
 
05:05:49.230 --> 05:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
a reception desk we're all maybe
 
05:05:50.830 --> 05:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with the governor's reception
 
05:05:55.350 --> 05:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
desk it's like that and I like to call
 
05:05:57.628 --> 05:05:57.638 align:start position:0%
this in in simple terms I call this the
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
hands where I can see them bill because
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
we should be able to see what's going on
 
05:06:04.548 --> 05:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:06:04.558 --> 05:06:07.030 align:start position:0%
with the
ballots

05:06:07.030 --> 05:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
05:06:09.788 --> 05:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
so me for interrupting I guess in
 
05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
followup to attorney Lane's question it
 
05:06:14.590 --> 05:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like the six feet was the
 
05:06:17.150 --> 05:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
issue the issue was you couldn't see the
 
05:06:19.470 --> 05:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
hands right it could be one foot it
 
05:06:20.910 --> 05:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
would still be a problem could be eight
 
05:06:23.910 --> 05:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
feet right the six feet is
 
05:06:27.070 --> 05:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
not the distance was not the issue it
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't as if you were me showing up
 
05:06:30.628 --> 05:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
without your glasses at 6 Fe and
 
05:06:32.070 --> 05:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't see what they were doing the
 
05:06:35.310 --> 05:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
issue was you couldn't see the hands
 
05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
right you couldn't you couldn't watch
 
05:06:39.868 --> 05:06:39.878 align:start position:0%
meaningfully the actual process there
 
05:06:43.150 --> 05:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
are Provisions where six feet is is is
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh indicated because that's far enough
 
05:06:47.430 --> 05:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
away for you to see what's happening
 
05:06:49.390 --> 05:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
with the ballot but you're not so close
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing that your neighbor
 
05:06:53.910 --> 05:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
Mrs Smith voted a certain way you're not
 
05:06:55.470 --> 05:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
seeing the ballots that close all right
 
05:06:57.548 --> 05:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
but I guess the question is
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bri
 
05:07:04.990 --> 05:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
is if the six speak was if the distance
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
minimum was eliminated from this bill
 
05:07:09.390 --> 05:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
given that there are other Provisions in
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
Statute in regards to the ability to
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
observe does that make the bill
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
meaningless to you or is the main
 
05:07:20.430 --> 05:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
provision that you can actually see the
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
processing without
 
05:07:24.590 --> 05:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
obstruction that is the main point the
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
the not having obstruction okay thank
 
05:07:30.510 --> 05:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
you all right other questions I have a
 
05:07:33.310 --> 05:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
couple other hands but I don't see any
 
05:07:33.320 --> 05:07:35.070 align:start position:0%
couple other hands but I don't see any
other

05:07:35.070 --> 05:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:07:35.080 --> 05:07:39.230 align:start position:0%
other
questions

05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:43.310 --> 05:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
um Deputy scanland you have your hand
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
up thank you madam chair once again
 
05:07:46.990 --> 05:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm David
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
scanland deputy secretary of state um
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor in this bill uh
 
05:07:56.070 --> 05:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
explained the situation that you just uh
 
05:07:59.070 --> 05:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
showed visually in that chart and uh it
 
05:08:01.310 --> 05:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
it did not seem right um you there
 
05:08:04.030 --> 05:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
should be transparency in this process
 
05:08:06.830 --> 05:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
and uh we would certainly support that
 
05:08:09.628 --> 05:08:09.638 align:start position:0%
um I think the six foot figure may have
 
05:08:11.190 --> 05:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
come in there because there is a
 
05:08:13.510 --> 05:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
requirement uh at the voter registration
 
05:08:16.190 --> 05:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
table that uh that observers cannot get
 
05:08:19.548 --> 05:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
any closer than six feet to that process
 
05:08:22.030 --> 05:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
but I did want to comment on the way
 
05:08:24.910 --> 05:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
this uh this amendment is written uh
 
05:08:26.670 --> 05:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
because it says members of the public
 
05:08:28.190 --> 05:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
shall be permitted to observe the
 
05:08:29.868 --> 05:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
processing and Counting of absentee
 
05:08:33.030 --> 05:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
ballots without obstruction and from a
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
distance of six feet from such
 
05:08:37.350 --> 05:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
processing and counting to me that means
 
05:08:39.150 --> 05:08:39.160 align:start position:0%
that every member that wants to observe
 
05:08:41.628 --> 05:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
that process should be able to be six
 
05:08:45.430 --> 05:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
feet away and uh as representative Lane
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that may not be practical in
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
probably most polling places so um you
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
know I I think what is uh you know
 
05:08:55.708 --> 05:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
what's important here is that that
 
05:08:58.270 --> 05:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
process be transparent and that the
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
people that want to observe it can can
 
05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
do so in a meaningful way and with that
 
05:09:06.868 --> 05:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:09.230 --> 05:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
questions3 well I guess I I have a
 
05:09:12.990 --> 05:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
question so Deputy scalin so is when you
 
05:09:16.270 --> 05:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
say members of the public are
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
you insinuating that there should be a a
 
05:09:21.750 --> 05:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
distinction between members of the
 
05:09:26.948 --> 05:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
observers no what I'm saying is I I
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that it may not be practical
 
05:09:34.350 --> 05:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
or possible for each member of the
 
05:09:37.190 --> 05:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
public to be exactly six feet away
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
from the uh you know the the processing
 
05:09:42.548 --> 05:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
of the absentee ballots which is what
 
05:09:45.390 --> 05:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
that sentence seems to imply all right
 
05:09:47.948 --> 05:09:47.958 align:start position:0%
your issue was not with the members of
 
05:09:49.990 --> 05:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
the public piece of the SE section it
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
was with the six feet that's right okay
 
05:09:55.788 --> 05:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
sorry I misinterpreted what you said
 
05:09:57.510 --> 05:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee members
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
in attendance here or attending
 
05:10:01.040 --> 05:10:04.510 align:start position:0%
in attendance here or attending
online

05:10:04.510 --> 05:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:08.150 --> 05:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any um I don't have

thank you madam chair and
 
05:12:04.110 --> 05:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
and the uh the committee for for putting
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
up with my technology problems here and
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for to kathern prudom Brian
 
05:12:11.110 --> 05:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh for for doing a good job uh
 
05:12:13.110 --> 05:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
presenting this uh when representative
 
05:12:15.390 --> 05:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
Lane was talking about uh you know the
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
the area at htown U you know the the
 
05:12:21.628 --> 05:12:21.638 align:start position:0%
ward being too small and uh how can how
 
05:12:23.548 --> 05:12:23.558 align:start position:0%
can you know on on one hand you're
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
talking about it's too small to have six
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
feet but you want it bigger if it's too
 
05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
small it should be shrunk to four maybe
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
um you know um that that that doesn't
 
05:12:34.948 --> 05:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
make much sense to me but uh you know
 
05:12:37.830 --> 05:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
anyway um you know what happened here uh
 
05:12:40.548 --> 05:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
is uh you know when I when I walked in I
 
05:12:42.030 --> 05:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
you know I noticed that nobody could see
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
anything and uh you know I think six
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
feet is a a a a real good distance for
 
05:12:50.670 --> 05:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh you can see what's going on uh you
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
know it it just lends the transparency
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know in this this day and age of
 
05:12:57.070 --> 05:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
being uh you know we're we're being uh
 
05:13:00.350 --> 05:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
inundated with new new technology new uh
 
05:13:03.910 --> 05:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
new rules with the the um the uh
 
05:13:06.750 --> 05:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and uh you know where
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
at every turn something new is happening
 
05:13:10.548 --> 05:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
that hasn't happened before uh we just
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
need a little Clarity and this brings
 
05:13:15.910 --> 05:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
Clarity to the uh to the to the
 
05:13:18.190 --> 05:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
statute thank you representative love
 
05:13:20.110 --> 05:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative love
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
from the committee members or
 
05:13:25.628 --> 05:13:25.638 align:start position:0%
people members attending
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
online me sorrya Lan I I I think
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative love rais is a good point
 
05:13:36.788 --> 05:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
but it and it's hard to describe um what
 
05:13:38.910 --> 05:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on is that we have so it's
 
05:13:41.470 --> 05:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
such a tight space that we have a hard
 
05:13:44.030 --> 05:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
time getting all the booths in and
 
05:13:47.628 --> 05:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
spaces between the booths and getting
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
and having the 4 foot minimum that's
 
05:13:50.280 --> 05:13:51.510 align:start position:0%
and having the 4 foot minimum that's
already

05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
required you would have to stand outside
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
where the socalled checkin is and that
 
05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
would probably be about 10 or 15 feet
 
05:14:04.910 --> 05:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
and so the six feet because there isn't
 
05:14:07.548 --> 05:14:07.558 align:start position:0%
a place that's six feet away that they
 
05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
would be able to sit and do that without
 
05:14:12.270 --> 05:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
actually being where the voting machine
 
05:14:15.750 --> 05:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
is on top of it or in where the people
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
are voting it's just so tiny so you
 
05:14:20.910 --> 05:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
would have to be in almost close to the
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
door where people walk in and that's
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
probably I'm guessing 10 to 15 feet so I
 
05:14:28.030 --> 05:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if that makes it clearer but
 
05:14:30.510 --> 05:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
I just think the six feet as long as
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
it's not instructed and you can see
 
05:14:36.590 --> 05:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on I think it's a I think
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
there would be no I just I'm afraid the
 
05:14:40.708 --> 05:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
six feet might be a problem for other
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
Wards like like
 
05:14:45.190 --> 05:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
mine thank you representative Lane for
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
the comment I'm not sure that's a
 
05:14:49.110 --> 05:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
question but it has caused me to ask a
 
05:14:52.830 --> 05:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
question because you're right the fact
 
05:14:55.230 --> 05:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
that you said booth made me think of
 
05:14:57.230 --> 05:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
something because one talks about
 
05:15:00.948 --> 05:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
counting a votes in this bill two talks
 
05:15:03.948 --> 05:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
about a the processing and Counting I
 
05:15:06.030 --> 05:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
don't think they were counting ballots
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the dairy Town Council room are you
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
talking about preprocessing yeah the
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
pre-processing so isn't it true then
 
05:15:15.310 --> 05:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill would make more sense to
 
05:15:18.110 --> 05:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
deviate the issues that representative
 
05:15:21.470 --> 05:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
Lane is bring if it was to be permitted
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
to observe the pre-processing of
 
05:15:27.270 --> 05:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots because they were not
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
counting the ballots that was the
 
05:15:31.310 --> 05:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
preprocessing when you're doing them on
 
05:15:33.788 --> 05:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
a election day you're at the polling
 
05:15:35.628 --> 05:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
place and it was one representative Lane
 
05:15:37.948 --> 05:15:37.958 align:start position:0%
said booth that I realized yeah wait a
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
minute we're talking about two different
 
05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
procedures yeah I I think that
 
05:15:45.548 --> 05:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
processing is is an effective processing
 
05:15:48.190 --> 05:15:48.200 align:start position:0%
alone is effective in addressing the
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
issue no no no no I think the point is
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Pomer bran the Town
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
Council room was only being used because
 
05:15:59.230 --> 05:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
they were doing pre-processing if you're
 
05:16:02.110 --> 05:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
at the polling place the ghouls already
 
05:16:04.868 --> 05:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
apply as to where you stand and can
 
05:16:08.868 --> 05:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
things yes yes so your intent was that
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
you didn't you had a
 
05:16:13.470 --> 05:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
preprocessing procedure that nobody
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
could really
 
05:16:17.708 --> 05:16:17.718 align:start position:0%
see yes ma'am I think that's accurate
 
05:16:19.510 --> 05:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
and they were not count they were
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
pre-processing the absent of
 
05:16:24.628 --> 05:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
balance that's an important distinction
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for bringing that up
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right makes sense now because
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
preprocessing sort of heard in a lot of
 
05:16:34.750 --> 05:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
different places as Town's had and I can
 
05:16:36.310 --> 05:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
see where maybe in some places they
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
didn't do
 
05:16:40.190 --> 05:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
it where you can see it I think we have
 
05:16:42.150 --> 05:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
a planning board counter that they might
 
05:16:43.990 --> 05:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
have wanted to use that might not have
 
05:16:47.150 --> 05:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
been if you were seated in a seat all
 
05:16:51.628 --> 05:16:51.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:54.150 --> 05:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
anybody all right I'm not seeing any so
 
05:16:57.310 --> 05:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
thank you to representative hant to
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%

happens when you pass
 
05:17:50.240 --> 05:17:52.070 align:start position:0%
happens when you pass
40

05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%

House Bill 3 72 uh it currently under
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
our election laws um if somebody steals
 
05:18:11.708 --> 05:18:11.718 align:start position:0%
your uh campaign sign um you go to the
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
police prosecutor and the with all the
 
05:18:16.350 --> 05:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
evidence you could have I I've had other
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
legislators say they have the video they
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
have uh Witnesses they have their their
 
05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
game cam you know the some neighbor
 
05:18:25.590 --> 05:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
plants uh their campaign signed in their
 
05:18:25.600 --> 05:18:26.628 align:start position:0%
plants uh their campaign signed in their
front

05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
front
 
05:18:29.628 --> 05:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
yard and they catch somebody on video
 
05:18:30.990 --> 05:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
you've probably seen the YouTube videos
 
05:18:32.430 --> 05:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
where some somebody runs up and steals a
 
05:18:35.470 --> 05:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
trump sign for example um that that was
 
05:18:38.990 --> 05:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
a a big thing for a while and they catch
 
05:18:40.390 --> 05:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
people on video they go to the police
 
05:18:42.070 --> 05:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and the police prosecutor
 
05:18:43.948 --> 05:18:43.958 align:start position:0%
says it's great you've got all the
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
you've got all the evidence right there
 
05:18:47.510 --> 05:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
I could take this right to court but in
 
05:18:50.830 --> 05:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh all of these election
 
05:18:52.910 --> 05:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
law violations including stealing a
 
05:18:55.628 --> 05:18:55.638 align:start position:0%
campaign sign goes through the Attorney
 
05:18:58.230 --> 05:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
General's office so if you steal any
 
05:19:00.670 --> 05:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
other sign that's not an election sign
 
05:19:03.070 --> 05:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
then the police prosecutor can take it
 
05:19:06.750 --> 05:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
but if you have so much as a a a sticker
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
that's uh advocating for any candidate
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
or issue um even if it's a local Town
 
05:19:14.548 --> 05:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
warrant um then it becomes a political
 
05:19:15.788 --> 05:19:15.798 align:start position:0%
sign and suddenly it goes to the
 
05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office so you'll call
 
05:19:19.628 --> 05:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office over an
 
05:19:21.310 --> 05:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
issue and I've had to call the Attorney
 
05:19:24.310 --> 05:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
General's office uh once or twice I
 
05:19:27.390 --> 05:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
received um some really serious threats
 
05:19:30.670 --> 05:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
from some antifa people who are
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
threatening by violence um you'll you'll
 
05:19:35.230 --> 05:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
contact them and they're very they're
 
05:19:36.830 --> 05:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
very busy and they're certainly too busy
 
05:19:38.788 --> 05:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
to handle something like campaign signs
 
05:19:41.230 --> 05:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
being stolen so every time I've brought
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
this up with some of the other
 
05:19:44.310 --> 05:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
legislators is certainly on the
 
05:19:46.750 --> 05:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
Republican side almost every legislator
 
05:19:50.070 --> 05:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
I talk to had some War Story during the
 
05:19:52.670 --> 05:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
campaign process where there were sign
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
stolen or some other election law
 
05:19:58.110 --> 05:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
violations and no one was able to
 
05:19:59.708 --> 05:19:59.718 align:start position:0%
prosecute the case because only the
 
05:20:01.350 --> 05:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office can deal with
 
05:20:05.390 --> 05:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
it can actually prosecute the case and
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
um even though they may have sufficient
 
05:20:10.350 --> 05:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
evidence um they can't go forward with
 
05:20:13.270 --> 05:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
an investigation so this bill
 
05:20:15.070 --> 05:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
essentially would just allow County
 
05:20:18.788 --> 05:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
attorneys U or Municipal prosecutors
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
usually from the police department to go
 
05:20:24.270 --> 05:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
ahead and and and take these cases up um
 
05:20:26.990 --> 05:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
the other much less common case is where
 
05:20:29.628 --> 05:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
you have evidence of voter fraud and
 
05:20:33.470 --> 05:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do there is is um
 
05:20:35.070 --> 05:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
essentially allow the county attorney's
 
05:20:37.350 --> 05:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
office or police prosecutor to
 
05:20:40.150 --> 05:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
investigate um we think that a majority
 
05:20:40.160 --> 05:20:41.628 align:start position:0%
investigate um we think that a majority
of

05:20:41.628 --> 05:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:20:44.510 --> 05:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
the um accusations or evidence of voter
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
fraud are just erroneous for example I
 
05:20:49.868 --> 05:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
received a complaint as a legislator
 
05:20:53.350 --> 05:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
this election that he saw the same
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
person come in twice at the same polling
 
05:20:59.030 --> 05:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
place and he thought he was a volunteer
 
05:21:00.670 --> 05:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
he thought that he saw the person cast
 
05:21:00.680 --> 05:21:01.548 align:start position:0%
he thought that he saw the person cast
ballot

05:21:01.548 --> 05:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
05:21:05.948 --> 05:21:05.958 align:start position:0%
twice um again the County Attorney
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
office and the municipal prosecutor
 
05:21:10.030 --> 05:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
might then have enough evidence to begin
 
05:21:11.788 --> 05:21:11.798 align:start position:0%
an investigation but current statute
 
05:21:13.948 --> 05:21:13.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't even allow them to investigate
 
05:21:15.750 --> 05:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
or complete an investigation and submit
 
05:21:17.390 --> 05:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
that to the AG's office everything has
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
to be handled through the AG's office um
 
05:21:23.548 --> 05:21:23.558 align:start position:0%
and as as usually that's uh they're
 
05:21:26.590 --> 05:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
they're much too busy so um where you
 
05:21:28.990 --> 05:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
have cases where there's evidence in New
 
05:21:30.868 --> 05:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in a particular town and it
 
05:21:32.548 --> 05:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
mean may have police detail there so you
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
may have police officers as the witness
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes the police prosecutor
 
05:21:39.868 --> 05:21:39.878 align:start position:0%
himself is there in which case he would
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
have to hand the case off because he's a
 
05:21:43.830 --> 05:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
witness who would have to testify in
 
05:21:47.470 --> 05:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
that case but whether it's a misdemeanor
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
violation or a
 
05:21:52.830 --> 05:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
felony um we haven't been able to go
 
05:21:55.868 --> 05:21:55.878 align:start position:0%
forward with these cases and just to
 
05:22:02.430 --> 05:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
kind of um improve the security and uh
 
05:22:03.990 --> 05:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
reliability and the faith that people
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
have in our elections uh process we want
 
05:22:10.708 --> 05:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
to be sure that um people from out of
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
state who might be eyeing New Hampshire
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
as a as an opportunity to come in during
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
our presidential election
 
05:22:20.788 --> 05:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
and um either cast a fraudulent Val
 
05:22:22.670 --> 05:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
Ballot or as we've seen on video many
 
05:22:25.110 --> 05:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
times people kind of drive in and steal
 
05:22:28.030 --> 05:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
some yard signs um we want to put a stop
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
to that and I think the there's a need
 
05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
for a deter deterring effect I was
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
contacted by about uh a dozen other
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
Republicans I've got a few co-sponsors
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
on this bill but about a dozen
 
05:22:40.430 --> 05:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
Republicans said that they wanted to
 
05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this bill we just I I could
 
05:22:44.788 --> 05:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
have filled this up if I wanted to make
 
05:22:48.030 --> 05:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
a hobby of that but um it it certainly
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
is a problem at least the campaign signs
 
05:22:52.830 --> 05:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
being stolen um there are lots of other
 
05:22:57.548 --> 05:22:57.558 align:start position:0%
election laws um but those are the two
 
05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
issues that that motivated uh
 
05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
introducing this built so as usual I'll
 
05:23:06.030 --> 05:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
take questions and I'm also as usual I'm
 
05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
willing to uh go do the leg work and
 
05:23:13.470 --> 05:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
committee that is kind of dark isn't
 
05:23:19.548 --> 05:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
it questions from committee members for
 
05:23:19.558 --> 05:23:21.230 align:start position:0%
it questions from committee members for
representative

05:23:21.230 --> 05:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:33.150 --> 05:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
electronically any questions oh I
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
probably should have uh mentioned in the
 
05:23:38.708 --> 05:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
bill um if you go to I don't I don't
 
05:23:40.110 --> 05:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
have it by a line number I just have the
 
05:23:44.910 --> 05:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
bill it's um I think it's
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
section down at the bottom where it says
 
05:23:51.070 --> 05:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
RSA 7 section 6-c which is just
 
05:23:53.430 --> 05:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement um that the last line where
 
05:23:58.990 --> 05:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
it says 668 section8 um RSA 7 section
 
05:24:02.670 --> 05:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
34- is County attorneys and um this
 
05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
would just add them in to that uh
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement and then RSA 41 section 10-a
 
05:24:11.310 --> 05:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
U just deals with the powers of
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
Municipal prosecutors so a municipal
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is not allowed to prosecute
 
05:24:18.310 --> 05:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh a felony case that would have to go
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
up to the county attorney's
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
office thank you for that clarification
 
05:24:27.868 --> 05:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
day uh I have a question from
 
05:24:32.190 --> 05:24:32.200 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair I'm um wondering
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%

um welcoming this additional
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility and and similarly to the
 
05:24:48.910 --> 05:24:48.920 align:start position:0%

05:24:53.110 --> 05:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
County attorneys in in this enforcement
 
05:24:56.430 --> 05:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility I I haven't spoken with u
 
05:24:58.910 --> 05:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
County attorneys directly I've spoken
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
with um legisl whove said that they've
 
05:25:04.548 --> 05:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
spoken with their uh Municipal
 
05:25:06.310 --> 05:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutors who've then said they'd like
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to take up these cases
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
especially the stolen campaign signs
 
05:25:11.910 --> 05:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
because they're not they're not able to
 
05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
go forward even if they have all the
 
05:25:15.510 --> 05:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
evidence even if they have witnesses in

Association of counties which includes

all your elected and appointed officials
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
including the County attorneys um to
 
05:26:17.230 --> 05:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
just briefly follow up on the question
 
05:26:18.430 --> 05:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the County
 
05:26:20.350 --> 05:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys have the bandwidth to take
 
05:26:23.350 --> 05:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
this on uh my discussions with them this
 
05:26:26.670 --> 05:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
week they do not have the bandwidth to
 
05:26:29.110 --> 05:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
take on this right now if you were
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
amable to amending the bill to removing
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
County attorneys and just leaving the
 
05:26:37.830 --> 05:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
municipals uh we are perfectly fine with
 
05:26:39.470 --> 05:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
that and we think that is probably a
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
more appropriate place um but I'm happy
 
05:26:43.948 --> 05:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
to take any questions I just since the
 
05:26:45.510 --> 05:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
question came up I wanted to make sure
 
05:26:47.430 --> 05:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
we were on
 
05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
record thank you very much any questions
 
05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
from Miss Morgan I'm gonna turn it over
 
05:26:55.830 --> 05:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
to representative McDonald have to leave
 
05:26:57.628 --> 05:26:57.638 align:start position:0%
hearing this
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
afternoon any question from M Morgan yes
 
05:27:03.110 --> 05:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
05:27:04.510 --> 05:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:27:06.830 --> 05:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
and for taking my question uh when you
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
see that the uh County attorneys that
 
05:27:12.270 --> 05:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
you've spoken to can't do the bandwidth
 
05:27:14.830 --> 05:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
how much does the heavy reporting
 
05:27:18.070 --> 05:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
requirements in this bill have to do
 
05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
with that conclusion uh most of the
 
05:27:22.788 --> 05:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
County attorneys figured that they would
 
05:27:25.708 --> 05:27:25.718 align:start position:0%
need to hire additional staff to just
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
deal with the reporting requirements in
 
05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
the bill um as you all can see requires
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
reporting about every six months um and
 
05:27:36.270 --> 05:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
so as you might imagine county
 
05:27:38.708 --> 05:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
attorney's uh budgets are very tight
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
right now and so they don't necessarily
 
05:27:43.788 --> 05:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
believe they have the ability to hire
 
05:27:46.830 --> 05:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
additional staff to do that
 
05:27:48.750 --> 05:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
reporting thank
 
05:27:52.150 --> 05:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from Miss
 
05:27:56.510 --> 05:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
Moran anyone on line yes award uh thank
 
05:28:01.110 --> 05:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question U Morgan the
 
05:28:05.310 --> 05:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
actual um investigation part of it says
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
that the prosecutor May at his or her
 
05:28:10.670 --> 05:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
discretion conduct the investigation so
 
05:28:13.990 --> 05:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
if the reporting part of it were reduced
 
05:28:16.948 --> 05:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
or eliminated would that then be
 
05:28:19.548 --> 05:28:19.558 align:start position:0%
acceptable to your clients uh I would
 
05:28:21.788 --> 05:28:21.798 align:start position:0%
have to take that back to them uh
 
05:28:23.390 --> 05:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative but I'm happy to do so
 
05:28:26.030 --> 05:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
and report back to the committee thank
 
05:28:28.270 --> 05:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
you he I actually called on
 
05:28:29.830 --> 05:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative Ward you have your hand
 
05:28:29.840 --> 05:28:31.670 align:start position:0%
representative Ward you have your hand

05:28:33.030 --> 05:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:28:34.830 --> 05:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
question I was just wondering if County
 
05:28:37.948 --> 05:28:37.958 align:start position:0%
attorneys hearings and take
 
05:28:40.350 --> 05:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm sorry you broke up just a
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
little bit and there I missed the middle
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
part of the question I'm sorry I was
 
05:28:46.150 --> 05:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
just wondering if County attorneys hold
 
05:28:47.948 --> 05:28:47.958 align:start position:0%
hearings and take
 
05:28:51.948 --> 05:28:51.958 align:start position:0%
testimony uh so they would take
 
05:28:54.910 --> 05:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
testimony as in part of a
 
05:28:58.670 --> 05:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
prosecution um but that that would be
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:04.948 --> 05:29:04.958 align:start position:0%

05:29:07.030 --> 05:29:07.040 align:start position:0%

got a I was just alerted by a
 
05:30:01.270 --> 05:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
constituent who's watching our our
 
05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
hearings today um online that um a
 
05:30:07.110 --> 05:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
reference was was made in testimony
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
earlier today about a hypothetical
 
05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
fraudulent voter from
 
05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
Islamabad um which you know would invoke
 
05:30:15.190 --> 05:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
the notion that Muslims shouldn't be
 
05:30:17.868 --> 05:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
thought of I guess as full citizens and
 
05:30:19.750 --> 05:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
that you know I know is a false view
 
05:30:22.310 --> 05:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
that everyone in this committee would um
 
05:30:24.788 --> 05:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
certainly reject and I just wanted to uh
 
05:30:28.510 --> 05:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
