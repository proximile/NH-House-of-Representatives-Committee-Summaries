morning we are a bit late because of

morning we are a bit late because of
technical

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
technical
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
difficulties uh the chairman is running
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
late and asked me to start this at 10:
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
and due to technical difficulties uh it
 
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
is virtually
 
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
10 so uh HP
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
297 uh non gerain Amendment and I'd like

counsel I want to go a step further
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
Beyond just introducing the two
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
individuals here to either side of me
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
they have done incredible hard work in
 
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:28.519 align:start position:0%
designing the program that we're going
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
to talk about this morning they have
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
done a lot of research they've thought
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
through a lot of things we've gone
 
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
through thousands of drafts uh they've
 
00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
done really good work here I'm
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly grateful for the effort that
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
they've put into this project a project
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
that I strongly believe in and I
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
strongly believe in it because I think
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
it is going to be able to help the
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
people of this state be able to afford
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
their home insurance
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
premiums so very quickly why are you
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
seeing this before you as a non-gain
 
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment so when we made the decision
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
as a department to bring this um
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
proposal forward because there is a
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
budgetary impact it made sense to me to
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
include it as part of the Department's
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
proposed budget as an item within House
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 we actually had to make that
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
decision back in the late summer early
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
fall the elections took place
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
legislative leadership was selected and
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
so we had a meeting with the leadership
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
in both the House and Senate and I
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
basically asked them how they wanted us
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
to approach this particular program I
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
explained to them why I thought it was
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
an appropriate House Bill two item but I
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
said we will engage this process however
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
you would like and the two pieces of
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
feedback that I got were we'd like to
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
see as much detail behind this program
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
as possible in the statute so don't go
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
looking for some
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
you know broad Authority around a
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
framework in statute via the rules
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
process rather put as much detail into
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
the proposal itself and then if there
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be rule making later that's
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
fine but we want to make sure that the
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislature has appropriate and
 
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate understanding of exactly
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
what this program is and exactly how it
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
will work so that's why the amendment
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
before you is a bit meaty and the second
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
thing the leadership instructed us to do
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
was to to take this proposal through the
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
policy committees to have it
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
appropriately vetted and so here we are
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
in front of the most important policy
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
Committee in the
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
house so in any event I'm pleased to um
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased to present to you this
 
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
morning our proposal for the granted
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
State home mitigation and resiliency
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
program the slide deck in front of you
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
I've really tried to keep this
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
fundamental and simple and then we can
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
go into as much detail based on the
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
questions that you have as you would
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
like so very very simply what is the
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
problem as I've discussed with you
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
before homeowners are facing the burden
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
of soaring insurance premiums in
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
increases thereof which has created a
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
formidable barrier to people not only
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
being able to maintain their home
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
insurance coverages but it's also hurt
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
home ownership as well because as you
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
know it is a
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
condition of a bank that you have
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance coverage in order
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
for them to issue you a mortgage so you
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
have to have it and so the problem again
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
is the increasing premiums for
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance coverage which
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
again is putting strain on strains on
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
family budgets individuals budgets is a
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
barrier to home
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
ownership it's becoming a real
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
problem so what are the causes of the
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
problem well here again we've talked a
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
little bit about this before industry is
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
working its way through what is
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
currently a hard market and so insurance
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
companies are adopting a more selective
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
approach to the risks that they are
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
willing to underwrite and again that
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
leaves consumers having to navigate an
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
increasingly challenging environment
 
00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:18.519 align:start position:0%
where they either have to go to a new
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
carrier that again is not offering them
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
the same affordable premiums as they had
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
before or they're being non-renewed
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
entirely within the admitted market and
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
so what they're having to do is go see
 
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
coverage in the Surplus lines Market
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
which is very very costly for them some
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the contributing factors to this as
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
again we've talked about before are
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
things like inflation interest rates the
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
global supply chain disruption
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
litigation costs um and the large
 
00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
catastrophic weather events those are
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
the component pieces of what's driving
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
the current hard Market this
 
00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
contributing again to companies being a
 
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
little bit more restrictive in their
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
underwriting and so therefore causing
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
there to be not as much access to
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
Affordable coverage as existed
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
before so not to blow too too quickly
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
through the presentation here but I
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
think I've described the problem I've
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
described the causes of the problem and
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
so here's where this program comes into
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
play put very very simply what we would
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
like to do is to create what essentially
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
will be a dedicated
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
fund this is a proactive program I want
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
to be very clear about that this is not
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
a postd disaster type program this is
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
not anything that femo would do or hsem
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
here at the state level this is a
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
proactive program by which we would
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
create a fund and the fund would be the
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
dollars that would go into that fund
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
would be the first million dollar that
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
the department collects through the
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
insurance premium
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
tax would go into this fund and then
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
consumers would be able to apply into
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
the fund on a first come first sered
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
basis for Grants upwards of
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
$110,000 to be able to undertake some
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
improvement of their home and
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
property the good news is we are not
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
blazing a trail here this is a program
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
that has been undertaken I Believe by at
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
this point seven or eight states either
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
have these programs currently in place
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
or are in the process of standing them
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
up so we know the program works we have
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
some data as to the benefit the program
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
has had in those states that being said
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
I think the state that's had it the
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
longest is Alabama and Alabama's had it
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
operational for only about 2 years years
 
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
so we have some data but not a ton of it
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
not because it doesn't exist but because
 
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
again the program has not been in
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
existence long enough for us to be able
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
to have a comprehensive set of data for
 
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
you but I think by virtue of the fact
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
that you see a lot of members of
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
Industry here both those who represent
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers more broadly and some
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the carriers are represented
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
individually here who are here in
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
support of this program it is a
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
testament to the fact that the program
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
achieves the objectives and the
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
outcomes that it is set out to achieve
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
which is to provide relief to homeowners
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
for their homeowners insurance premiums
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
so of the data that we have in Alabama
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
over 60,000 homes have been fortified
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
they've issued 8,000 grants in Louisiana
 
00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
North Carolina they've seen lower
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
premiums and insurance discounts for
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
proactive homeowners and again there's
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities for savings both in terms
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
of better positioning yourself in the
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
underwriting to get a lower premium but
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
then there are also companies that offer
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
a wider range of discounts up front if
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
you are able to make certain
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
improvements again to your home or
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
property so some of the more prominent
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
projects that would be eligible for
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
funding via this grant would be things
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
like fortifying your roof for ifying the
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
exterior of your home if there is
 
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
foundational work that can be done to
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
better protect the home from
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
floods that would be eligible and one of
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
the things that I think is going to have
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
the most benefit to the most number of
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
people is it makes eligible to things
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
that could be done on the property
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
itself to make the home safer and the
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
most prominent example of that is that
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
large tree
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
that is hanging over the house or has
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
very large limbs that are hanging over
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
the house and because of the size of the
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
tree and the height of the tree it is
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
expensive to get rid of it and so
 
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
therefore becomes cost prohibitive to a
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
lot of people so in this instance the
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
individual would be able to apply into
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
the fund would be able to get that tree
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
taken down for
 
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
$3,351 and I cite that because that was
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
what my folks had to pay to have a big
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
old tree taken down in the front of
 
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.029 align:start position:0%
old tree taken down in the front of
their

00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
property and for that
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
fairly um that that fairly inexpensive
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
investment there they're going to be way
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
better positioned in underwriting and
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to save on
 
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.149 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to save on
their

00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
premiums so we're excited about that
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
because again the million dollars is the
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars and we're we designed
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
this program in a way where we're trying
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
to have have those dollars assist the
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
greatest number of people and so not
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
every Grant is going to be for the full
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
10,000 there will be a lot of other
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
smaller projects that'll be well below
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
that threshold that will be able to go
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
out and again while it's small
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
dollars for them it's a huge impact in
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
terms of their long-term affordability
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
for coverage so we're excited about
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
those um aspects of the
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
program so at this point I'll just pause
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
Emily or Christian is there anything at
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
this point critical that I've missed
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
before I get into some of the other
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
highlights I think
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
you my team says I've done well so far I
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
guess I'm on a roll
 
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
um so in any event we're trying to start
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
modestly uh it is a million dollars
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
which is not obviously nothing um but
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
again we're going to find ways to make
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
those dollars count we have also heard
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last year to year
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
and a half a number of rumors uh coming
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
from Washington granted there are always
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
rumors coming from Washington but we are
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
hearing that there is some interest in
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
Congress to make some uh block granting
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
available to States for these programs
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
either to start them or to be able to
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
put more resources into currently
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
existing programs so we will have them a
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars of State funding that
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
will go in every year and you will see
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
there that we have asked for any unspent
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
dollars for I think the first three
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
years or was it five five for the first
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
five years to roll over simple reason
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
being that it takes time for word of a
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
program to get out to the public so
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be an educational aspect of
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
this as well and we're working very
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
closely with the New Hampshire Home
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
Builders Association uh to let their
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
folks know that there will be
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities for their contractors to
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
be able to do more work and that this is
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
a program we hope they will have
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
conversations with the individual
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
consumers that they work with or
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
interact with to let them know that this
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
program is available for them to take
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
advantage of so we're hoping that we'll
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
have a very aggressive Grassroots
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
communication strategy so that folks
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
will know of the existence of this
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
program but uh we'll have the dollars
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
that are unspent roll over for the first
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
five years and thereafter any unspent
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
dollars will go right back into the
 
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.950 align:start position:0%
dollars will go right back into the
general

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
fund so we'll be judicious with the
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
money as well but should the federal
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
government make additional dollars
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
available because the program exists
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have a vehicle we'll be able to
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
drop those dollars right into and at
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
that point we'll come back and probably
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with you about
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
adjusting some of the eligibility
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
criteria to be able to again impact uh
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
even more positively impact even more uh
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters but we're going to start
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
modestly because the dollars are modest
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
and then we'll build out from there as
 
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
the situation should
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
dictate go ahead oh I would also mention
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
too again the idea being to have the
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
dollars that we have in this program
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
impact the people who are most in need
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
of it uh there is a means test testing
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
component to the program our means
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
testing criteria is identical to the uh
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
home heating assistance program weather
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
the weatherization program that the New
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy overseas
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
and administers we thought that um
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
adopting a model that worked well that
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
we knew worked well for one other state
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
agency in a somewhat similar uh related
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
subject matter would be beneficial
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
certainly we hope it's something that
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable and familiar with so
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't reinvent the wheel uh we went
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
with something that had been tried true
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
and tested uh so again there's means
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
testing there we want to make sure that
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
we're targeting the people who really
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
are the most in need and who would most
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
benefit from having some support via
 
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.149 align:start position:0%
benefit from having some support via
this

00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
program so that all being said from my
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
perspective Ive again I think there are
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
a number of wins and benefits to the
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
program first obviously lowering
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
people's homeowners insurance
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
premiums at worst keeping them out of
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
the Surplus lines
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
Market but also not to be lost is the
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
fact that people are going to be living
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
in safer homes and that is a benefit in
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
in of itself and so people's homes their
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
properties will be safer for them safer
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
for their families safer for any members
 
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
of the public who may have reason to
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
come on to that property so that's good
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
as well inl look while I appreciate the
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
fact that um the home builders are
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
busier than ever these days uh this will
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
also be an opportunity in the periods
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
when they're a bit down or when the in
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
that industry is not going quite as Gang
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
Busters it'll be a good opportunity for
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
them to have steady consistent
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
work uh to engage in and again help the
 
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
consumers of the
 
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
state so representative Hunt is here
 
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
I've done my job I F A Buster just long
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
enough for you to get here Mr chairman
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot to this program
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
obviously and I know that this will go
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
to work session when it goes to work
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
session we are going to invite in a
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
gentleman by the name of Brian Powell
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
Brian Powell used to be the deputy
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner of the state of
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
Alabama he is actually the
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
brain behind this program Alabama was
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
the first state to stand it
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
up uh I've engaged therefore in my
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
favorite uh uh kind of work which is R&amp;D
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
ripoff and duplicate uh We've improved
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
it I think we have taken a different
 
00:27:17.389 --> 00:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
approach uh than some of the other
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
programs have again to try to address
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
not just helping a home become certified
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
ibhs standard but again for those who
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
are not quite as ambitious to go in that
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
direction to be able to take on smaller
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
projects that are still going to be very
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh to them a Brian was
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
poached from Alabama to work for the
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
National Association of insurance
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
niic and his job all day every day that
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
he is there is to assist States in
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
designing and bringing these programs
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
online he has been a tremendous asset to
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
us as we were designing our program
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
um I think we challenged some of his um
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh previously held beliefs about how
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
some of this can work I think we've
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
broadened his Horizons and a the result
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
of that is we've been approached by
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
three other states who have said we
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
understand that you're looking at this
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
in a pretty interesting way in an
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
Innovative way would like to understand
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
what you're doing which is great and I
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
think two of those states are our
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
Northern New England neighbors because
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
we've really tried to New Hampshire eyes
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
this program obviously the types of
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
weather weather threats weather
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
potential uh is a lot different in New
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than it is in Alabama or
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
Louisiana or Florida all of which have
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
either exactly this program or something
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
similar to it uh so our Northern New
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
England Partners want to know what we've
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
done because obviously we share a lot of
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
the same weather uh characteristics so I
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
really think we're on to something very
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
very viable something very Innovative
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
but we'll make Brian available to you
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
during the work session he can really
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
dive into the detail of any questions
 
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
that you have and again he'll have the
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
benefit of being able to tell you all of
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
the experiences and the background and
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
the stories
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
behind why we've done certain things in
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
in a lot of ways we've done them either
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
because they've worked well in other
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
states and Brian would be able to speak
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
to that or because it didn't work so
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
well uh in some other states and there
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
again Brian will be able to uh bring you
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
through the detail of all of that but
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
for today certainly happy to answer as
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
many of your questions as we can uh
 
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.950 align:start position:0%
many of your questions as we can uh
represent

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
shes so um thank you Mr chairman thanks
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
for a question so as the bill 297 FN
 
00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:48.519 align:start position:0%
what is I mean the first part of the
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
bill relates to the employer health
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
benefits which is health insurance
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
company and then second part of the bill
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about home
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
insurance uh what's the I I would say
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
just out of the block I'm sorry I have a
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
I have a history no my question is why
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
comb that history where it says purpose
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
and policy that's gone Mr chairman I
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
think what he's speaking to I think he's
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit tripped up he came in a
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
little bit late when I explained why
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is a non-gain Amendment oh so it's
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
a non-gain Amendment because when we
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
originally were approaching this program
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
we had it as a part of our house bill
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
two requests and then we got feedback
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
back from leadership in the House and
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
Senate that they wanted it to go through
 
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
the committee process so that the
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts all of you had
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to vet it so what we
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
needed to do was to find some Bill that
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
we could attach this to so that we could
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
have this non- gerain bill hearing and
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
there would actually be a vehicle for it
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
to move forward to house finance I
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
assume if all of you are in support of
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
this program so yes the title of the
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment are two totally
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
separate subject matter uh subject
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
matters but this is the way we had to do
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
it in order to make it all work for the
 
00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
process you have we got the feedback
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
from leadership about how they wanted us
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
to approach this after the bill you okay
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
with that do you understand okay so
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
basically we have a process here in
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
which um in terms of when we amend bills
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
in Committee in the subcommittee and we
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
amend bills the bill the amendments are
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
directly related to that issue of that
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
bill now over the years um and and let's
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
say the Senators taken more advantage of
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
this than we in the house do which is
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%
that they'll take any Bill and they'll
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
take any other issue that had nothing to
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
do with it and slap it on that bill okay
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
so we have a policy here in the house
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
that says that if you're going to do
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to take a n a
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
nerain no words it's not anything to do
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the title of the bill or the
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
original purpose of the bill or whether
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
the original sponsor even knows that
 
00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:05.799 align:start position:0%
were doing it through their
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill okay that we're taking an amendment
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
we're adding to it but we're having a
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
proper public hearing so no one can ever
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
said this thing came out of nowhere I
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about this or have
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
we had a fair opportunity to discuss
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
and thoroughly thrash out what the
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is and whether it's
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate for public
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
policy okay I mean maybe we can talk
 
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:33.799 align:start position:0%
more detail during the subcommittee uh
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh that time but I'm I'm still having
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
hard time understanding that I
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
understand the technicality of this what
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
you why you're doing is okay but the
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
point is that because these two are two
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
different subject matters yes and uh
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
somebody could be opposed to the first
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
part while somebody could be okay with
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
the second part how are they going to
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
vote on the B so what we do when we get
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
into the subcommittee yeah we can talk
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
we we we will thrash out both pieces
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
okay okay and and and uh the underlying
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
Bill uh I'm not sure remember what the
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
about so so so the sponsor does know
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
bill know about this non Amendment okay
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
okay and this uh and the simple little I
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
would say that one of the reasons why we
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
chose this bill is because both the both
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
both these issues are something that the
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
department is requesting okay so the
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
underlying bill that it was a simple
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
little Bill that it's an ongoing issue
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we have um that you know that that
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
we will we will discuss both pieces and
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
so theoretically in subcommittee or in
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
the full committee we might decide to
 
00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
accept one or the other or neither you
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
know so we'll we'll have that choice but
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
so I would say is um if you were to look
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
at the title of the bill now what you
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
want to do is say the the bill now has
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
two analysis has two different issues in
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
it yes and and because we've had this
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
non gerain hearing okay that's fine I
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
think I'm good for now but we can talk
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
later on on this fair enough
 
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.510 align:start position:0%
later on on this fair enough
representative

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr share um is anyone is
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
the insurance department or anyone going
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
to testify um on the original
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
Bill yes representative I I believe that
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
bill has been heard we we already had
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
that here
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
in thank you I forgot
 
00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.790 align:start position:0%
in thank you I forgot
okay

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
okay silly thank thank you for taking my
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
question can you you may you may have
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned it but can you please repeat
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
who is going to administer the program
 
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
is it part of your depart if it's part
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
of your department will you need
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
additional headcount I didn't see that
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
so the department will administer the
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
program for us we're going to dedicate
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
one individual to do it I have the
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
position already I'm going to repurpose
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
a currently existing position uh for
 
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
administering this program and what we
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
foresee and we'll obviously need to work
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
with treasury in terms of getting the
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
dollars out the door that's not my
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
understanding is anything unusual M us
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
are signed quite frequently between
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
agencies and treasury to make sure that
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
everything flows and works exactly as it
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
should but really for this individual
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
within the department it will be taking
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
the grant applications ensuring that
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
the application is in alignment with
 
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility the eligibility criterias in
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
the program and then again as I've said
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
it's a first come first serve basis so
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
this individual will start with the
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
applications at the top go through get
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
to the Million dooll number and then we
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
will probably uh put forward a system
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
that will hang on to the applications
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
that we've received that were not
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
approved because the funds had been
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
expended already and we'll check in with
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
the homeowner as the opportunity for
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
them to reapply becomes available the
 
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
next year to see if they want their
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
Grant to remain under consideration or
 
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's not needed anymore
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
because they either decided to do the
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
work themselves
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
or you know the tree that they wanted to
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
get rid of went down on its own
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully not into their house but uh
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's a first come first serve basis the
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
one individual who admin it will just be
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
taking in the applications making sure
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
they're eligible and then communicating
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
with treasury to get the dollars out the
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
door okay so but to answer your question
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's a very important question who's
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to administrate and who's going to
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
do this okay yes they're going to find
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
an in-house position this bill if we
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
decide to go forward with it with this
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is going to go to finance and
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
finance might say no we don't want that
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
position at
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
all and and this bill will die you know
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
then you know die and and they might get
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
rid of that position but that will be up
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
to finance in terms of figuring out how
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
makes more sense to operate the
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
department but then they would have to
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
follow up to make sure the work was
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
completed as contracted well I would at
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
this point if they weren't willing to
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
fund the position no if they do if they
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
fund the position the position and this
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
person goes out to say oh look the tree
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
came down the tree has been removed
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately yes there will be a the
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
idea is you're doing it ahead of time
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is I keep turn to saying because I
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
did get a a phone call from a former
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
legislator this is um proactive rather
 
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.670 align:start position:0%
legislator this is um proactive rather
than

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
reactive so in terms of proactive is is
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
that the the pro the program is in place
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
that it's in there so it's up to the
 
00:37:49.319 --> 00:37:50.550 align:start position:0%
that it's in there so it's up to the
individual

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
homeowner to say I want to take
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
advantage of they proactively they need
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
to apply and then uh in terms of then
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
making the making sure all the Hoops
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
have been jumped through and everything
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh the money comes from the fact that we
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
already have a tax you know for the the
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh insurance tax so it's not uh but that
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
I mean reality is I don't think this is
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
going to get used a lot uh a is people
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
might be in denial whether it exists and
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
how well they Market it and let
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
everybody know it exists but B is most
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
people love that big old tree and just
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
think it's the most beautiful thing in
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
the world and it pains them to think
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
that maybe they should cut it
 
00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
down but at this case if they they
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
didn't cut it down and it falls on top
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
of their house they can't blame they
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
only have themselves to blame for not
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
taking care of that I just wanted to
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood the process so
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
they apply for the grant which it
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be paid back and they
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
say I'm going to take down the old tree
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
right they get the money but then they
 
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
never take down the tree oh
 
00:38:59.470 --> 00:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
yeah program for that Emily's going to
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
speak to that piece if I might so we
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
have a position in the department
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
currently that is currently funded we
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
would just repurpose that position for
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
administration of this program so
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's no new money in terms of
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
personnel what I also mention to my
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
friends over at house finances I've
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
already defunded three positions
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
full-time and two part-time positions so
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
I've really tried to do my part on the
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
position front now despite the fact that
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much good it does them
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
since we're a self-funded agency but I
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
got into this Spirit of what they were
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
looking for so hopefully they'll let me
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
keep this currently funded position and
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
again so how do we make sure no one
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get scammed and if I
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
could I'll just direct everybody to page
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
four line 17 that's going to be there in
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
out um um as the commissioner noted um
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
the proposed 407 E9 is the provision
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
that speaks about the payment of the
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
funds and so under that provision the um
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
applicant would have to show that um all
 
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
the work had been completed and it
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
requires um certain things including a
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
copy of the signed contract a copy of
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
the itemized work and a sworn affidavit
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
from the contractor who performed the
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
work um so we are um the bill proposes
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
including safeguards to make sure the
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
work was actually
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
completed and again that's a model that
 
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
we borrowed from the other programs and
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
so far as we can tell in terms of the
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
feedback that we've gotten that
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
provision has worked very well to ensure
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
that the work is done and that nobody's
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
making off with the dollars there's also
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
some Provisions in here that say that
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
the payment will be made post the work
 
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
being done but we understand that in
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
some cases the contractor is going to
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
need some upfront payment in order to be
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
able to procure the materials that are
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
needed to do that work so there'll be
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
those doll will be made available
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
upfront so the work can begin then the
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
rest of the payment will follow once the
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
project is done so those um safeguards
 
00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
are present and as I've said based on
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
the experience of the other states they
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
have worked
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
well okay yes representative
 
00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.589 align:start position:0%
well okay yes representative
Herbert

00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
Herbert
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
um is there any uh anything in this uh
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
project that might be able to
 
00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.430 align:start position:0%
project that might be able to
generate

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
generate
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
cash um outside of the
 
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
insurance uh coverage in other words if
 
00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.470 align:start position:0%
insurance uh coverage in other words if
somebody

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
has $6,000 project and you say fine and
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
you do the project can the person that
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
had the project say uh would it be okay
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
if I spent some of my own
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
money uh and you know a million bucks is
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
going to go fast M so I'm just trying to
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
think of any AD avenues that might be
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
available to generate uh cash sure I
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
think if I've understood your question
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
correctly so the the dollars from the
 
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
grant program can be used but it's not
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
like that's as far as the project can go
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
so for example if you need a brand new
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
roof depending on the size of the home
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
but let's say it's a single family ranch
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
style uh roof um that's probably going
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
to run you somewhere in the neighborhood
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
of about
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
$20,000 right so you're going to have
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
the 10 from the grant that you'll be
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
able to bring to bear but obviously the
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
homeowner is going to have to account
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
for the other 10 in order for that whole
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
project to be complete um as you'll see
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
here there's kind of two tracks that the
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
consumer can choose to go on there's the
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
track to be uh
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
ibhs certified gold star standard and
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
again depending on the house that's
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
probably a longer term project there are
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of aspects that go into meeting
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
all of those standards you're not going
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
to be able to get there just on a
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
$10,000 Grant from this program but
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
obviously the grant can be helpful and
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
if you do have the resources as as an
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
individual homeowner that you can bring
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
to beay you may be able to fully tackle
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
all of the components that go into that
 
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
all of the components that go into that
ibhs

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
ibhs
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
certification but for those who don't
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
want to go down that comprehensive route
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
again have created a second track where
 
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
people can take on smaller more modest
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
projects that again while small
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
seemingly to them is going to end up
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
paying them significant dividends when
 
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
it comes to underwriting getting renewed
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
getting quoted for a premium not getting
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
tossed into the Surplus lines Market uh
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
so I I I hope that was your question
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
like I like that answer the big the
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
savings is going to come when they get a
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
cheaper right homeowners policy because
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
they've addressed that problem right
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
right representa Ammon thank you Mr
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for coming and
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
testifying I just want to understand the
 
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
position sort of piggybacking on what
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
representative teresia had asked um
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill 297 the original bill is not
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
part of the amendment right the
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
amendment says amend the bill page one
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
line six amend the bill by replacing all
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
after section one with the
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
following the the following is the the
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
gr State home mitigation and resiliency
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
program the original Bill appears
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the text of this as far as I
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
can I can see so the original bill is is
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh gone yeah we may have to make an
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment there I think we drafted this
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment as though it were an
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
assignment we typically get from you
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
which is to say we need you to rewrite
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
this bill so I I think that's why that
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
language was there but no we certainly
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
do want to keep the underlying policy
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
matter um originally included in House
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
Bill uh 297 and then have this as part
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
of that as
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
well okay okay after section all
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
so the former commissioner is still
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
taking good care of me over
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
here so the original text of House Bill
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
297 is all contained in that section one
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
representative so the amendment as it's
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
written would just tack this on but
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
preserve what's currently there in 297 I
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
see so the the Roman numeral 5 on the
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
original bills is still going to well
 
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
this is a good time for everybody to
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit of how crazy our
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
legislative process can be if you look
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
at the bill you'll see it says on line
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
six amend the bill by replacing all
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
after section
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
one so if you go back and look at the
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
original bills section one the original
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and then it says uh
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
um then and then now section two so it
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
it is a little uh when it says replacing
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
with the following so that that means
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
they try to fix the title amand The Bill
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
replacing all after section one the key
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
element there is that these little
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
numbers on the on the left hand side and
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
you would say we'll see some other bills
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
like Department bills where that'll be
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
up to 10 or 11 cuz are all these
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
different sections of the bill that that
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
they're taking in but uh the key element
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
is each section is going to flow with
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
one RSA it's going to be one thought in
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
terms of as an RSA is listed so just a
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
followup yeah so all after section one
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
on the original bill it's it's really
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
only talking about line 24 of the
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
original bills the effective date that's
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
replaced correct so that's really what
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's replacing it will be the effective
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
date which I think was a problem with
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
the orig bill in the first I think there
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
was going to need to be an adjustment
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
there anyhow yeah it's a little wonky I
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
mean not to complicate matters I suspect
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
what'll end up happening is if we are
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
able to get you all comfortable with
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
this program you move it along it's
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to go to house finance and house
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
finance will probably cleave off this
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
program from 297 and consider it within
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
the larger context of House Bill 2 and
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
everything else that they're working
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
through right now is good so this is
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
another thing we need to bring up for
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
your freshman okay uh when it comes to
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
the budget we actually have two bills we
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
have uh House Bill one and House Bill
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
two House Bill two is also is known as
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill because it implements
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
everything that's in house bill one
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's known as the Christmas
 
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
tree and where everything all the
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
different issues are all dangling off
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
this wonderful tree
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
so representative buros has a question
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
I have a question I have a constituent
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
who lives in a flood zone she has a
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
house and actually she is the mother of
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
somebody in this committee and um that I
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
don't care what you do to that house
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
that house is going to fall into the
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
river one day so would people in those
 
00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
situ situations where climate or
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
flooding is going to be inevitable would
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
this program um be U available to them
 
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
because of the particular
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics of where the house is
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
located it's probably going to be tough
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
for them to ever be able to position
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
themselves to do well in underwriting
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's probably incredibly difficult for
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
them to get flood insurance I assume
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
they have to go through the national
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
flood insurance program and if they
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a policy through them I don't
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
know who this person is beg them to do
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
it uh whatever you do don't let them
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
have the assumption that they've got
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
flood insurance coverage via their
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
underlying homeowners coverage way too
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
many people make that assumption and
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
then disaster strikes and they are some
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the most Miser able conversations I
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
have to have with constituents because
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
they've just lost everything they
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
thought they have coverage and they are
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
completely out of luck what was the
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
agency so it's the national flood
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
insurance program it is a federal
 
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
program obviously backstopped by the
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
federal government that makes flood
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
coverage available to individuals who
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
cannot get coverage in the commercial
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
Market because of where they happen to
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
be located which if they're in a flood
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
plane and you're fear is that eventually
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
that home's going to fall into the river
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to go through
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
nfip so Mr musk hasn't eliminated that
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
agency yet not that I'm aware of not
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of would you
 
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.870 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of would you
believe

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much all right very
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
good I got one card
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
here from the
 
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:55.510 align:start position:0%
here from the
former

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner yeah and DJ uh can you make
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
sure there's a card you guys made a card
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
thanks chairman hunt members of the
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee I'm going to teach hold on a
 
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.030 align:start position:0%
committee I'm going to teach hold on a
second

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
yes yes represent Spirit the um the
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's going to go to
 
00:50:14.789 --> 00:50:14.799 align:start position:0%
paying for the program I thought it was
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
like a 100,000 or 200,000 was a million
 
00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:20.799 align:start position:0%
okay so it's going to come out of the
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
premiums premium tax the premium tax
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
ordinarily that money would go into the
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
eneral fund
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
correct okay so the finance committee
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
could very easily that's why this is
 
00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:35.559 align:start position:0%
this exactly okay so this all might be
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
for not but we're we're giving her
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
College try yes good morning Chris
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt members of the committee
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Chris nicopoulos uh I'm here
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
representing the National Association of
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
mutual insurance companies which is one
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
of the largest trade associations for
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
PNC insurance carriers some 60% of uh
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance written in New Hampshire is
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
written by by one of our members uh and
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
we're here to support uh the
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner's Amendment on this bill uh
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
we've seen a number of states adopt
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
resiliency or fortified home bills that
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
have been very effective uh there are a
 
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
number of states looking at including
 
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
Maine is looking at funding a program
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
with nearly $15 million in the ld1 the
 
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:15.990 align:start position:0%
with nearly $15 million in the ld1 the
governor's

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
budget uh this plan though it's not a
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of money will allow
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to test what was
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
successful in Alabama ultimately Alabama
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
put a program in like this has had an
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have cat losses and it's
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the houses that were fortified
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
as compared to the houses that weren't
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
and there was a drastic reduction in
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
claim level for those houses uh and so
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
the industry is supportive of the
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner's efforts I'm happy to
 
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
questions represent a thank you for your
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
testimony um if this is such a good idea
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
why doesn't the insurance industry fund
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
these these programs
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
good question representative uh because
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
this is it's good for everyone right
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
it's good for all of our uh citizens to
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
have U Better Built Homes uh an
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
insurance company in any given case
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
can't afford to uh uh fortify a home you
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
know think of what your uh home owners
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
premiums are as opposed to a 10,000
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
Grant I there's not sufficient money
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
there uh to do that I think ultimately
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
taking a money from the premium tax is a
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
roundabout way to to test this program
 
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
but ultimately I think the good of
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
citizens in total benefits from that it
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
fund thank you very much thank you all
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
right having no more cards I will close
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
the uh public hearing on the non- gerain
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.319 --> 00:52:54.150 align:start position:0%
 
297

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
297
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
so uh While most of the committee
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
members are here um just next week we
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
will be doing subcommittees on all these
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
early bills so this but we will be
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
taking this bill up next
 
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
week and because it's just a
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um we can have we can we
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to have a big the
 
00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:19.799 align:start position:0%
big committee room so um I might I I
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
have the availability of room
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
104 which is down on the first floor so
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
that uh that we'll do use that on
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I'll just decide which ones
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
I put in put in there
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
so Tuesday and
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
week don't go far right
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay you want to give me your cell phone
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.599 --> 00:54:45.069 align:start position:0%
 
person

00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up to public hearing and
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
hear from the prime
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor reg uh representative stringing
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
I I guess before we get too far into
 
00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
this um I want to make sure everyone
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
everyone in the room knows that we've
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
already had a hearing on the issue so
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
let's put it this way I would I'm fully
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
confident that the committee
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
members understand the problem so what I
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
would have you do is focus your
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
discussion on why you think this bill is
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
the right answer rather than the other
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
ones so you feel free to contrast but
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
again and is is uh let's you don't have
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
to explain to us the problem we for some
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
of us who have been doing this for a
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
very long time I know the problem very
 
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:37.799 align:start position:0%
intimately but for new members I think
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
pretty well everybody's pretty well up
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
to speed good morning uh good morning
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and esteemed
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
members of the Commerce uh committee and
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
725 uh relative to ground ambulances
 
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.029 align:start position:0%
725 uh relative to ground ambulances
services

00:55:57.029 --> 00:55:57.039 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Jerry Stringham I'm a
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
representative from Lincoln Woodstock uh
 
00:56:05.069 --> 00:56:05.079 align:start position:0%
Easton and Livermore um my personal
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
background includes over 25 years as a
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
consultant in healthcare reimbursement
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
systems uh particularly related to
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
various fee schedules relating to things
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
like Physician Services Hospital
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
outpatient services and so on uh so that
 
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
gives me some uh some uh relevant
 
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
experience uh for this different Fe
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
schedu Bas mainly the ambulance services
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh this bill uh does two things extends
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
the prohibition on balance billing uh to
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
ground ambulances services and
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
establishes a non-contract rate for
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
ambulance services for those insured
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
with commercial uh health plans at 20 at
 
00:56:50.029 --> 00:56:50.039 align:start position:0%
325 per of the Medicare rate for those
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
plans that that have not negotiated a
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
rate uh with that particular ambulance
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
provider uh obviously this isn't an
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
ideal situation uh this is a service uh
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
that uh New Hampshire rights have been
 
00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
used to getting uh without uh having
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
additional uh these additional monies
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
being needed and whether the money uh
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
comes from insurance companies whether
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
public or private uh from the patients
 
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
themselves or from property taxpayers
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
we're talking about new money here uh
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
and this is this situation has been
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
created uh and I know we've talked about
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
it a little bit uh as the ground
 
00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh business model has broken
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
down and has been discussed in this
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
committee and uh part of the
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
presentation on two other bills one of
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
which I testified on uh so the old
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
business model has collapsed uh and
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
services uh providing ambulance care
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
have shut down in working on last uh
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
bance budget for four ambulance
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
providers had gone belly up in three
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
months during the time we were working
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
on the budget and obviously uh that
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
caught everyone's attention including
 
00:57:58.039 --> 00:57:58.870 align:start position:0%
caught everyone's attention including
this

00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh at the same time the
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
crippling impacts of a single ambulance
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
ambulance bill can still financially uh
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
ruin an individual uh and E efforts to
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
extend the prohibition of balance
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
billing uh because of the problems with
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
the business model and ground ambulances
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
have not yet extended to that so uh I
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
think we saw uh the commissioner's Bill
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh while using a different model to
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
to uh make up the Lost uh funds that are
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
needed uh uh still also uh included a
 
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
balance uh billing prohibition as this
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
bill does as
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
well uh uh the ambulance um this bill
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
provides ambulance service providers
 
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:46.039 align:start position:0%
with sufficient Insurance reimbursements
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
to stabilize their business and protect
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
our ambulance riding consumers from
 
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
Financial ruin at the same time and
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's basically the two purposes we're
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
we're trying we're uh approaching here
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh the Bill's uh sponsors have been part
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner's ambulance study
 
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
which led to the publication of the New
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ground ambulance cost study on
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
December 23rd uh which is additional
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
information that's available and I would
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
like to uh uh congratulate both the
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
authors and the insurance commissioner
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the uh work that's been done
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
there uh it's an important study that
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
underscores some of the challenges faced
 
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
by the business model for ambulance
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
services for example uh in establishing
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
the cost of the services it assumes that
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh the ambulance providers will continue
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
to receive funds from towns and donors
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
at the same level so uh that means uh uh
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's still money outside of those
 
00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:47.039 align:start position:0%
paid by the people who are actually
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
getting the ride and I know I have five
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
t-shirts at home that's a a lywood
 
00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance running 5K on them and uh uh
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh so you know the these are uh often
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
Charities that uh do receive money
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
outside of um uh the payments they
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
receive and uh this cost study assumed
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
those would continue to be on there uh
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
and uh um you know that was part of the
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
questions that came up on that um the
 
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of balancing uh uh the the idea
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
of continuing to have the balance
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
billing in place uh in part was meant to
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh create um sufficient incentives for
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and providers to
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
still have a re reason to negotiate so
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
if somebody gets a bill uh for thousands
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
of dollars for an ambulance ride that
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
they weren't even awake for and didn't
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
even ask for uh they go go back to the
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
insurance company and soon sooner or
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
later there could be some some
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
resolution in there the idea of having
 
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.109 align:start position:0%
resolution in there the idea of having
the

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
325 which according to my records here
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
in some cases will be more than than
 
01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:02.039 align:start position:0%
than the invoice so the actual payment
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
would still be below that amount um uh
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
would provide sufficient Capital that uh
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
we can we can get rid of that that
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
incentive in there um and uh you know
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
using the cost study the anticipated
 
01:01:21.029 --> 01:01:21.039 align:start position:0%
cost to an insurer uh in in in the
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
insurance model the insurance model is
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
about 36 cents per member per month that
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
is how insurance companies generally
 
01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
think about is a program expensive or
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
not uh this model would probably be
 
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
closer to 60 per member per month or
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
about $7.20 a year uh in premium uh
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
although uh you know I think that's open
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
to some some discussion um again this uh
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
again this would only apply to
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
non-contract providers there's nothing
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would prevent an Anthem Sigma or
 
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
any of those insurance companies from
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
negotiating uh a rate uh with with the
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
providers directly uh you know this
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
model uh uh provides no cost to the
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
state taxpayers I think the my my
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
reading of of uh the commissioner's
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
model which uh asks that all insurers
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
pay the same amount uh would mean that
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid rates would go up so there
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
would be some impact uh to state
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers which I'm not sure uh there's
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
a stomach four right now uh and my
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
experience in working with Medicare uh
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
in fee schedules and waivers is that uh
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
is would be very difficult to get
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
additional money from Medicare
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
specifically targeted in New Hampshire
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
when they do waivers it's
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
typically uh the state comes up and says
 
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
you're providing this much money for
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
services uh but you want us to pay this
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
much for transport and this much for uh
 
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
emergency care we would rather just lump
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
Summit we want to do it we want to
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
spread the money around differently we
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to use your fee schedule and
 
01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
they often ask for waivers so when we
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
talked at the last meeting about the
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
Maryland program Mar Maryland is has a
 
01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
waiver and doesn't use the drg system
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
for paying hospitals uh for that
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
specifically that reason in 1983 when
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
the system came out they said we don't
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
like that system and we wanted to use
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
our own and said if you can meet your
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
cost production targets you can continue
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
to do that and amazingly to all of us 42
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
years later they're still doing it so um
 
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh if if my understanding is of the
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner's bill and I guess we'll
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
all come back uh uh in subcommittee and
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
and review the three bills that were put
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
together um uh you know I I do think
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a a flaw or that would
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
have to be addressed um
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
I I do think unfortunately it is normal
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
for commercial rates to be higher than
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid and um uh so um I
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh onepay uh systems are quite quite
 
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
unusual uh so as I said I understand the
 
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
three bills addressing the topic will be
 
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
discussed uh and I um I'm sure any of
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
them could be uh a move to get something
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
that'll work from the ambulance
 
01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.230 align:start position:0%
that'll work from the ambulance
providers

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
and for our citizens that unfortunately
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
need a ride from time to time uh with
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
that I will open up to any questions
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
that you may have I know we have a lot
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
of other experts here to speak as
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
well representa
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
SES so um so thanks for a question I
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
have actually two- part question first
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
is based on experience current in the
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
current system the way you are doing
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
balance billing what percentage of
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
balance billing you are able to recover
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
that's first question and second
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
question is that how are you going to
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
address the ambulance services to people
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
insurance um so let's see one question
 
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
is how how how do ambulance service
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
providers handle their customers that
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance there a second
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
question the first was in the current
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
balance building system that you have MH
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
what percentage you able to recover from
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
the balance billing do you have
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
information on that uh there is there
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
there are some recoveries that get that
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
way but in in Lincoln Woodstock I know
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
the numbers are not significant I mean I
 
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
mean so you don't have any ballpark like
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
50% 25% there there'll be other people
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
testifying and we'll have one of them
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
give you a hard a harder percentage Yeah
 
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
and in terms of under uninsured get
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
bills and whether they pay them or not
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
is uh uh
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
um uh is
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
often a matter of litigation so
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
so representative Amon thank you Mr
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your testimony um
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
you're welcome just because I don't know
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
what the term means I'm I'm asking so I
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
three it said I I'll read the whole
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
sentence if a claim that a health
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
carrier receives for ambulance service
 
01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
provided to a covered individual by a
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
non-participating ambulance service
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
provider is not a clean claim what what
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
does a clean claim
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
mean uh well in the way I would use
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
clean claim is sometimes a claim comes
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
and it has all the information like what
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis is uh the information that
 
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
the insurance company would normally
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
need to see to make sure that this
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
patient is eligible uh for insurance and
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
that it's a diagnosis that's appropriate
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
for the type of service that's been
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
given I'll give an examp example of a um
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're putting in the non the
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
non-transport as a uh reimbursable event
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
but uh the if if an ambulance service
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
goes to uh say a car crash and uh the
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
person just waves them off and said I
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
don't want to see anything uh there's
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
been no medical intervention provided
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's actually still would not be
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
billable but if they put hook an IV in
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
they give somebody Nar can uh then they
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
say they don't want then that would be
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
billable so there would need to be a
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
claim with adequate uh documentation so
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
that the insurance company should
 
01:07:38.269 --> 01:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
process the claim and to me that's what
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
a clean claim is and if if they have to
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
send it back for clarification then it's
 
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
an unclean
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
claim okay any other questions see none
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
much uh chair will'll call on Michael
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
satar from the New Hampshire Association
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
of Fire Chiefs he didn't say he was for
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
or against the bill but I'm going to
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
going to guess that I had it in the
 
01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:13.269 align:start position:0%
going to guess that I had it in the
right

01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
four if you don't mind I have Chief Ed
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
Walker with me he's uh there are two of
 
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
us in that does he have a card in with
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
oh good great I like
 
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.910 align:start position:0%
oh good great I like
that

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
perfect all right good morning my name
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
is Mike Zar I'm the chief of the Tilton
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
norfield fire district and I'm
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
Association of Fire Chiefs my
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
counterpart is Ed Walker he's the Chief
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
Peter Barrow and representing the fire
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
chiefs as well today we're here to speak
 
01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:47.799 align:start position:0%
in favor of
 
01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
725 and the reason the the bottom line
 
01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
is what we want to do is help reduce the
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
impact to our taxpayers in our community
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
and every penny that we can get from the
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies going towards the
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
cost of the services that we're
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
providing is going to reduce the tax
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
impact to our taxpayers that's the
 
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.030 align:start position:0%
impact to our taxpayers that's the
bottom

01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
line and to uh to further speak to that
 
01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:12.759 align:start position:0%
the the two strong points with this bill
 
01:09:16.269 --> 01:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
are the 325 per and we're handing out um
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
the full testimony you see in the bottom
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
the 325 per Alliance close to what a
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
number of other states in the country
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
have chosen to be a percentage relative
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
to the Medicaid rate um which is a
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
fairly established rate some of those
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
even here in New England and the other
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
part of this is the by establishing this
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
state rate it also helps with in
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
educating with other insurers or with
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
other parties about what a fair and
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate is um for reimbursment
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
to help recover some of those costs
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
have okay any questions
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%

thank

01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
you here you go thank you uh again thank
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair committee my name is Derrik
 
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
Alman from hookit I am the President of
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Ambulance Association
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
um we do stand in support of this bill
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
however um my esteemed colleague uh
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
Chris staz will testify to our um
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
components of uh our support I did see
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Aon I appreciate
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
your question on what a clean claim is I
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
do have some uh you know written
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
documentation in front of you that we
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
would ask that you consider you know
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
when we discuss what a clean claim is
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
because that term has been weaponized by
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance agencies and we really
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
feel that that is something that when
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
you move forward you know with any
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
consideration using that term um and I
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
can go through this line by line you
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
certainly have it in front of you if
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
chairman we're going to discuss this in
 
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so just give me the
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
highlights or what do you think think
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
ISL the most Salient important items we
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
certainly give it what a definition of a
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
clean claim is you know to what we
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
expect you know what is reasonable and
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
what a reasonable standard that would
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
apply to what a clean claim is um we ask
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
for you know the process that would
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
occur when a clean claim is provided and
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
a timeline that when a clean claim is
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
provided as to when the um provider
 
01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
could expect payment and what the
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
expectation would be in the event that a
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
clean claim did not happen and then
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
because of our experience and certainly
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
my peers in the aom medical industry
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
could have testify to this the um the
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
idea of a clean claim being weaponized
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know if they do not perform we're
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
looking for some Financial impact in the
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
form of a penalty you know and the
 
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
number that I give here is not only the
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
cost of the claim but a 100% increase on
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
that you know claim and plus
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
25% so I think there does need to be
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
some Financial penalty because otherwise
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
we do have experience that the insurance
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
companies will just sit on things delay
 
01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
it you know and call forth their you
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
delay okay so I'm going to throw this
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
question out for you but it's really for
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
everybody to think
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
about is there anything else in the fire
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
department which you can balance bill
 
01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.350 align:start position:0%
department which you can balance bill
with

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
now did any other is there a fire in
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
which you can Bill somebody a balance
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
bill for because you had to bring your
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
trucks had to you know take care of them
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%

01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
trying to be brief so I I know we'll be
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
at a work session um so the New
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ambulance my name is Chris day
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
was I'm a board on the board of
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
directors for the New Hampshire
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Association the um Association
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
supports H Bill 725 it would end the
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
need for balanc billing in New Hampshire
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
once and for all which I and and we
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
believe fill the revenue Gap that would
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
be created by ending it as I've
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
previously testified we do not believe
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
other ambulance reimbursement bills
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
being considered that by this committee
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
would accomplish that in a way that is
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
financially responsible to either the
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
consumer or the provider or
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
both the this is not about inequity
 
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
between Medicare or Medicaid
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates those are important
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
but separate issues it's about
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
maintaining a neutral Revenue stream for
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
all ambulance providers if they are no
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
longer allowed to balance bill in our
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
ambulance Summit meetings last year with
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
the insurance commission the state was
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
unable to determine the amount ground
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers collected by balance
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
billing the PCG report expertly details
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
the actual costs of the services however
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
for all of its analysis it seemingly
 
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
fails to determine or reveal that amount
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
either and that is the absolute heart of
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
the matter at hand I believe all agree
 
01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
that the financial gap that any
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
prohibition to collects balanc billing
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars creates needs to be bridged the
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal health of every ambulance
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
provider in New Hampshire depends on it
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
particularly in rural areas we believe
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
that 325 of Medicare will bridge that
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
Gap and not result in a significant
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
health insurance premium increase or
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
spend it is a fair compromise that does
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
not place any undo additional burden on
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
the community providing the service the
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
consumer or the ambulance provider and I
 
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
look forward to working with you in work
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
group or subcommittee group to come up
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
solution oh representative miles thank
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:15:54.639 --> 01:15:56.669 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:56.679 --> 01:15:57.669 align:start position:0%
question
is

01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
325 that is in this bill is this what
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
you need to maintain EMS
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
services to the very rural areas and
 
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
sick population in this state is this
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
enough we believe that this would be a
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
neutral amount if we were if the ability
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
to balance bill was taken away from the
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
providers which we all want to do MH
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
that 325 would make up that Gap okay
 
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
will it prevent operations from
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
closing I don't know the answer to that
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
this as I said this is one piece of a
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
giant puzzle um and the focus of this
 
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
piece is ending balance billing without
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
financially harming providers or
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
you represent Teresa so I thank you for
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
question uh I bring the same question
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
that I asked previously since you
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you are going to with
 
01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
this bill you're going to bridge the gap
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
between the balance billing and uh and
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
the amount that the department receives
 
01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
so would you have any information about
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
what percent of balance billing are you
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
able to recover right now is it 50%
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
25% 100 75% any any information that's a
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
great question that percentage varies
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
widely by the type of a provider that is
 
01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
doing the balance billing um there are a
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
number probably more than half of the
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in New Hampshire are
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
small you know less than 20 person
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
operations that um are probably not very
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
well bursted in in the billing process
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
so their ability to collect is um not as
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
good as others could be I don't know an
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
exact number as I said these reports
 
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
were not able to determine that so we
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
don't have an idea uh we know how much
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
cost to provide the service but we don't
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
have a true idea of what that Gap is so
 
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
it differs from Ambulance Service to
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance service or so do you have any
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
average at a state level that you're
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
able to recover so much amount I do not
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
no that's that's the magic number I
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
think we're all over the years we've
 
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
used the numbers 30% don't
 
01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:21.270 align:start position:0%
used the numbers 30% don't
30%

01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
30% any other questions see none thank
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
you okay let's change Pace uh Sabrina
 
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
Dunlap from Anthem in opposition to the
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
is thank you chairman hunt and members
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
of the committee I will be brief
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
appreciating that there will be more
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
conversation on this um
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
I I think it's it's tough to say 325 is
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
a compromise I'm still unclear on where
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
that actually came from and the way the
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill is written functionally that will
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
set a rate of 325 per. I know it lists
 
01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities um can set their own rate
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
but I don't know why anyone would set
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
something lower than 325 so functionally
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 325 per of Medicare
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and you know I think we appreciate
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
the Bandon balance billing also
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
something we want uh again I want to
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
emphasize that is something that comes
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
from the provider to the member I think
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's a misunderstanding sometimes
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
that it's the insurance company that's
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
sending that bill to the member so
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
obviously we support that as well I
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
think I'm confused by the section on
 
01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
prompt pay and the comment that um clean
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
claim is weaponized I don't know what
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
that what that actually means there is a
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
very clear statute on this already for
 
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
20 j8 um there's lengthy provisions on
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
prompt pay clean claims
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
is is defined already so I don't
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
understand how this would help
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
um and I think again we are talking
 
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
about a very small piece of the pie and
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
Chris just said that and it's true that
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
um you know Medicare and Medicaid and
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
people who aren't insured are a big part
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
of this as well as our municipalities
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
and chairman hunt you said that at the
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
insurance department Bill hearing as
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
well that this is a section of of
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
healthcare that is just different and it
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve the municipalities and I
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
think to put you know this set rate on
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
just the fully insured Market I don't
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
think that's fair I don't think that's
 
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
neutral um so I think we would be in
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
favor of further discussion on the
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
insurance department bill you know I
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
think that did the deepest dive we've
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
seen so far on the true costs for
 
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
providers um so obviously happy to talk
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
more happy to take any questions thank
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
miles thank
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
you you're from antham oh I'm sorry I
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
did not introduce myself Spina D I am

the senior director of government
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
relations for Anthem I apologize do you
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
currently have Hospital uh ambulance
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
contracts we do yes so can't you set
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
your own rate for yourself with why why
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
do why do why are you against this it's
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
if if you're able to set your own
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
contract rate
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
we do negotiate with ambulance providers
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
to try to bring them in our Network and
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
we negotiate those rates I think to set
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
a rate like this for out of network
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
providers um I don't think this is a
 
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate and it also
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
disincentivizes any ambulance providers
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
to come into our Network which we are
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
always trying to do because it helps our
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
members to have ambulance providers in
 
01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
members to have ambulance providers in
our

01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
Network or exit or not have a contract
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
do number someone say well pass this
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
legislation then well correct yeah I
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
think this would drive ambulance
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
providers out of our Network I think
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
that would be a consequence of this bill
 
01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:08.629 align:start position:0%
that would be a consequence of this bill
as

01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much thank you chair
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
we'll call in Justin
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:25.719 align:start position:0%
holderness my name is Justin no you got
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
to turn it on button there we go sorry
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Justin van etton I serve
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
as the chair of Stewart's ambulance
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
where the largest rural provider of EMS
 
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh I also serve as the
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
chair of Municipal resources we consult
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
with municipalities throughout the
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
Eastern Seaboard um comparing the two
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
bills uh two issues that I wanted to
 
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
bring up the first is I've been meeting
 
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
with cities and towns Boards of
 
01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
Selectmen City councils for the last
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
three months about this and one of the
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
questions that I hear most frequently is
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
the difference between the two bills is
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
$3 per year for an insured it's
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
relatively small amounts of money but
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
the amounts of money that are property
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are being asked to pay for is
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
significant why is it that there's only
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
a $3 per year extra cost between the two
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
bills for insured and there's a heavy
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
heavy hit on property
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and my understanding of this
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that the nhid only regulates about
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
half of the insurance in the state of
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the other half are states
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts Rhode Island
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
Connecticut all of these other insurance
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
and when they set a cap um what is going
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
to happen because all of these huge
 
01:23:50.189 --> 01:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
insurance companies operate in multiple
 
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
States right so if 316 goes through and
 
01:23:55.629 --> 01:23:55.639 align:start position:0%
they say it's two times Medicare what we
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
know what we've seen happen time and
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
again is that you know these gargantuan
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
insurance companies ABC insurance
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
companies they're going to say well the
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
rate for New Hampshire is two times
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare we're going to pay that same
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
rate now for our insured in
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the towns the property
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are all going to have to flip
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
the bill for the discount of the
 
01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts insurance and the New York
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
State insurers are going to get a huge
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
discount under Bill 316 and again are
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers are going to foot the
 
01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
bill Rhode Island insures huge discount
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
once again and our property taxpayers
 
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
are going to flip the bill and so that's
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
one of the big challenges with
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
316 is we are
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
inadvertently um and unintentionally
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
providing huge discounts to out of state
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
insurance and we're asking our local
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
communities to pay for it through their
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
property tax payers now I've talked to
 
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner about it he said that's
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
outside of his purview and he's
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely right it is but I think we
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
all have to be cognizant of what the
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
impact of our actions are going to be
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
Anthem is not going to say well our
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts insureds are going to
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
continue to pay more it's just the
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
discount we're going to give to New
 
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire policies that's not the way it
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
happens um and so that's why taxpayers
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
are property taxpayers that is are going
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
to get hit so hard um if you try and cap
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
it at two times Medicare because quite
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
frankly representative to answer your
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
question ma'am um 325 is not enough to
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
keep EMS agencies from going out of
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
business 325 of Medicare is not enough
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
to prevent a lot of property tax payment
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
increases um but it is a compromise and
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
I will tell you what I like the most
 
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.030 align:start position:0%
I will tell you what I like the most
about

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
725 is that it respects that we have an
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
electoral process here in New Hampshire
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
voters show up in the booth and they
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
elect their Boards of Selectmen and they
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
elect their city councilors and those
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
Boards of Selectmen and those City
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
councilors are stewards of the people
 
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
that have elected them and these folks
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
get to choose what the right rate is for
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
their Community mind you it's capped at
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
325 which I find to be hard that say
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
Stewartstown is going to be treated the
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
same as Manchester
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
but it's locally elected representatives
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
and from what I can see of 316 and I
 
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
struggled to wrap my head around this
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
are we really going to say that
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and insurance
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
company executives are better stewards
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
of the interests of our residents here
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire than locally elected
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
select people and City councilors I feel
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
like personally having inter right I
 
01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
trust my Selectmen they're doing it
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer and prob Bono why wouldn't
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
they be given the option of choosing the
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
right amount for their community and if
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
they choose the right amount for their
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
Community why shouldn't insurance
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
companies have to fund this why do we
 
01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
have to do everything on the back of
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayers so that is my
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
two points thank you very
 
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:15.639 align:start position:0%
much uh representative
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
for coming in to testify this morning um
 
01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
I have two questions uh the first is
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
that that this bill um provides more
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
than twice the Medicare rate it provides
 
01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.709 align:start position:0%
than twice the Medicare rate it provides
for

01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
325 per of the Medicare rate uh so
 
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that reduce the impact on
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers absolutely this is a
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
significantly better Bill than 316 um
 
01:27:46.030 --> 01:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and my second question is um
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
you said that uh 3
 
01:27:51.629 --> 01:27:51.639 align:start position:0%
125% uh wasn't enough but we've heard
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
from representatives of the ambulance
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
service providers who said that
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
325 looked to them like a reasonable
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
amount why are you more uh qualified
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
than the providers themselves to say
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
what's a reasonable amount for the
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
providers great question ma'am um I'm
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
not better qualified that's just my
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
personal opinion but what I will say is
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
the 325 IS I believe the standard that's
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
used in seven or nine other states in
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
the United in the United States and it's
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
325 or higher in in those communities um
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
personally when I look at this I would
 
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
suggest that a place like Stewartstown
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
um is going to have significantly higher
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
costs than say a Manchester or a
 
01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
community that's an hour and a half from
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
a hospital might have a higher costs
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
than a community that has a hospital in
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
it I would love for there to be some
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
sort of a pressure release valve or
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
something so that these communities that
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
are very rural that are very strapped
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
under their property tax burdens could
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
maybe pick something higher than 325
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
followup question further question may
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you uh but if Manchester
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
costs less and stewarttown costs more um
 
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
but basically all of the um non-contract
 
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers are going to get
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
325 unless they buil for Less um
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it balance out for the
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
um it would Statewide but it would still
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
leave just picking on Stewart Town
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
example it would still leave stewartown
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of a hole potentially
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
that has to be paid by their property
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so I have a question for you
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
when we talked about what the insurance
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
department really regulates is only 20%
 
01:29:45.639 --> 01:29:47.709 align:start position:0%
department really regulates is only 20%
50

01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's going to be more like 30
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay s okay and I think there's at least
 
01:29:58.109 --> 01:29:58.119 align:start position:0%
another 30 is Arisa plans self-insurance
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
plans why do you and who are not going
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
to be affected by this legislation at
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
all at all why do you think it's fair to
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
make the small businesses who are in the
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
fully insured plan to
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
pay for those larger insurance companies
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
who choose not to be
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
regulated because they're not going to
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
be paying this high fee they get to
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
negotiate they get to do their own rates
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're exempt from this
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
legislation so you're saying you think
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's because that 30% of small
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire that have
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
the fully regulated plan they should pay
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
the $7 mhm to make up for the fact that
 
01:30:48.669 --> 01:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
that other 30% of people who are fully
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
insur insured through their employer are
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
exempt it's a great question Mr chairman
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
and I apologize the 50% number that I
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
was talking about is our experience and
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
my interactions with the the
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner so when I've gone through
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
our data with the commissioner both for
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
the company that I represent but as well
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
as the municipalities what we have found
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
is that the insurance companies that are
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
under the nhid by an order of magnitude
 
01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
pay the lowest amount of money in fact
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
the single largest payer under the
 
01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
regulations of the state of New
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pays less than both Medicare
 
01:31:27.639 --> 01:31:28.709 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pays less than both Medicare
and

01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and so that has been the
 
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
challenge the regulated plans and and in
 
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
my conversations with the commissioner
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
it probably inappropriate for me to put
 
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
words in his mouth especially when he's
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
not here U but when I've talked to him
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
about this and I've showed this you know
 
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
I I'll show him that the regulated
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
insurance company is paying less than
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
the State Medicaid Program plays and the
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
unregulated plan is paying seven times
 
01:31:55.629 --> 01:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
what the insurance company B that's how
 
01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
it exists
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
today and I think what we're trying to
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
do is bring some level of parody um and
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's one of the comments that he's
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
made publicly was you know we shouldn't
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
have one insurance company that simply
 
01:32:13.229 --> 01:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
be because they're the largest
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
everywhere they get to pay 70% less than
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
the other insurance companies and all
 
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies should be
 
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
treated with some sort of equity and
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
just because you're the biggest doesn't
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
mean you should get paid the less and in
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
fact in the 2011 study that was done by
 
01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see there was a high degree of
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
parity amongst all the insurance claims
 
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
everybody paid believe it or not even
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
back then it was between three and three
 
01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
and a half times Medicare but all
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim and Signa and United and
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
Anthem they all paid the same amount and
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
what's happened over the last 14 years
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
is that the largest insurance companies
 
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
have paid far far less for ambulance
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
transports and that's put a bigger
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
burden on the Harvard pilgrims of the
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
world and so this plan also brings a
 
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
level cuz you're right absolutely right
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
chairman it's not fair for these
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
regulated plans to cover so much less of
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
their cost than the other insurance yes
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't even talking about just the
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
regulated so you're only you only
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the regulated yeah and
 
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
anthem's regulated plans yes okay well
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
sign as far as I know they don't they
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't have anything that's regulated so
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know right now is only small is only
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
larger employers arises yes so therefore
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
they're not even in the game they're not
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
01:33:31.109 --> 01:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
legislation at
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
all representative spear you thank you
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
uh you've listed a bunch of numbers
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
there that don't quite compute to me
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
compared to other studies that we've
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
seen can you give us some backup for any
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
of this that explains something because
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're mixing apples and oranges and it's
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
not getting clear at all as to where
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
some of these numbers I mean for
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
instance it's you made a claim that it's
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
not fair that
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
building you know that that Anthem is
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
paying less and less but that could be
 
01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
for any number of reasons that they're
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
paying because they have fewer people in
 
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
network could be all kinds of reasons so
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
I would like to see some backup data but
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
what you've said absolutely uh
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
representative um I will tell you the
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
level of parity uh was from a study and
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's public again 2011 commissioner
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
cini's office I believe um did it and
 
01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
that lists out what the insurance
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
companies are paying for varying levels
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh or for ambulance calls and so you can
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
see in 2011 what Signa was paying what
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
Anthem was paying what all of these
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
companies um I work I don't know
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
probably 30 communities uh here in New
 
01:34:50.189 --> 01:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
England so I see it firsthand I'm happy
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
to share some of this information the
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
insurance department has not released
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
publicly a further study um since 2011
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
that shows what it is but we see
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
firsthand um and I've brought the
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
invoices to hearings here before that
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
will show you these large insurers
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
Program representative Gibbs thank you
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if there are some insurance
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
policies that are Exempted from this
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
type of Regulation because of Arisa
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
which is a federal law that occupies the
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
field for certain types of um insurance
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
plans is there anything that the state
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislature can do about
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm not aware of anything that the
 
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
state can do um so the answer is no
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
correct thank you very much thank you
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%

01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning hunt members
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
of the House Commerce Committee for the
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
record I'm Paula Rogers and I represent
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance plans
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance plans is a
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
trade Association representing the
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
interests of insurers and I may have a
 
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
battle within my membership because we
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
have Mr van etton talking about Harvard
 
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
doing this and Anthem doing that and
 
01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:21.159 align:start position:0%
saying things that quite frankly I'm
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
puzzled about and interested to hear
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
more about because he may have
 
01:36:27.629 --> 01:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
statistics and sources that are deeper
 
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
than mine but I'm I'm when I signed up I
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
thought well am I opposed or am I in
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
support well I'm not I'm somewhere in
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
the middle and let me tell you why so Mr
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
vanon and I and Mr stay and I well Mr
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
staywise and I go back at least to 2008
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
I think and Mr van a little later than
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
that and so we th the three of us um
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
have seen an array of discussion before
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
this committee and other committees
 
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
about what to do about ambulance so the
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
positive part is that something needs to
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
be done because we can't keep having
 
01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
these discussions they become more and
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
more aggravating and and no solution
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
sort of emerges so we have 316 and 725
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
we have two bills coming over from the
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
Senate and we have the insurance
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
department study and we have others
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
saying 325 per of Medicare will take
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
care of most of the present tension in
 
01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.629 align:start position:0%
care of most of the present tension in
the

01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
system I think the charge to this
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
committee is a significant one because
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
the expectations are high and so I guess
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
my sense is that while insurers in
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
general certainly don't like great
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
setting um the reality is we sense
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
something's going to happen this session
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
on the house side and so I think we all
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
need to kind of settle down and engage
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
and you need to listen to us to a degree
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
but you have a lot of information you've
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
already gotten you're probably going to
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
get more and
 
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
um I just you know I just quite don't
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
know what else to say except that um we
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
want to continue to work with you and we
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
want to be reasonable and we want to
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
keep people sort of level in their
 
01:38:29.709 --> 01:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
expectations and in their statements
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
because sometimes we hear things that
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
sort of startle us and so that's all I
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
have to deliver today but I really look
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
forward to it and I know this committee
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
is going to have its hands full so I'd
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
be happy to try and answer questions
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
represent miles has a question thank you
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:38:51.149 --> 01:38:51.159 align:start position:0%
question nothing being
 
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
perfect could you get get to the point
 
01:38:55.709 --> 01:38:55.719 align:start position:0%
where you could
 
01:38:59.550 --> 01:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
say this is a good
 
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
compromise obviously because I represent
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
an association and different plan
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
members are within it um I would have to
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
consult with them I just think it's
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
clear from the membership I have that
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
although on the record they will oppose
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
right setting the reality is they know
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
they want to be involved in any
 
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
discussion because it's important to
 
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
everybody uh the people behind me no
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
matter what side of the issue they rest
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
upon um something has to be done and I
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
want to address if you don't mind a bit
 
01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
of a question you had I think to Justin
 
01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
van etton about the North country and I
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
know there's some North Country people
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
here and on the committee I guess I
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
haven't really looked at everybody's
 
01:39:43.149 --> 01:39:43.159 align:start position:0%
biography yet this year but I I didn't
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
ask that but the reality is um always
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
over those years there was a sense my
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
sense that the North country did need
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
some special ATT attention and I think
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know internal to companies that were
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
doing the negotiating I think there was
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
always that representation that long
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
distances fewer clients that were
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
insured really do put stress on North
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
Country operations so I just wanted to
 
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
share that reality and understanding of
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.550 align:start position:0%
that particular
situation

01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
followup represent Barz uh thanks for
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question I am a North Country
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
person um I live in I live in the White
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
Mountains and how much I I we were
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
talking somebody was talking before
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
about the um out ofate people and I live
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
in a in a community where tourism is
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
huge how is that impacting us well it
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
depends C where the um billing party is
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
if they're out of state they do not have
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
to honor supposing you split the
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
distance and say oh it's going to be
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
275% whatever and a bill passes they
 
01:40:54.510 --> 01:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to honor that um um the other
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
problem with out of state carriers is it
 
01:41:00.669 --> 01:41:00.679 align:start position:0%
puts a burden
 
01:41:00.679 --> 01:41:02.270 align:start position:0%
puts a burden
on

01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
the ambulance people when they bill and
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
I noticed that in the bill before you
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
this morning there's an attempt to sort
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
of grab on to something about what is a
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
clean claim because when you're doing
 
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.270 align:start position:0%
clean claim because when you're doing
longdistance

01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
longdistance
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
negotiations um and you become
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
frustrated um I can understand wanting a
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
standard about what a clean clim is and
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
when it needs to be paid under a
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
deadline and on that point I'm glad you
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
brought it up because there are clean
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
claim Provisions in the insurance code
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
more on the Pure Health side and not on
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
the ambulance side and if you're going
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
to move in that direction you may want
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you mail them in a way
 
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
that makes sense or at least make a
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%

we've evolved over the last few years
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's been important um so a little quick
 
01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
history and then we're not we're going
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
to try to get through this really
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
quickly chesher EMS was a all uh came to
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
be two years ago um when we our major
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
vendor um closed it was in business for
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
60 years it was uh $2
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
million lean on to the IRS and it was
 
01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
shut down there's a lot of reasons for
 
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
that reason but the bottom line is we
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
had a decision there's some people in
 
01:43:21.589 --> 01:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
this room that we look to to see if they
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
would they would actually come over and
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
take on the service the last thing we
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
actually wanted to do was take on this
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
service but that's the reality that's
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
where we are today we are um two years
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
in as I said but really one year as a
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
real operational um because the first
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
year we did just uh interf facility
 
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
transfers and a few a few
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
towns um we are
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
now running five ambulances one
 
01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
paramedic intercept um um daily seven
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
seven hours uh seven days 24 hours hours
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
we've got a staff of
 
01:44:00.669 --> 01:44:00.679 align:start position:0%
52 uh EMTs amts and paramedics and we
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
currently um contract with 19 towns on
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
some level in Chester County out of the
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
23 we have a a little over a $5 million
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
budget and we've developed a Continuum
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
of Care that um has a wheelchair um
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
Department in it but we actually send
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
that out to a we we support a private
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
firm to do that this year alone they're
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to have about 13,000 runs and in
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
wheelchair Services which means our
 
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
ambulances are staying for the 911s in
 
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
the interfacility transfers we also do
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
interfacility transfers about 2,000 runs
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
this year and we are doing about n
 
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
2,911 calls um we are not utilizing
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
taxes um and we are looking at other
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
ways uh to do the revenue and we
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
understand this conversation around um
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's multiple levels that we have to
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
look at and part of that is private
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
insurance we also understand because
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
we've I've had the opportunity to have
 
01:45:02.830 --> 01:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
lunch with Senator Shaheen and talk
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
about Medicare and we're going down in
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
down to Washington in March to talk to
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation about some of
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
these concerns other concerns too but
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
those these are some on our Maps we're
 
01:45:15.629 --> 01:45:15.639 align:start position:0%
also I've had a conversation with with
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the chair about Medicaid in the
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
state and what we can do we understand
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
all of these have to work together why
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
because we're looking around the state
 
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing we're seeing struggles
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
across the board we're seeing Grafton
 
01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
County have two ambulance agencies right
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
now that are crisis of not being able to
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
continue to move forward we're talking
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
about marac New Hampshire I mean marac
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh County that has an ambulance service
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
that that actually serves three
 
01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
communities that's struggling to stay
 
01:45:43.149 --> 01:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
afloat we've seen exitor and what
 
01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
happened there I can go on and on and it
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
all comes down to the reality of of how
 
01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
do we how do we maintain this how do we
 
01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
how do we put forward a financial
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
structure that supports this this
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
network and we understand in 2026 we've
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
started to talk to towns that they're
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to have a significant impact of
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
billing from us and that they're going
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
to and and they UND and they knew that
 
01:46:07.589 --> 01:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
they knew they had that three-year ramp
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
up period and um and that in year in
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
2026 that they're going to see a
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
significant uh a significant situation
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
occur um our product is T is our care is
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
is excellent we've we've developed a we
 
01:46:26.669 --> 01:46:26.679 align:start position:0%
have great staff I'm an awe of them
 
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
every single day and I at this time what
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
I want to do is I just want to give you
 
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit uh let Cheryl talk a little
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
bit about an example of some of the
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
funding issues that we had you asked for
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
examples this is one of those and I
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
apologize I can send this example to you
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
electronically and get it out to the
 
01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
committee if if that's something you
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
would want to do after like that if you
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
willing to do that that' be great so
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
Cheryl if you could just walk us through
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
that okay so um hi good morning every
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you for allowing us to
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
speak uh we as he mentioned um have only
 
01:46:59.589 --> 01:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
been in this business for a couple years
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
and one thing that's very interesting
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
being from a County government in
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
running nursing homes and whatnot um
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to run um a a business
 
01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
when you don't know what you're
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
expecting for income and when we compare
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
the at least we do know what Medicare
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid is going to pay but the
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
insurance companies we don't always know
 
01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
what's going to pay Blue Cross Blue
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
Shield in for um example in comparison
 
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
to our charges for an ALS or a BLS run
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
um reimburses about 16% of our gross
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
charges with Medicare reimbursing
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
22% uh what we have learned um is that a
 
01:47:46.030 --> 01:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
very small percentage of our patients
 
01:47:49.709 --> 01:47:49.719 align:start position:0%
that have the coverage are encouraged
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
well they're encouraged but a small
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
percentage will actually reach back out
 
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
to the insurance company to Advocate to
 
01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
pay for the balance Bill and at times
 
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
that happens so it to us I mean they
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
will pay it but it is a a a a game or a
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
process that they have to play in order
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
to get it paid but it's a very small
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
percentage that even know or have the
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
ability to do this so in turn those
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
balances um mainly go unpaid we do have
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
a collection agency that we send them to
 
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
and um even though they do go to a
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
collection agency we really are not
 
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
getting any response it's just something
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
that the balance billing we we we would
 
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
like to get away from that having to
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
balance Bill the patients and if there
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
was um a more reasonable compensation
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why we do support um the
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 725 we feel that this is
 
01:48:50.669 --> 01:48:50.679 align:start position:0%
would be much more manageable for the
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
the patients that are receiving the care
 
01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
to then be able to afford the
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
co-insurance that exists um along with
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
what the the the contractual or
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
non-contractual amount that we'd be
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
spear thank
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
you so you mentioned that you have
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare folks that you deal with so 725
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
is not going to touch that cuz we have
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
no no and Medicaid is also something
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
different so we're not going to touch
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
that of the folks that are actually on
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
fully insured
 
01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
plans that are registered in New
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how many of them actually have
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
contracts with the with the um ambulance
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
providers you know can you you have a
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
percentage idea speak for ourself I
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
can't speak for everyone else but I know
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not actually contracted
 
01:49:54.189 --> 01:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
with any of the insurance companies
 
01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
so and it is because if you when you go
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
to negotiate for the contract prices
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're not ad the the the
 
01:50:06.589 --> 01:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
negotiation is not an adequate
 
01:50:09.629 --> 01:50:09.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so unfortunately we're
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
left with accepting the amount that
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
they'll pay now and then in turn the
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
balance goes to the insured so typically
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
you don't have contracts okay thank you
 
01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:25.109 align:start position:0%
you don't have contracts okay thank you
representative

01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
wals thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:29.639 align:start position:0%
for testifying I was wondering if you
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
could just clarify something sir um you
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
had said at the beginning that you your
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
2911 calls and that you don't utilize
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
taxes and then later you said you're
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
going to build
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
towns so I just needed to understand is
 
01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
that because when you first started
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
because you're only did have done this
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
for two years or contra should be these
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
are contractually contractual towns that
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
we have contracts with that's why they
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a service we're supplying
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
that service right I understand that but
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
you had said you don't utilize taxes but
 
01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:06.679 align:start position:0%
that when you Bill a town that's it's
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
coming from the people's taxes right not
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
using County taxes we're not using
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
County taxes okay thank you that's what
 
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:14.830 align:start position:0%
County taxes okay thank you that's what
I

01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
want however as a startup model we are
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
running a deficit that is a liability
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
due back to our general fund um so we
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
are not outright billing through our
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
taxes and it's not our intention we are
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
it is go it is our goal to pay back that
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
liability to the general fund there are
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
some people on the finance committee who
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
will ensure that the there will be no
 
01:51:43.069 --> 01:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
deficit to the county that at the end of
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
the day whatever de deficit it is
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
created is going to have to be build by
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
the towns that are participating and we
 
01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
believe we have a model so you know we
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
but we're a startup an emergency
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
startup really so and and and and the
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
bottom line the bottom line for us is
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
what we're finding is that you know
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
again if if we have a a BLS emergency
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
base rate of
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
$1,800 and we have and this is a situ
 
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
this is a true situation occurred we
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
have mileage that adds on another 177
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
that's a 1,977
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
that we're billing out right and through
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
$326 and what was interesting in this is
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
this is one of those situations where
 
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
the individual that went on the got got
 
01:52:39.069 --> 01:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
the notice that they were on the hook
 
01:52:39.079 --> 01:52:41.470 align:start position:0%
the notice that they were on the hook
for

01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
$1650 and they called and they pushed
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
back and they pushed back and guess what
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
we got a second Bill a payment a payment
 
01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
$1,509 and they asked us that the
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
insurer asked us to pay back the 30 uh
 
01:53:08.589 --> 01:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
$326 so in reality when it all comes
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
down to it we're at we're at a Tipping
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
Point right we're at a crisis and I'm
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
seeing it all over the place I'm seeing
 
01:53:16.109 --> 01:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
it in in our own communities where where
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
towns are you know are trying sh trying
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
to pay their bills to pay their people
 
01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.589 align:start position:0%
to pay their bills to pay their people
and

01:53:22.589 --> 01:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
this game doesn't help us if they had
 
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
just paid the 1600 not not the 1900 that
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
it cost but the 1600 we wouldn't be here
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
today we would be in a better situation
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
and we can show you the the breakdown of
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
all that representative spear thank
 
01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
you when you were talking about the
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
numbers you said uh I I and you'll have
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
to forgive me if I don't get it right
 
01:53:46.589 --> 01:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
that you were getting um some percentage
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
from Medicare and I think you said 23%
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
22 22% okay 22% and Arisa plans was
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
another some low that's a breakout of
 
01:54:00.189 --> 01:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
the of the clientele not not the oh no
 
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
no this this was this is actually uh in
 
01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
response to that that same claim we
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
would have received a reimbursement of
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
22% from Medicare but the patient would
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
have been responsible for their co-
 
01:54:16.589 --> 01:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
insurance and it the co- Insurance
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
obviously is more reasonable under that
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
so you typically get the collection of
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
the co- insurance when someone is under
 
01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare no doubt obviously Medicare
 
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
pays a lot less than what this bill
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
would recommend but um but
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
what the same claim we're getting 16%
 
01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by the um the Blue Cross
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
insurance and the entire balance because
 
01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
that's what balance billing does it the
 
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
co there's no Co insurances anymore the
 
01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
balance billing basically gives but you
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
have no contract with the insurance
 
01:54:56.830 --> 01:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
companies typically and with Medicare
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
back I don't see how you can survive
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
this way well that's that's one of the
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
reasons why we're having the
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
conversations with our federal
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
delegation that's why but the problem
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm having I think and and and this is
 
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
the problem I've had since last year on
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is the notion that 20% of the
 
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
population is going to pay for the 80% s
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
that we can't touch and can't do
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
anything about and I'm having I I can't
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
get past that particular problem the
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
fact that in order for you to stay
 
01:55:36.669 --> 01:55:36.679 align:start position:0%
alive you can't live with 26 23%
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement all the time that's crazy
 
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
you're never going to make it so so if
 
01:55:43.709 --> 01:55:43.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to be if we're going to
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
be upping the rate for the 20% of people
 
01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
that are fully insured in New
 
01:55:52.589 --> 01:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is only as I said only
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
about 20% of the
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
population unless we overcharge unless
 
01:56:01.709 --> 01:56:01.719 align:start position:0%
we overspend in that small group you it
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to add up that you can make
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
it would you believe which is exactly
 
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
why I think fine would you
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
believe which is exactly why we need to
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
advocate for the federal government to
 
01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
pay more so that in turn yes these what
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
is being presented really we can't wait
 
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
till the
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
Teresa so uh pardon my ignorance on the
 
01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
billing uh aspect of the ambulance
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
services but my question is that do we
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
have uh some agency or regulatory body
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
or something my question is that is the
 
01:56:44.589 --> 01:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
services listed under ambul Services it
 
01:56:48.589 --> 01:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
is same from agency to agency that means
 
01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:50.679 align:start position:0%
every agency in New Hampshire do they
 
01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:53.800 align:start position:0%
cost the same amount of money for the
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
same service do you have anything like
 
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
that or or you set to your you can set
 
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
your own prices we all set our own
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
prices and I think everyone has a
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
different cost for doing business but um
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
that is some of what was presented um to
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
this committee or some of the research
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
is presenting the information to help
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
quantify our the other bill was all
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
those numbers were submitted to the
 
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
department representative Gibbs thank
 
01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:23.030 align:start position:0%
department representative Gibbs thank
you

01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
um does it seem reasonably likely that
 
01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass and so you
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
would receive for that proportion of um
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
the insurance plans that are covered by
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
this bill uh recognizing that a lot of
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
them that we just can't touch but for
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
those that are covered by this bill you
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
would receive three 325 per of the
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
Medicare rate does that seem reasonably
 
01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
likely to allow you to operate without
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
consistently running a
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
deficit I I think that it's it's our our
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
belief that it's a piece of the puzzle
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
to get to that point where we need to be
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
we the towns need to understand that are
 
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
contractually obligated to us that
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a cost to it you
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
know we've got to work with our federal
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
delegation we got to work with the state
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
you know State reps to to see if we can
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
do something about the Medicaid levels
 
01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
in the state all those things need to
 
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
all occur and then there's there's other
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
things that we need to take a look at
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's
 
01:58:21.679 --> 01:58:22.629 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's
significant

01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
us this this legislation is not about
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
solving the funding
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
problem okay at the end of the
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
day whoever
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
municipality the ambulance that's in
 
01:58:38.109 --> 01:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
that is going to get built okay and I
 
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
would urge all of you since we're doing
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
property T you know we're doing your
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
know Town meetings right now is go look
 
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
and see how much your town pays for the
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
ambulance service and that is a line
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
item in every every single Town's budget
 
01:58:58.589 --> 01:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much Mr chairman oh
 
01:59:01.069 --> 01:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry represent M has a question uh
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you yes just a real quick question
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
um if medic care pays you what the 22%
 
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
or 177% if somebody has a supplemental
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
plan doesn't that plan kick in and give
 
01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
extra money if if that supplemental plan
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
covers the co- Insurance yes so it
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's where why typic Al payment or
 
01:59:26.430 --> 01:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
Billings to MediCare at least I think
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
what we are experiencing you tend to end
 
01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:30.069 align:start position:0%
what we are experiencing you tend to end
up

01:59:30.069 --> 01:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
getting paid for the charge it's one um
 
01:59:36.189 --> 01:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
because either there is a supplemental
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
plan or the co- insurance is more
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the patient to pay thank
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
you okay great oh R am has a I can't
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
hold it I'm sorry thank you Mr chair
 
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for for your testimony you
 
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there's cases where a a
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
patient gets their balance bill they get
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
their bill they submit it to their
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
insurance company and they end up
 
02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
getting reimbursed with it I'm just
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
wondering could you put a notice on the
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
bill that you send out instructing the
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
person receiving it that they can do
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
that so that more people do it so we
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
actually have a third a sec a third
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
party billing company we don't do it
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
right out of our office but when
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
patients end up calling
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
because they want to not acknowledge the
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill and again I think sometimes the
 
02:00:31.629 --> 02:00:31.639 align:start position:0%
bill scares people away so they just
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
ignore it but those that do call to say
 
02:00:38.589 --> 02:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
hey wow that's when our billing agency
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
does um um Advocate that they Advocate
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
on their own to reach out to the
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
insurance company to pay the balance and
 
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
right now when we we've taken a look at
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
that it's about a quarter of the those
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
that are receiving it that are that are
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
actually trying to take advantage of of
 
02:00:58.750 --> 02:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
of pushing back and appealing but our
 
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and with our receivables you know
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
looking at those outstanding
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
balances the the the the percentage of
 
02:01:10.950 --> 02:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
the claim that is due from the insurance
 
02:01:14.109 --> 02:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
is about 35% when it comes to Blue Cross
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
Blue Shield with the the 64 65% being
 
02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the patient and
 
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
that's the highest swing
 
02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
of the um the percentages that are due
 
02:01:29.790 --> 02:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
from insurance versus due from
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
patient thank you very
 
02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.189 --> 02:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
Chris Mr chairman I promise I will be
 
02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
exceedingly quick so as not to try the
 
02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
patience of the chair that's why I saved
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
you for last thank you I you know I
 
02:01:51.189 --> 02:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
really just wanted to testify because
 
02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not anth
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
um just just a just a couple of quick
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
points because I want to tell everybody
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
who you are with that is a salute Point
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
Chris Kennedy vice president of external
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
relations for centin and am better
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
health plans uh some of you may know us
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
as a Managed Care Organization that
 
02:02:07.629 --> 02:02:07.639 align:start position:0%
works with the Department of Health and
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
Human Services to administer State
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid benefits but we also have uh
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
commercial plans uh uh exclusively on
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
Exchange and the individual Market with
 
02:02:20.350 --> 02:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 25,000 policy holders so
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
we're not a a big carrier in in the
 
02:02:25.390 --> 02:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
market and all of our members are
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
individual uh policy holders it's a very
 
02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
price sensitive market so the cost
 
02:02:34.109 --> 02:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
ramifications of 325 per uh escalation
 
02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
in the rate floor really in the rate uh
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
could be very consequential to them I
 
02:02:40.709 --> 02:02:40.719 align:start position:0%
will just also state that about 50% of
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
our members already receive a federal
 
02:02:45.629 --> 02:02:45.639 align:start position:0%
subsidy towards their premium so these
 
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
are individuals who are are are very
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
tenuous in terms of being able to afford
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
their coverage so 325 5% uh of Medicare
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
would represent an an exponential
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
increase that could absolutely represent
 
02:02:59.709 --> 02:02:59.719 align:start position:0%
a barrier to access to coverage uh for
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
our membership and and frankly not just
 
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
ours but the other uh members on the
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
individual Market including Harvard
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim and uh Anthem both have plans on
 
02:03:09.310 --> 02:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
the individual market so yes I think the
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
325 per is a challenge I also think 325
 
02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
per without the Stick of requiring the
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
providers to be in our network is
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
problematic you're setting a floor for
 
02:03:22.109 --> 02:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
the negotiating standpoint but you're
 
02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
not requiring them to be in our Network
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
and that deprives our members of the
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
benefits of credentialing and quality
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
standards that we hold Network providers
 
02:03:32.669 --> 02:03:32.679 align:start position:0%
too we think that's pretty important but
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
the last thing I will say and I'm going
 
02:03:37.390 --> 02:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
to be really quick uh Mr chair is I am
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to make a plug for 316 because I
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
happen to serve on the New Hampshire
 
02:03:43.229 --> 02:03:43.239 align:start position:0%
Health Plan board which is the Quasi uh
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
governmental entity attached to the
 
02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department that uh procured
 
02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
the consultant and and um uh I've been
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
if you haven't read the report from PCG
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to do so it's about 45
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
pages it's riveting stuff but but you
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
know it's it's actually really
 
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
insightful because it is a real-time
 
02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
market analysis with cost impact of the
 
02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
kind of rate increases that they they
 
02:04:10.030 --> 02:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
prop and yes they they propose in that
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
report a rate increase with some
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
authority to the department to to
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
periodically review and even increase
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
that rate further uh contingent on
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
real-time market dynamics so you know I
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
think that that in fact Mr chairman if
 
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm not mistaken that um report
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
was carried out at the directive
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
essentially of this commit an amendment
 
02:04:33.149 --> 02:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
that derived from this committee with
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
resources allocated from the state I
 
02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
think it would be a shame to waste all
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
of that work uh it was a fairly
 
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
intensive and exhaustive Report it's
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
really thorough and thoughtful and
 
02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:43.719 align:start position:0%
frankly I think it's the way we want to
 
02:04:46.109 --> 02:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
do public policy uh understand the cost
 
02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
impacts and market dynamics and then
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
make our decision right rather than
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
hoping for the best so with that Mr
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I will thank you very much Mr
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
Kennedy okay as it often happens I say I
 
02:05:01.390 --> 02:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
have no more cards and then one appears
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
nowhere and since he is a co-sponsor and
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
was holding on to his card because he
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to answer all the questions and
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
all the problems you had to know it's
 
02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
coming but let's not go five minutes
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
let's go three minutes
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
because we have another one of your
 
02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:21.910 align:start position:0%
because we have another one of your
cohorts

02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
cohorts
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
for the record Mark PR Hillsboro 15
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 8 yeah I signed on as a
 
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor but didn't turn out the way I
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
really wanted it to go 325
 
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
per. no it will not keep us in in the
 
02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
black we can't survive on
 
02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
325 yes we do Bill we bill for HazMat
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
incidents and I was just in a committee
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
putting in $1,000 a day fine to the
 
02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
insurance company when they don't pay
 
02:05:56.350 --> 02:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
after 90 days shocking the insurance
 
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.109 --> 02:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
um so on balance billing recovery I
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
think it depends a lot on your billing
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
company uh I actually work uh for eping
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
fire department we run three ambulances
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
we have a very good billing company that
 
02:06:23.629 --> 02:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
recovers uh um money from the insurance
 
02:06:25.709 --> 02:06:25.719 align:start position:0%
company but also does a good job at
 
02:06:25.719 --> 02:06:27.310 align:start position:0%
company but also does a good job at
balance

02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
balance
 
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
billing um clean claims I mean they look
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
for any excuse I was talking to another
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
Ins Insurance company that Healthy
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
Families rejected like 12 of their
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
claims for small clerical errors and
 
02:06:45.069 --> 02:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let them resubmit so on and on
 
02:06:45.079 --> 02:06:45.830 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let them resubmit so on and on
we

02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:48.709 align:start position:0%
we
go

02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
um you know and I I heard them say well
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
we hate coming here arguing all the
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
time well if you stop stealing money
 
02:06:59.549 --> 02:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
from us when we send you the bill if you
 
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
paid it we wouldn't be here but still
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
you keep stealing money from the
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and and everybody else because
 
02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
you don't pay your bills I I I still
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
have trouble wrapping my head around
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
that how when you Bill somebody they
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
don't pay I go to jail if I do
 
02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
that but they don't um
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
and Anthem being reasonable in
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
negotiations and I I just heard the last
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
gentleman if you're going to raise it to
 
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
325 we want to get you they need to be
 
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
in network so you can reduce the rate of
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
the in network rate below the
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
325 I'm guessing but we need to make it
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
so these companies can continue you
 
02:07:48.189 --> 02:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
heard all these other speakers how
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
they're on the edge right I know uh my
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
department we're
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
billing the taxpayers to supplement the
 
02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:59.149 align:start position:0%
billing the taxpayers to supplement the
service

02:07:59.149 --> 02:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
because it's we're not bringing enough
 
02:08:05.069 --> 02:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
in and what are people going to do when
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
especially the rural ambulances go out
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
of out of business somebody's going to
 
02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
have to come in and cover them and
 
02:08:14.109 --> 02:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a longer response
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
time longer response times in critical
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
cases equal death no way around that
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
so that's what you're looking at and I'm
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to be brief this time and I hope
 
02:08:30.189 --> 02:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
to see you in the
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%

02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
direction a baby step any step a baby
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%

that that went longer than I expected I
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
thought I thought I was doing so well in
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the hearing that because it was
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately yeah there aren't there
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
aren't too many people here right you
 
02:10:23.390 --> 02:10:23.400 align:start position:0%

02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the record Representative Steve
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District 13 which
 
02:10:40.589 --> 02:10:40.599 align:start position:0%
encompasses the town of dairy now why on

Earth do you have this piece of
 
02:10:44.589 --> 02:10:44.599 align:start position:0%
legislation before you let me tell you a
 
02:10:44.599 --> 02:10:45.750 align:start position:0%
legislation before you let me tell you a
story

02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
story
 
02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:47.629 align:start position:0%
story
right

02:10:47.629 --> 02:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
so a constituent of mine
 
02:10:54.910 --> 02:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh traversing down the road broadsided a
 
02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
car backing out of their
 
02:11:00.510 --> 02:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
driveway This was
 
02:11:07.229 --> 02:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
um very clear fault here on this
 
02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
okay what do you do this person this
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine never been in a car
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
do the vehicle gets towed to a sh
 
02:11:25.149 --> 02:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
the insurance company comes down and
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
says you know here you go get a rental
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
car you got to be able to you got to be
 
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:33.400 align:start position:0%

02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
world and that insurance company the the
 
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
insurance company of the offending
 
02:11:41.470 --> 02:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
party uh looked at the car said we're
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
going to Total
 
02:11:45.549 --> 02:11:45.559 align:start position:0%
it that happens all the
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
time but here's where things went very
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
wrong very fast
 
02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
and this is on the shoulders of Liberty
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
Mutual because they're the ones that did
 
02:11:57.159 --> 02:11:59.589 align:start position:0%
Mutual because they're the ones that did
it

02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
but and I'll also before I explain where
 
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
this went wrong I firsthand witnessed
 
02:12:07.390 --> 02:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
this I was with the constituent their
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
phone was on speaker for part of this
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
and I heard this with my own two
 
02:12:15.790 --> 02:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
ears as soon as they total it the threat
 
02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
the threatening
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
started oh you've got to turn that
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
rental car in right now
 
02:12:25.229 --> 02:12:25.239 align:start position:0%

on this total right now because for
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
every day you wait we're going to charge
 
02:12:33.629 --> 02:12:33.639 align:start position:0%

02:12:34.750 --> 02:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
totaled okay wow so there's a little
 
02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
pressure there into forcing someone into
 
02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:41.229 align:start position:0%
pressure there into forcing someone into
an

02:12:41.229 --> 02:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
agreement on something they really know
 
02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:45.430 align:start position:0%
agreement on something they really know
nothing

02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:12:47.549 --> 02:12:47.559 align:start position:0%
about but that rental car has got to
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
come back now because we just totaled
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
your vehicle so you've got to turn that
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
in now or you have to pay starting
 
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I heard that with my own two
 
02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
ears shocked at what I was hearing that
 
02:13:01.870 --> 02:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
a person not at fault in an accident
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
would be treated in such a manner and
 
02:13:06.669 --> 02:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
forced to do things under threat of them
 
02:13:08.350 --> 02:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
now having to pay out a pocket for
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
something that they didn't
 
02:13:10.239 --> 02:13:12.069 align:start position:0%
something that they didn't
cause

02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
cause
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
so that is the precipice of this okay
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
when you own a single car and your car's
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
just been destroyed
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
it how do you do that when you're
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
already freaked out thank God this
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
person was not
 
02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
injured you don't know what to do you've
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
never experienced this before you've got
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
an insurance carrier threatening you
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
left and right that you're going to have
 
02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
to pay for all these things and now
 
02:13:46.549 --> 02:13:46.559 align:start position:0%
you've got to come up with a way to buy
 
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
a car
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
now so I think there needs to be a
 
02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:54.390 align:start position:0%
now so I think there needs to be a
period

02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:13:57.549 --> 02:13:57.559 align:start position:0%
here where folks can catch their
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
breath and figure out what's going on
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
and how the hell do I get another car if
 
02:14:09.149 --> 02:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.229 --> 02:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
car that's where this came from
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to pick on Liberty Mutual
 
02:14:16.990 --> 02:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that were on
 
02:14:19.149 --> 02:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
the on the other line that may not
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
represent the tactics of other insurance
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
companies I would hope it doesn't
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
represent the tactics of any insurance
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why I sat down and tried to
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
figure out what we can do here to
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
prevent a predatory practice on our
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
citizens that are at a massive
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
disadvantage so asking for seven days to
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.109 --> 02:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
unreasonable the fact that they even
 
02:15:00.030 --> 02:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
processed this entire claim out to
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
determine a totaling of a vehicle and
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
determining that all of the parameters
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
they did in under a week little
 
02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
impressive actually that they're on
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
their game that that
 
02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:12.750 align:start position:0%
their game that that
tight

02:15:12.750 --> 02:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
tight
 
02:15:17.069 --> 02:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
but there has to be some reasonable
 
02:15:17.079 --> 02:15:18.950 align:start position:0%
but there has to be some reasonable
thought

02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
thought
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
here with these with these f folks and I
 
02:15:25.390 --> 02:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
think asking for them to to provide
 
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
seven days of a rental car for someone
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
to Simply Be able to try to put their
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
life back
 
02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
together is is not a tall tail you it's
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
not a tall ask rather it's not a it's
 
02:15:40.549 --> 02:15:40.559 align:start position:0%
not a an a significant burden
 
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
so that's uh that's the deal with this
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's where it came from and I'm happy
 
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
to take any questions you
 
02:15:52.030 --> 02:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
want okay make sure I understand
 
02:15:55.229 --> 02:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
was Liberty Mutual the policy holder is
 
02:15:56.910 --> 02:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
see the the person who was in the
 
02:15:58.830 --> 02:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
accident they were the policy holder of
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
the vehicle that caused the accident
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay so this is the other correct not it
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
was not the insurance company of the so
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
it had nothing to do with uninsured
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
because both both parties were both
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
parties were absolutely insured insured
 
02:16:16.030 --> 02:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
spear thank
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
you the policy that I have for my call
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
car has a line item that says in it in
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
the event of an accident and the car is
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
destroyed in any way manner or form
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of what
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
happens I get a rental car and I pay for
 
02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
that and it's something like $2 a year
 
02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
or some such Crazy Little Thing like
 
02:16:35.639 --> 02:16:37.070 align:start position:0%
or some such Crazy Little Thing like
that

02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:40.830 --> 02:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
MH we already have I mean that's that's
 
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
you choose your insurance company buy I
 
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
mean you could say well that guy doesn't
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
offer it but this guy does so I'll go
 
02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
with this guy are we legislating because
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't understand the
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
insurance Market or and I and I have an
 
02:17:00.030 --> 02:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
example that's even more bizarre than
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
yours my car was eaten by
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
mice not not bizarre okay it is but that
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
that's so so let me let me focus on what
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
you actually asked me the first part so
 
02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:13.389 align:start position:0%
you actually asked me the first part so
so

02:17:13.389 --> 02:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
again if you take out a policy and you
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't cover yourself for a rental car
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
because you screwed up right you you
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
caused an accident in some manner that's
 
02:17:27.309 --> 02:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
on you but this spe this piece of
 
02:17:31.230 --> 02:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
legislation states that when you are not
 
02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:33.150 align:start position:0%
legislation states that when you are not
at

02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
fault you're going to get the coverage
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
from the other company for seven
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
days for to no fault of your own here
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
obviously we're going to get into the
 
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty of the
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
situation we'll have a subcommittee and
 
02:17:50.910 --> 02:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
figure this one out yes okay
 
02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:54.519 align:start position:0%
representative M uh thank you uh just wh
 
02:17:56.509 --> 02:17:56.519 align:start position:0%
why didn't this person go to their own
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
insurance company did they have uh car
 
02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
rental uh Insurance on their own policy
 
02:18:04.110 --> 02:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
they did
 
02:18:07.309 --> 02:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
not they had a choice representative
 
02:18:10.110 --> 02:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
sha uh hold on a second hold on a second
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
they had a choice but they also had a
 
02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
choice not to get in to beat an accident
 
02:18:16.750 --> 02:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
that was not their fault as well no they
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
didn't they didn't make the mistake they
 
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
didn't initiate the ACT here that's
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's the difference with this this
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
isn't a blanket coverage concept here
 
02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the per with the at
 
02:18:31.469 --> 02:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
fault carrier
 
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
not not both of
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
them got it repres sh okay so are you
 
02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
are you saying that uh if the car is
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
damaged and goes to the shop then
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
typically insurance company pays for 15
 
02:18:48.509 --> 02:18:48.519 align:start position:0%
days or 30 days depending on the policy
 
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh if the car goes to shop but if the
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
car total the insurance company do not
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
pay it is that a standard in insurance
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
companies so he saying I can't answer to
 
02:19:00.669 --> 02:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
the to standardization or the specifics
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
of that but if this car had to have been
 
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
repaired instead of just totaled he
 
02:19:06.309 --> 02:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
would have had a rental car for the
 
02:19:08.429 --> 02:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
entire duration of the time it took to
 
02:19:10.349 --> 02:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
have the car repaired I'm aware of that
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
but are you saying that in in of total
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
they don't give
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
it they don't cover it if it's totaled
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
at all apparently they don't okay thank
 
02:19:20.559 --> 02:19:22.669 align:start position:0%
at all apparently they don't okay thank
you

02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%

a claim to reach out to the insurance
 
02:20:29.110 --> 02:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
department we have a consumer division
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%

difficulties with a um a claim as was
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
just mentioned um just described I would
 
02:20:42.030 --> 02:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
encourage um anyone going through that
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
to reach out to us to our consumer
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
affairs uh to our consumer services
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
division and file a complaint or um an
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry um because we will look look at
 
02:20:54.190 --> 02:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
matters um like such as that
 
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
um um where where there seems to be an
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
issue in the processing of the claim um
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
getting into this bill um as I
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
understand this bill um it seeks to add
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory rental um coverage in
 
02:21:10.990 --> 02:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
instances where there's been um an atall
 
02:21:14.750 --> 02:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
accident um I would
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
um note that we don't have a lot of
 
02:21:18.990 --> 02:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory coverages in auto insurance
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
currently so this would be
 
02:21:23.389 --> 02:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
um somewhat different than we currently
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
have and and on top of that um I would
 
02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
also mention that currently in our
 
02:21:32.349 --> 02:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
administrative rules there's a claim
 
02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
settlement Rule Insurance rule ins
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
1000 part of the rule that pertains to
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
to PNC Insurance to Property and
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
Casualty Insurance is 10002 and within
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
that rule in 10215 there's a provision
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
regarding total loss rental coverage
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
already um the department is currently
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
reviewing that rule as the rule is set
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
to expire so we're we're currently
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
reviewing that rule it'll be go for
 
02:21:58.270 --> 02:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing um but the that rule
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
currently um requires that in instances
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
where a claimant is making a claim um
 
02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
for total loss that at least 5 days of
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
um rental coverage be
 
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
provided um to the claimant after an
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
equitable settlement offer has been made
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with the unfair Insurance
 
02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
trade practice law um so to that extent
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
um this law uh isn't necessary we are
 
02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:25.910 align:start position:0%
um this law uh isn't necessary we are
currently

02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:22:29.349 --> 02:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
reviewing that rule as it is up um as it
 
02:22:31.630 --> 02:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
is um set to expire so we're pro
 
02:22:32.830 --> 02:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
currently in the process of reviewing
 
02:22:34.429 --> 02:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
that there'll be hearings on that I
 
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
would also mention that in um just
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
generally even though that isn't
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
directly the issue here that there's
 
02:22:42.630 --> 02:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
also a rule in that in that
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
um in that set of rules
 
02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
10213 um that pertains to frontal
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
coverage for claimants where there's
 
02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:50.990 align:start position:0%
coverage for claimants where there's
been

02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:22:53.309 --> 02:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
um where the cars needs to be repaired
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
and the um claimant has made a a claim
 
02:22:58.510 --> 02:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
against the atal party under that um the
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
party um the claim and is um provided
 
02:23:03.389 --> 02:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
rental for like kind and quality vehicle
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
for the duration of the repair um you
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
know as long as the um the only if the
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
if there's no delay by the claimant and
 
02:23:13.150 --> 02:23:13.160 align:start position:0%
the claimant is entitled to repair
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
during the repair process um so there is
 
02:23:18.269 --> 02:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
rental um issues already addressed in
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules um for the
 
02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
insurance department um and and also
 
02:23:25.870 --> 02:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
going back to the 10215 total loss rule
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
that also does address the issue for
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
insurers who have rental coverage and
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
says they have to be at least provided
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
the amount of u coverage they have under
 
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
their policy I um we have some just some
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
general concerns about this bill um you
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
know the the seven days um May May in
 
02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
some instances not be enough to settle a
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
claim sometimes claims take longer so it
 
02:23:50.830 --> 02:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
could inadvertently provide less Le
 
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
rental coverage than is needed um and
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
then also the bill says that the rental
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
must be from a regional or national
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
carrier um we just note that sometimes
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
um consumers rent vehicles from other
 
02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
sources such as the repair shop or you
 
02:24:08.910 --> 02:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
know there's other options now in the
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
the the out there in the Commerce and
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
then also some of the phraseology total
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
coverage just I think that would need
 
02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
Clarity we're not quite sure what that
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
would mean um
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
just as again typically under the law
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
currently um claimants receive vehicles
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
of like kind of quality from what they
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
have and typically for insureds you know
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's Provisions also um maybe
 
02:24:34.030 --> 02:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount that the insured allow
 
02:24:35.389 --> 02:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
per day under the rental coverage under
 
02:24:37.630 --> 02:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
their policy so there's just some things
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
that would need to be looked at for that
 
02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
um and then typically also if for
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
insured who have insurance uh coverage
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
for rental coverage under their policy
 
02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
and that typically is provided
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of fault it's just whether
 
02:24:51.309 --> 02:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
they have Gage for it or not whether
 
02:24:54.910 --> 02:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
they purchased it um so and then lastly
 
02:24:56.910 --> 02:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
I would just say that to the extent that
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
this is put into a statute that you know
 
02:25:01.309 --> 02:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
potentially looking to put it in one of
 
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
the um statutes that already pertains to
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
Property and Casualty RSA 412 may be a
 
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
better place to put it as opposed into
 
02:25:09.910 --> 02:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
the these right now this is being
 
02:25:10.990 --> 02:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
proposed to put into the department of
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
safety use
 
02:25:16.429 --> 02:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
rules um and we are happy to work with
 
02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor and to um look at this
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
issue further as I as I said we are
 
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
currently looking at the um claim
 
02:25:25.790 --> 02:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
settlement rule that pertains to rental
 
02:25:27.309 --> 02:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
coverage we're looking at the whole rule
 
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
as the rule um is set to expire so we're
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
in the process of looking at all the
 
02:25:34.469 --> 02:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
rules in in 10002 and we're happy to uh
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
work with the sponsor to discuss these
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
issues not that I know a lot about auto
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
insurance because I haven't gotten too
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
many accidents um but my experience many
 
02:25:49.469 --> 02:25:49.479 align:start position:0%
many years ago I had an accident in
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
which it was 50 50 you know the you know
 
02:25:55.070 --> 02:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
who theault
 
02:25:59.790 --> 02:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
50/50 but other than that if if I have
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
if we're in an accident and it's clearly
 
02:26:03.309 --> 02:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
the other guy's fault you know the other
 
02:26:06.990 --> 02:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
guy pulled out and hit the
 
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
car why would I be talking to the other
 
02:26:13.950 --> 02:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
person's insurance company at all I
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
should be talking to my insurance
 
02:26:18.429 --> 02:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
company and my insurance company should
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
be the one that's negotiating
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
this this total issue in other words
 
02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
isn't it my insurance company will
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
decide whether they agree the total that
 
02:26:30.349 --> 02:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
it's that should be total or I mean it
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
and and if I understand the situation
 
02:26:35.469 --> 02:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
correctly we're looking at the other
 
02:26:35.479 --> 02:26:37.269 align:start position:0%
correctly we're looking at the other
parties

02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
parties
 
02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh appr appraiser
 
02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
telling someone else insurance that this
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
is what you're got to do and I'm going
 
02:26:49.630 --> 02:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
no no my my insurance is with my
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
insurance company company and it's isn't
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
it their job to negotiate the the
 
02:26:56.349 --> 02:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
settlement with this other car with the
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
car and whe if it's total and isn't it
 
02:27:01.269 --> 02:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
their obligation to you know to you know
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
say okay by the way you know you're
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to provide you I
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
mean a rental car you or whatever I mean
 
02:27:10.670 --> 02:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
I I guess if it a cars once it's been
 
02:27:13.469 --> 02:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
totaled but my mind these decisions are
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
not made that quickly when it's two
 
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
different insurance companies involved
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
am I misunderstanding the situation
 
02:27:23.269 --> 02:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
I mean it it it can it the amount of
 
02:27:24.870 --> 02:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
time it takes to determine whether the
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
car needs to be total can vary there's a
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
lot of factors that can come into play
 
02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes I mean it you know depends on
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
the severity of the accident the age of
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
the vehicle what was damaged and in
 
02:27:36.670 --> 02:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
terms of the processing of the claim
 
02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
some people choose if they have you know
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
choose to go through their own carrier
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
if they have um property damage coverage
 
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
under their policy but some people even
 
02:27:49.389 --> 02:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
if they have that coverage may choose to
 
02:27:51.630 --> 02:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
um try to go through the other person's
 
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
um insurance company it really is a
 
02:27:55.710 --> 02:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
personal decision to some extent but
 
02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
there is you know often as you're
 
02:28:00.349 --> 02:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
mentioning back and forth uh between the
 
02:28:03.790 --> 02:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
carriers as the as the as the carriers
 
02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
investigate who was at fault for the
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
accident who's who's responsible for the
 
02:28:11.309 --> 02:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
accident um so there is there is um
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes back and forth um I don't know
 
02:28:16.750 --> 02:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
if that answers your question well
 
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
learned more about it representative
 
02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:21.190 align:start position:0%
learned more about it representative
speaker

02:28:21.190 --> 02:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned before that you know if
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
somebody runs into a problem with
 
02:28:26.349 --> 02:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
insurance that they should contact the
 
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
insurance department yes have you seen
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
cases where an insurance
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
company as their initial tactic will say
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
no I'm not going to do that I'm not
 
02:28:39.870 --> 02:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
going to cover you for whatever reason
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then maybe after you guys after you
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
folks get involved in it they have to do
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
what they have to do well um have you
 
02:28:49.870 --> 02:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
seen cases like that I'm sorry um the we
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
we we have as I mentioned we have the
 
02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
consumer services um division that
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
handles um consumer complaints and those
 
02:29:01.269 --> 02:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
come in for a variety of reasons that um
 
02:29:04.030 --> 02:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
you know consumers have questions or
 
02:29:05.830 --> 02:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
they have have a concern about the way
 
02:29:07.469 --> 02:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
that their claim is processed so it
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
could be for variety of reasons um but
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
the insurance department um looks at
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
those complaints to see whether there's
 
02:29:16.150 --> 02:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
been um whether the insurance company
 
02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
has acted in compliance with the
 
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory laws that govern the
 
02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
insurance companies um so we we look at
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
it from that it can be there can be a
 
02:29:27.870 --> 02:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
number of reasons why consur consumers
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
claims thank you very much I have one
 
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
mlin representing All State I guess
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
opposition morning Mr chairman and
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
02:29:54.309 --> 02:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mike mlof I'm a
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer and lobbyist in conquer
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
representing All State Insurance and
 
02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
unlike the chairman I do have great
 
02:30:01.830 --> 02:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
experience in wrecking cars and making
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
claims I I think what we've seen this
 
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
morning is a conflation of uh two issues
 
02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
one is the ATA party own insurance and
 
02:30:15.630 --> 02:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
the other's the uh you hit somebody who
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
is uh uh completely at fault and then
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
you de to go your Insurance to go to
 
02:30:22.429 --> 02:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
their insurance so if you have you know
 
02:30:24.030 --> 02:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Collision liability in
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
that type of situation many people just
 
02:30:28.349 --> 02:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
go to their own insurance and suffer the
 
02:30:31.070 --> 02:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
$500 deductible which they'll get back
 
02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:31.910 align:start position:0%
$500 deductible which they'll get back
on

02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
subreg uh when you look at an automobile
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
accident you have damages and damages
 
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
include loss of property uh physical
 
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
injury and loss of use of the car so
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at that third party
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company whether it be mutual
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
um whatever it's Liberty Mutual
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
XYZ uh you have a claim for all of your
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
damages including loss of use of that
 
02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle the fact that Liberty Mutual as
 
02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
the uh ATA party would not pay for you
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
know the automatic rental for that
 
02:31:03.710 --> 02:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
person who was hit Is Not Unusual
 
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
because there's so many things that have
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
to be sorted out before they accept
 
02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility but if you're uninsured
 
02:31:12.429 --> 02:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
uh again you still have the same claim
 
02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
against that third party again the
 
02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
system is not lightning fast but you're
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
not going to get an automatic payment
 
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
from a third party insurance company um
 
02:31:25.230 --> 02:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
just because you asked them uh if you
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
look at the bill there's also I think
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
some drafting issues
 
02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
um was not at fault I mean we have a
 
02:31:34.830 --> 02:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
comparative negligence states so the
 
02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
determination of at fault is something
 
02:31:39.309 --> 02:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
that really is not automatic I mean the
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
police report may put it in but the
 
02:31:42.590 --> 02:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
accent of ah had they hesitate to try to
 
02:31:46.510 --> 02:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
make conclusion uh or police or reported
 
02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
by the decision of an insurance company
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know what a reported decision is
 
02:31:52.590 --> 02:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
I've never seen a insurance company
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
report the decisions to anybody and most
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
of them will simply um uh the facts will
 
02:32:00.910 --> 02:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
stand and you'll either go to court or
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
not but again the mixing of the two
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
issues the third party who hits you if
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have insurance you do have
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
your damages claimed and it may take
 
02:32:10.910 --> 02:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
some time to get it but they're not
 
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
going to just uh turn around and give
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
you benefits until this is all sorted
 
02:32:17.469 --> 02:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
out but again the um if you don't have
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
if you have your own insurance policy uh
 
02:32:22.269 --> 02:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
you your company will collect on that
 
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
rental that you have under segregation
 
02:32:26.429 --> 02:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
uh your damage is included again
 
02:32:29.469 --> 02:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
property uh physical all those different
 
02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
things and it this the bill is of you
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
know a good an idea to solve a problem
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
that may exist but I don't think this
 
02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
solves the problem it just conf it
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
confuses everybody including me and some
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the people on the committee but how
 
02:32:43.910 --> 02:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
are we going to make a third party
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
insurance company U immediately react
 
02:32:49.870 --> 02:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
when the facts of the accident become
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
quite convoluted but it's a um it's a
 
02:32:54.670 --> 02:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
mix it's a mix of two sides of the qu of
 
02:32:56.590 --> 02:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
the question uh if you have insurance
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
you have great insurance you have a
 
02:32:59.469 --> 02:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive your liability you're
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
going to be fine if you don't have
 
02:33:03.550 --> 02:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
insurance at all again you still have
 
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
the same claim against that third party
 
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
but it's just not going to happen even
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
under this
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
bill I think I got it representative
 
02:33:14.990 --> 02:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
Teresa so um thanks for taking a
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
question so far what you said is
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
basically the time taken between
 
02:33:21.550 --> 02:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
resolving who is at fault not at fault
 
02:33:23.870 --> 02:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
and the administrative processing time
 
02:33:26.590 --> 02:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
but would you agree that at the
 
02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
end the insurance company is going if
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh at at fault they are going to
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
pay for the vehicle if it's totaled or
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
like the person said he will not paid at
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
all I mean what is the current policy or
 
02:33:45.070 --> 02:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
current standard or does it differ by
 
02:33:47.269 --> 02:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
Insurance to insurance company and the
 
02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
policies I apologize I I really
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
well the question okay let me just
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
simplify it are you besides the fact
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
that it takes time yeah to process it at
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
the end of the day when it's processed
 
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the insurance
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
company does pay for the uh Clement in
 
02:34:08.590 --> 02:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
in in in in the in the event of total
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
loss of the vehicle in the scenario that
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
the sponsor presented Liberty Mutual
 
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
will end up paying for the damages to
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
that person now it may take that person
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
having file a suit but believe me as a
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
lawy there's plenty of people out there
 
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
who take that will damage also include
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
paying for rental vehicle that is what
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
was was that rental will be part of your
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
claimed damages you would claim loss of
 
02:34:31.309 --> 02:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
use of the car if you got whiplash so
 
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes they would get paid
 
02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
yes but over time yeah okay okay thank
 
02:34:39.510 --> 02:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
you so now I'm I'm kind of looking at
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsor say could this have been
 
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
what happened could have been because
 
02:34:48.269 --> 02:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
the policy holder
 
02:34:52.830 --> 02:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
the did not not have Car Coverage in
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
their policy rental car then when they
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
said to their insurance company because
 
02:35:04.110 --> 02:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
my I hear the story is is that you know
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of whose fault or not fault
 
02:35:08.469 --> 02:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
they send you the check is quick
 
02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
is like a jack rabbit they want to send
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
you the check sometimes it's too too
 
02:35:15.910 --> 02:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
little right and you don't necessarily
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
want to your own comprehensive okay and
 
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
but but is if you if if the person had
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
the car rental in their
 
02:35:27.389 --> 02:35:27.399 align:start position:0%
policy then their insurance company
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely would have said fine we'll
 
02:35:32.269 --> 02:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
take care of this and we'll get our
 
02:35:34.990 --> 02:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
money back once the case has been
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
settled but if he didn't have that in
 
02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:38.590 align:start position:0%
settled but if he didn't have that in
his

02:35:38.590 --> 02:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
policy the insurance company says is um
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
you're you didn't claim it so we're not
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
going to cover that we'll have to wait
 
02:35:50.510 --> 02:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
until the case is settled
 
02:35:54.030 --> 02:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
and the other party does admit that
 
02:35:56.269 --> 02:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
they're fully responsible the other
 
02:35:57.950 --> 02:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
insurance company takes the full
 
02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility and says it's a total and
 
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
at that point in time he the um um
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
original policy holder I guess would
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
then hand the bill for the car rental
 
02:36:16.110 --> 02:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
to yeah as a matter of fact what happens
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
many times is an adjuster will come out
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
and say to you okay we to car it's
 
02:36:23.070 --> 02:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
$155,000 uh what else do you have to
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
claim well you broke my antique phase
 
02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
was in the front seat I rented the car
 
02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
for two weeks was 1,300 bucks okay we'll
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
give you 25,000 so that third party
 
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
adjuster representing State Liberty
 
02:36:36.269 --> 02:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
Mutual will come to you and say okay
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
let's let's s let's finish make a SLE
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
try to make a settlement then you know
 
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
usually it's too low well it's usually
 
02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
fair but again there is a there is a
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
process where the the innocent third
 
02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
party will be approached by the the
 
02:36:55.710 --> 02:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
carrier who has the 100% ATA driver and
 
02:36:57.790 --> 02:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
they will attempt to settle the thing as
 
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
fast as you know settle the thing uh
 
02:37:02.990 --> 02:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
quickly right but if the person who is
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
not at fault does not want to accept
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
that settlement offer then they get into
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
the uh details of how do I now recover
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
which is either um I guess hiring lawyer
 
02:37:18.230 --> 02:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
uing Mr X who is insured by Mutual of
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
Omaha whoever it might be to get all
 
02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
those damages but again it's it's a
 
02:37:24.030 --> 02:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
contractual issue as representa mcer
 
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
said before uh when you look at the
 
02:37:28.830 --> 02:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
contract you get what the contract calls
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
for now because you don't have it in
 
02:37:33.070 --> 02:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
your contract doesn't give you a leap
 
02:37:35.150 --> 02:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
over to the other side to automatically
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
get that benefit uh you have to um you
 
02:37:40.269 --> 02:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
know a lot of people with older cars
 
02:37:42.990 --> 02:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
only by liability insurance uh the car
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
is not you know worth the premium to
 
02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
have it repaired I got a couple I got a
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
couple old sobs can't get for Subs
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
anymore but uh so it's a you know the
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
the the thought that somebody's been
 
02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted by that particular
 
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
scenario of those facts it probably
 
02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
happens uh more than we want to admit
 
02:38:04.830 --> 02:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
but again the process is available for
 
02:38:07.630 --> 02:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
that person to get 100% recovery again
 
02:38:11.309 --> 02:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.319 --> 02:38:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
process

02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:17.309 --> 02:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
okay wait till the subcommittee we'll
 
02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
figure it okay well go ahead the
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
hungry now I'm intimidated now I don't
 
02:38:31.230 --> 02:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
know what to do have you have you seen
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
cases we talked about what if they don't
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
have liability insurance and I'm not the
 
02:38:38.790 --> 02:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
ATA person but there are also
 
02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
cases where and and I know of these
 
02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
cases where I don't want my insurance
 
02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
company involved because I don't want my
 
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
rates to go up so I'm going to try to
 
02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
deal only with the atfa person who is
 
02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
the other insurance company do you see
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
those kinds of cases oh sure sure some
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
people just want to pay out of pocket so
 
02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
they don't have to make a claim because
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
that what's that little fox who does all
 
02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
the um Carfax things you have an the
 
02:39:07.870 --> 02:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
Carfax information comes from the repair
 
02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
facilities so yeah if you sitting there
 
02:39:13.269 --> 02:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
and You've Got U 100% the guy as in the
 
02:39:16.269 --> 02:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
sario that somebody backs right into you
 
02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
and you say the last thing I want to do
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
is contact Liberty Mutual tell them you
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
got a claim so you say that U insurance
 
02:39:25.309 --> 02:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
company x what is it going to take to
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
get this thing settled and again if the
 
02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
Injustice says uh here's $5 you're going
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
to no I I I can't do that and you need
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
that then you need some coverage you'll
 
02:39:35.150 --> 02:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
go back to your company but initially
 
02:39:36.429 --> 02:39:36.439 align:start position:0%
some people don't go to their own
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
company for the very reason of the
 
02:39:42.510 --> 02:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
history on the car and the um you know
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
it just it's more convenient or they
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
feel less uh that they're going to get
 
02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
hit with a break but 100% if you're 100
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
100% innocent which is kind of up back
 
02:39:54.269 --> 02:39:54.279 align:start position:0%
if you're not at fault your rates don't
 
02:39:54.279 --> 02:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
if you're not at fault your rates don't
go

02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
up he
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
said I've always said that the best
 
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
thing you can have is if you get in an
 
02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
auto accident and the other person said
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
fault just hope they don't have
 
02:40:06.030 --> 02:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
insurance because that way you don't
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
have to deal with their insurance
 
02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
company at all it's just your own okay

to be before you today to testify in
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 507 relative to
 
03:50:34.910 --> 03:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
the timeline for credentialing of mental
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
health providers for several years now
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
we have all heard about the serious
 
03:50:42.870 --> 03:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
challenges our state faces in
 
03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
ensuring adequate and timely mental and
 
03:50:47.670 --> 03:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Care Services are
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
available for our citizens both parties
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
have taken important steps to address
 
03:50:55.269 --> 03:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
these challenges but much work remains
 
03:50:59.309 --> 03:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
before us in September of 2024 a report
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Behavioral Health
 
03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce Center at Dartmouth Health
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
noted that Workforce shortages in New
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Behavioral Health Care
 
03:51:10.269 --> 03:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
sector have reached alarming levels and
 
03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
have stayed at those levels for nearly a
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
decade despite heroic effort from
 
03:51:17.389 --> 03:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
leaders of all SE from all sectors many
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire who are in
 
03:51:21.630 --> 03:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
clear need of Behavioral Health support
 
03:51:24.510 --> 03:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
are not getting sufficient help more
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
recently Roland Lamey executive director
 
03:51:29.110 --> 03:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Community
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Association noted a
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
lack of mental health professionals
 
03:51:35.309 --> 03:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult for patients to
 
03:51:38.229 --> 03:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
access Mental Health Services there is
 
03:51:40.750 --> 03:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
no one way to solve this challenge it
 
03:51:43.469 --> 03:51:43.479 align:start position:0%
will take several approaches one of
 
03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
these ways that we can do it is with the
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 507 which requires Health
 
03:51:50.469 --> 03:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
carriers to process credentialing
 
03:51:52.590 --> 03:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
applications by Mental Health Providers
 
03:51:55.469 --> 03:51:55.479 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of submission to a
 
03:51:58.229 --> 03:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
complete application this bill helps to
 
03:52:00.189 --> 03:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
address a bottleneck with onboarding
 
03:52:02.469 --> 03:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
mental health providers which can take
 
03:52:05.229 --> 03:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
months at times the current Law requires
 
03:52:07.189 --> 03:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
Health carriers to credential primary
 
03:52:09.309 --> 03:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
care physicians within 30 days of
 
03:52:11.950 --> 03:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
reeding receiving an application and the
 
03:52:13.830 --> 03:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
bill would extend that requirement to
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health providers with carriers
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
required to cover health care services
 
03:52:21.189 --> 03:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
and treatments as in network
 
03:52:22.830 --> 03:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
retroactively from the date of
 
03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
credentialing application submission by
 
03:52:27.950 --> 03:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
the provider in her inaugural address
 
03:52:31.149 --> 03:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
just a few weeks ago Governor aat noted
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
as I've traveled across New Hampshire I
 
03:52:36.110 --> 03:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
have heard firsthand about the urgent
 
03:52:38.149 --> 03:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
need to improve our Mental Health Care
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
System there are not enough providers
 
03:52:44.030 --> 03:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 507 will help to address this
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
challenge by quickening the pace at
 
03:52:48.149 --> 03:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
which Mental Health Providers are on
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
boarded in New Hampshire holding Health
 
03:52:52.590 --> 03:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
carriers to the same standards for
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
credentialing Mental Health Providers as
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
they currently are for primary care
 
03:53:01.070 --> 03:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
physicians as Governor aat uh concluded
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
when addressing behavioral health during
 
03:53:05.950 --> 03:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
her inaugural speech seeking care for
 
03:53:08.149 --> 03:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
your mental health is just as important
 
03:53:09.670 --> 03:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
as going to the doctor when you're
 
03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
feeling sick or dealing with a physical
 
03:53:15.070 --> 03:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
injury we all need to work together on
 
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
this and take care of each other I
 
03:53:20.070 --> 03:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time today I'm happy to
 
03:53:21.790 --> 03:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
try to answer some questions but I do
 
03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
know that someone from lifestance health
 
03:53:25.710 --> 03:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
is here and they'll be able to testify
 
03:53:28.349 --> 03:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
more to the
 
03:53:31.110 --> 03:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
particulars so make sure I understand
 
03:53:35.229 --> 03:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
because I'm reading the bill MH and it
 
03:53:37.309 --> 03:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
looks like this is already
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
law right I mean 30 calendar days um it
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
so what is it about these these little
 
03:53:50.910 --> 03:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
bullace and moving Specialists from one
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
place to the other why what makes this
 
03:53:57.389 --> 03:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
bill necessary what as compar compared
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
to what's going on in the current law
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
sure well we already have it for primary
 
03:54:02.950 --> 03:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
care physicians that's within 30 days
 
03:54:04.830 --> 03:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
this is adding mental health care
 
03:54:06.790 --> 03:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
providers currently that is not in
 
03:54:09.189 --> 03:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
statute that it's within 30 days I see
 
03:54:11.550 --> 03:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
no reason that we can't also do that see
 
03:54:14.110 --> 03:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
primary care and mental health providers
 
03:54:14.120 --> 03:54:15.349 align:start position:0%
primary care and mental health providers
yes

03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
I see okay I I just wasn't seeing
 
03:54:18.800 --> 03:54:20.309 align:start position:0%
I see okay I I just wasn't seeing
it

03:54:20.309 --> 03:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:54:23.229 --> 03:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
okay question representative burough
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%

03:54:31.630 --> 03:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
think that when I'm looking at the 30
 
03:54:33.389 --> 03:54:33.399 align:start position:0%
days do you think that maybe there's a
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
distinction between you talked about
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
clean applications between that and I
 
03:54:40.590 --> 03:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
would categorize them as low medium and
 
03:54:43.550 --> 03:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
highrisk applicants because beyond the
 
03:54:46.429 --> 03:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
clinical say here quality and clinical
 
03:54:49.030 --> 03:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's other factors I mean some people
 
03:54:54.309 --> 03:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
there may be a um a criminal record um
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
maybe the person uh did residency in
 
03:54:59.469 --> 03:54:59.479 align:start position:0%
another country do you see situations
 
03:55:01.710 --> 03:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
where it could take more than 30 days
 
03:55:03.149 --> 03:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I appreciate
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
that I think that there are always
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances however I
 
03:55:09.950 --> 03:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't feel that this is any different
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
than a primary care provider and if
 
03:55:14.030 --> 03:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
they've already been able to it's been
 
03:55:15.269 --> 03:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
proven proven that they can do that
 
03:55:17.189 --> 03:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
within 30 days with the primary care I
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
see no why no reason why we can't open
 
03:55:21.189 --> 03:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
this up to mental health I started
 
03:55:23.070 --> 03:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
looking at mental health bottlenecks a
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
couple years ago because we do have so
 
03:55:26.790 --> 03:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
many it's been very challenging to get
 
03:55:29.070 --> 03:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
providers so it's where is that Hiccup
 
03:55:31.030 --> 03:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
and part of it is that it takes so long
 
03:55:33.229 --> 03:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
in this state currently to get that
 
03:55:35.550 --> 03:55:35.560 align:start position:0%
licensing and credentialing so I know
 
03:55:36.830 --> 03:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
that they're very thorough they make
 
03:55:38.349 --> 03:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
sure about the you know criminal
 
03:55:40.670 --> 03:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
background and all that but we just have
 
03:55:44.429 --> 03:55:44.439 align:start position:0%
areas where we've either over legislated
 
03:55:46.309 --> 03:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
and kind of held the mental health care
 
03:55:49.510 --> 03:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
into a certain area or in this case um
 
03:55:51.030 --> 03:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're kind of letting it fledgling out
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
there and not holding it to the same you
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
know importance that we are primary care
 
03:55:57.750 --> 03:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
providers for the question Meir would
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
you believe this is a would you believe
 
03:56:01.950 --> 03:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
not question
 
03:56:05.309 --> 03:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
um looking around the country there are
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
so many cases of credent poor
 
03:56:11.469 --> 03:56:11.479 align:start position:0%
credentialing that has ended up poorly
 
03:56:14.469 --> 03:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
for the patient so I would just suggest
 
03:56:17.349 --> 03:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
there are probably some some for both
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians and for for medal healthare
 
03:56:21.429 --> 03:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
providers where it makes sense to slow
 
03:56:21.439 --> 03:56:22.950 align:start position:0%
providers where it makes sense to slow
down

03:56:22.950 --> 03:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:56:27.469 --> 03:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
thanks would you believe I know you did
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
twice this was it would you believe okay
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:56:37.710 --> 03:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh chair will call on
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:46.269 --> 03:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
it's also Alex and Michelle you guys
 
03:56:47.710 --> 03:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
going to come up at the same time or are
 
03:56:48.990 --> 03:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
they going to treat
 
03:56:51.910 --> 03:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
him come on down we missed you Mr
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
chairman it had been too long since we
 
03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
were here this morning we just had to
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
come back just can't stay away
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much DJ beton Court
 
03:57:02.950 --> 03:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner Michelle Heaton
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
the head of our life and health division
 
03:57:07.630 --> 03:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
so broadly speaking Mr chairman we are
 
03:57:11.110 --> 03:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
in support of what the sponsor is trying
 
03:57:13.910 --> 03:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
to achieve in this bill I think she
 
03:57:15.950 --> 03:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
raised some of the important points with
 
03:57:19.550 --> 03:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
respect to getting sufficient Workforce
 
03:57:22.510 --> 03:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
in place to deal with the demand for
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
mental health services that is currently
 
03:57:27.309 --> 03:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
in the state my understanding in some of
 
03:57:28.990 --> 03:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
the private conversations that I've had
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
with the carriers is that they can live
 
03:57:34.149 --> 03:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
with including the mental health
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
professionals in the 30-day window along
 
03:57:41.870 --> 03:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
with the pcps Primary Care Professionals
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
to your point representative Burrows
 
03:57:46.990 --> 03:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
remember that the carrier always has the
 
03:57:49.389 --> 03:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
ability should there be something in the
 
03:57:51.990 --> 03:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
credentialing process that Flags to deny
 
03:57:54.469 --> 03:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
credentialing if there's a criminal
 
03:57:57.189 --> 03:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
record or there's some other reason that
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
the carrier feels this individual should
 
03:58:02.590 --> 03:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
not be credentialed to be in network
 
03:58:04.630 --> 03:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
with them I'll point out a couple of
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
different things just that I hope are
 
03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:09.399 align:start position:0%
helpful for you in terms of background
 
03:58:12.030 --> 03:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to credentialing so when
 
03:58:15.309 --> 03:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
credentialing first came into existence
 
03:58:17.510 --> 03:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
when the legislature first uh
 
03:58:19.870 --> 03:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
implemented credentialing it was
 
03:58:23.510 --> 03:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
intended as a quality of service measure
 
03:58:26.189 --> 03:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
it was a a measure that ensured that
 
03:58:28.590 --> 03:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
individuals were getting the appropriate
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
care from professionals who were
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
qualified and experienced and educated
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
to be able to render those services that
 
03:58:38.990 --> 03:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
you were not just having people get
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
services from Fly by Night
 
03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
individuals Over time however what we
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
have seen is the credentialing process
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
be viewed and in certain circumstances
 
03:58:54.830 --> 03:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
experienced by providers as something of
 
03:58:58.110 --> 03:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
a barrier to their ability to to be able
 
03:59:01.269 --> 03:59:01.279 align:start position:0%
to practice now I think the state over
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
the past several years has taken a
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
number of steps to address the workforce
 
03:59:08.110 --> 03:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
challenges that the state has
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
particularly as it pertains to
 
03:59:11.269 --> 03:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
behavioral health as well as other
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
professions and I'm speaking of things
 
03:59:15.950 --> 03:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
like the Li your reciprocity reforms
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
that you've brought forward trying to
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate some of those barriers from
 
03:59:23.189 --> 03:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
people being able to enter the
 
03:59:26.189 --> 03:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
workforce I think the first half of this
 
03:59:29.990 --> 03:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill achieves a bit of a balance between
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
preserving the quality of care ensuring
 
03:59:35.469 --> 03:59:35.479 align:start position:0%
that people are accessing a
 
03:59:38.309 --> 03:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
well-qualified appropriate provider
 
03:59:39.870 --> 03:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
while ensuring that it is not an
 
03:59:41.670 --> 03:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
impediment for that individual to be
 
03:59:44.910 --> 03:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
able to start taking patients and Bill
 
03:59:47.590 --> 03:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
and all of the things that are important
 
03:59:49.630 --> 03:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
for that individual for that
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
professional the second half of the bill
 
03:59:53.870 --> 03:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I have indicated this to a
 
03:59:56.469 --> 03:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
representative from lifestance who
 
03:59:58.950 --> 03:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
approached us about our thoughts on this
 
04:00:01.469 --> 04:00:01.479 align:start position:0%
bill the second half of it is a bit
 
04:00:03.550 --> 04:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
problematic and the reason that it is
 
04:00:05.070 --> 04:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
problematic is
 
04:00:07.510 --> 04:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
because you know at the end of the day
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
when we hear from providers about the
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
pain points that they're
 
04:00:13.710 --> 04:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
having yes credentialing can sometimes
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
be a source of irritation and agitation
 
04:00:19.630 --> 04:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
to be sure but the biggest challenge
 
04:00:21.269 --> 04:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
they have the biggest frustration they
 
04:00:23.229 --> 04:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
have is in the Contracting
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
process and sometimes the credentialing
 
04:00:28.790 --> 04:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
and the Contracting process are
 
04:00:31.630 --> 04:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
simultaneous in exactly how that unfolds
 
04:00:33.149 --> 04:00:33.159 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different carrier to
 
04:00:34.950 --> 04:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
carrier for example I know that there is
 
04:00:38.030 --> 04:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
one carrier who will not begin the the
 
04:00:39.910 --> 04:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
credentialing process until they have
 
04:00:41.950 --> 04:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
reached an
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
agreement have a contract in hand with
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
that provider for them to be in network
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
once that is in place then they'll begin
 
04:00:50.990 --> 04:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
the credentialing process and so there's
 
04:00:54.389 --> 04:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
no friction between the credentialing in
 
04:00:57.469 --> 04:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
the negotiation piece another carrier
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
does credentialing in in uh Contracting
 
04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
simultaneously at the same time and that
 
04:01:06.590 --> 04:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think is where one of the more
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
obvious hiccups with that second section
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
arises in the sense that okay the
 
04:01:14.189 --> 04:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
individuals credentialed in the third 30
 
04:01:16.510 --> 04:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
days you're giving them this ability to
 
04:01:16.520 --> 04:01:17.870 align:start position:0%
days you're giving them this ability to
retroactively

04:01:17.870 --> 04:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
bill but retroactively Bild to what
 
04:01:23.469 --> 04:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
because they don't have a contract in
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
place they haven't agreed upon the
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
rates so that I don't know how that
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
works for that particular
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
reason so what I have said to the some
 
04:01:40.149 --> 04:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
of the supporters of the legislation is
 
04:01:41.950 --> 04:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
we will engage heavily with the
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee during the subcommittee
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
process and we will see if there is some
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
workable language to address that second
 
04:01:52.030 --> 04:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
piece but in terms of the first section
 
04:01:54.429 --> 04:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
I think that's fairly straightforward I
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't know that that needs too much work
 
04:01:58.030 --> 04:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
and again I think you've got some
 
04:02:00.510 --> 04:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
consensus that the carriers can live
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
with that and so again if we're able to
 
04:02:05.630 --> 04:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
speed up that process to get those
 
04:02:07.950 --> 04:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
professionals into the workforce taking
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
clients helping people I think we're all
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
in support of that and again it's the
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
right balance because you're
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
not junking the credentialing process
 
04:02:20.790 --> 04:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
alog together we're just Expediting that
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
and again if there are issues that come
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
up the carrier always retains the
 
04:02:26.950 --> 04:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
ability to deny the credential before I
 
04:02:28.149 --> 04:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
take your questions I'll look to
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
Michelle is there anything you got to
 
04:02:31.590 --> 04:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
clean up no I guess I did all right on
 
04:02:33.550 --> 04:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
that one thank you Mr chairman happy to
 
04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
take questions uh we do represent pus
 
04:02:39.630 --> 04:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:02:41.830 --> 04:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question I'm
 
04:02:45.149 --> 04:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my hand around what you
 
04:02:49.030 --> 04:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
saying about the company has a has will
 
04:02:52.750 --> 04:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
have a agreement with the
 
04:02:55.389 --> 04:02:55.399 align:start position:0%
provider even though they have not
 
04:02:57.389 --> 04:02:57.399 align:start position:0%
qualified the
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
provider that in my head says this
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
insurance company now has a contract
 
04:03:07.510 --> 04:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
with an unqualified provider which is
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
not good for the general public would
 
04:03:09.840 --> 04:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
not good for the general public would
you

04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
believe I I uh these days I'll believe
 
04:03:16.349 --> 04:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
darn near or anything but what I would
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
say is typically how it works and again
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
Michelle can correct me if I'm mistaken
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
there will be a provision within that
 
04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
contract that stipulates that the
 
04:03:27.550 --> 04:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
individual must be credentialed in order
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
for the contract to go into effect so
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
they'll have the contract in terms of
 
04:03:33.950 --> 04:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
the negotiated rates and the billing
 
04:03:35.950 --> 04:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
codes and all of that stuff but it will
 
04:03:38.670 --> 04:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
also say all of this is contingent upon
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
the individual being successfully
 
04:03:44.750 --> 04:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
credentialed thank you
 
04:03:46.750 --> 04:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative burrow thank you thank
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do you think it
 
04:03:50.670 --> 04:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
would make sense to have just a clause
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
in there to say that it could go beyond
 
04:03:54.550 --> 04:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
30 days if they were extenda
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances like somebody's and
 
04:03:58.149 --> 04:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
somebody's records didn't come back from
 
04:04:00.030 --> 04:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
overseas or just something like that I
 
04:04:01.710 --> 04:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
think there is flexibility but I'm going
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
to defer to Michelle on those specifics
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
so the current statute requires a clean
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
application and the clean application
 
04:04:11.389 --> 04:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
um the definition of that is that they
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
have everything they need to make that
 
04:04:14.790 --> 04:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
decision so if they needed additional
 
04:04:16.950 --> 04:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
information that they would request that
 
04:04:18.790 --> 04:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
information that kind of stops the clock
 
04:04:22.110 --> 04:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
okay um I think the way the statute is
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
currently written there is um no way to
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
get around those time limits and just to
 
04:04:30.149 --> 04:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
clarify too the 45 days is for
 
04:04:32.070 --> 04:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
Specialists and currently Mental Health
 
04:04:34.510 --> 04:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
Providers would fall under that 45 days
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not that under the current
 
04:04:37.870 --> 04:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
statute there are no time limitations
 
04:04:39.630 --> 04:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
it's just they would fall into the 45
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
day bucket as opposed to 30 days great
 
04:04:48.110 --> 04:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:50.670 --> 04:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um if
 
04:04:52.950 --> 04:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have this metric now perhaps
 
04:04:54.830 --> 04:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
we can have it for the subcommittee but
 
04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how big of a problem this
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
is so do we know out of X number of
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
mental health providers that have been
 
04:05:06.429 --> 04:05:06.439 align:start position:0%
credentialed how many take longer than
 
04:05:10.990 --> 04:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
you know this uh 45 days and um because
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if this is a problem or or
 
04:05:18.750 --> 04:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
if it might be um not really addressing
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
what the critical aspect is so I would
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
say that certainly from the perspective
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
of the providers there's a problem and
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
so when they come to me and ask me about
 
04:05:29.070 --> 04:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on and they're raising
 
04:05:30.510 --> 04:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
these concerns it obviously becomes a
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
problem for me but what I would say is
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
the reason that credentialing is a
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
problem is different for different
 
04:05:39.670 --> 04:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
providers some of them don't fully
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the concept of the the clean
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
application and they didn't appreciate
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
that they needed a a number of different
 
04:05:47.590 --> 04:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
other pieces of information to be
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
included in that so sometimes it's just
 
04:05:51.990 --> 04:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
a matter of being able to clarify that
 
04:05:55.110 --> 04:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
situation for them in other cases the
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
carriers have taken longer than they
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
should and we obviously address that
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
with the carriers U but there are a
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
number of different issues that can come
 
04:06:05.870 --> 04:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
up uh and it's different as I've said
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
for every provider but it is a bit of a
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
problem and as I've said what I don't
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
want to see is for there to be a ground
 
04:06:13.199 --> 04:06:14.990 align:start position:0%
want to see is for there to be a ground
sell

04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
sell
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
frustration with credentialing
 
04:06:20.349 --> 04:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
potentially being an impediment to
 
04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
getting folks into the workforce to deal
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
with the mental health demands of the
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
state such that we start having
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
conversations about why we need
 
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
credentialing in the first place which
 
04:06:31.630 --> 04:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
as I've said is an important safety
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
measure that's in place so what we're
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
trying to do is bring forward uh I think
 
04:06:39.550 --> 04:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
what we see here is the opportunity for
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
there to be a safe and pragmatic
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
compromise that preserves credentialing
 
04:06:46.630 --> 04:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
but also ensures that it's not an
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
impediment to Workforce being able to
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
come in Michelle are there other
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
problems with credentialing that should
 
04:06:55.149 --> 04:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
be highlighted that we hear from that we
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
hear from providers about we don't
 
04:06:59.670 --> 04:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily have data um with respect to
 
04:07:01.830 --> 04:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
what you asking for because it's not
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily clean clut it's not part of
 
04:07:06.269 --> 04:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
um any of the data submissions that we
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
routinely get data on um but there are a
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
lot of misconceptions between the
 
04:07:13.830 --> 04:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
credentialing datee and the contract ing
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
date and that's I think um a common
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
thing that people get hung up on and
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
they think just because their
 
04:07:20.670 --> 04:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
credentialing is complete that means
 
04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
that they should be able to Bill but
 
04:07:23.550 --> 04:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily have a contract
 
04:07:24.990 --> 04:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
and there are no time limits for
 
04:07:27.429 --> 04:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
Contracting because um at the end of the
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
day it's up to the parties to come to an
 
04:07:30.510 --> 04:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
agreement and sometimes those contract
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
negotiations can take a prolonged period
 
04:07:32.800 --> 04:07:34.670 align:start position:0%
negotiations can take a prolonged period
of

04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
time representative miles thank you Mr
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:07:41.950 --> 04:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
question um for the benefit of the
 
04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee and the viewers at home home
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
and if I'm directing this question to
 
04:07:48.189 --> 04:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
the wrong person please correct me um
 
04:07:51.950 --> 04:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
would you be able to explain um how this
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill would be beneficial to decreasing
 
04:07:57.870 --> 04:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
the congestion in emergency departments
 
04:08:00.189 --> 04:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
around the
 
04:08:03.070 --> 04:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
state boy that's a that's a complicated
 
04:08:05.269 --> 04:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
question to a very serious challenge the
 
04:08:05.279 --> 04:08:07.630 align:start position:0%
question to a very serious challenge the
state

04:08:07.630 --> 04:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:10.590 --> 04:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
has let me answer it this way as a
 
04:08:10.600 --> 04:08:11.750 align:start position:0%
has let me answer it this way as a
matter

04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
matter
 
04:08:15.149 --> 04:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
of kind of philosophy I guess my belief
 
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
is that if we are able to get
 
04:08:20.349 --> 04:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
individuals into behavioral health
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
treatment in less acute settings that's
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
always better you're not having a
 
04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
situation where the individual can't get
 
04:08:31.830 --> 04:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
access to a therapist or somebody who
 
04:08:35.950 --> 04:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
can engage in intensive um Talk therapy
 
04:08:38.830 --> 04:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
or the other services that these
 
04:08:40.269 --> 04:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Counselors and
 
04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
providers give um
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
if if the individual can't access those
 
04:08:48.109 --> 04:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
Services then their problem is going to
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
compound it's going to get worse until
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
you reach the the breaking point in
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
which the individual then needs to
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
access the ER and obviously you are all
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
familiar with the fact that um the
 
04:09:02.870 --> 04:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
process and it's certainly better than
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
it was several years ago but the process
 
04:09:07.070 --> 04:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
of getting people into New Hampshire
 
04:09:09.630 --> 04:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
hospital is sometimes challenging lack
 
04:09:13.349 --> 04:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
of beds the fact that before individ
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
uals would be in New Hampshire hospital
 
04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
and would have to stay there for longer
 
04:09:19.950 --> 04:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
periods of time because we hadn't really
 
04:09:22.670 --> 04:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
stood up a lot of the step down services
 
04:09:25.469 --> 04:09:25.479 align:start position:0%
for an individual who was leaving New
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital to not just have it
 
04:09:29.349 --> 04:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
be a situation where they were
 
04:09:31.389 --> 04:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
discharged from the Hampshire hospital
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
and the attitude was basically goodbye
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
good luck you're all set well no that
 
04:09:38.590 --> 04:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
individual needed that followon care and
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
again I think the state has done a good
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
job of investing in those step down
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
services so that it's not just this
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
revolving door of an individual being in
 
04:09:48.990 --> 04:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
the ER into New Hampshire hospital back
 
04:09:52.189 --> 04:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
home back to the ER in a way in a way
 
04:09:55.149 --> 04:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
and a way it goes so I think again
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
anytime you can
 
04:09:59.429 --> 04:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
bring more capacity to some of those
 
04:10:01.510 --> 04:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
less acute services to try to deal with
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
the individual's challenge before it
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
reaches the point where they need to
 
04:10:08.189 --> 04:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
access an acute care setting is always a
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
good thing do we have statistics and
 
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
hard data on that I don't but that is my
 
04:10:14.720 --> 04:10:16.229 align:start position:0%
hard data on that I don't but that is my
fundamental

04:10:16.229 --> 04:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
04:10:20.030 --> 04:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
belief very small followup
 
04:10:22.710 --> 04:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay I am under the impression and
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
please would you believe that um I think
 
04:10:29.710 --> 04:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
this bill will help in the actual
 
04:10:32.109 --> 04:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
congestion for patients who are already
 
04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
sitting in the Ed waiting for an
 
04:10:37.389 --> 04:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
evaluation and can't get one in a timely
 
04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
manner meaning not even in 24 hours
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
they're sitting there waiting for a
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
qualified mental health evaluator to be
 
04:10:47.710 --> 04:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
available to come and see them else
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
they're stuck in that department for who
 
04:10:53.950 --> 04:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
knows weeks sometimes without a doubt I
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
think it certainly has the potential to
 
04:10:57.950 --> 04:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
help I think the biggest barriers in
 
04:11:00.990 --> 04:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
that process are again it depends on the
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
nature of why the individual is there if
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's an iea process then you're going
 
04:11:07.349 --> 04:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
to have to wait obviously for there to
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
be a Judicial hearing on that and again
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a lot of the folks who are
 
04:11:15.550 --> 04:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
in the zers need access to New Hampshire
 
04:11:17.710 --> 04:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
hospital but to your point if there's
 
04:11:19.149 --> 04:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
the ability for somebody to be able to
 
04:11:21.550 --> 04:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
get in there and evaluate that person
 
04:11:23.469 --> 04:11:23.479 align:start position:0%
and they determine that they don't need
 
04:11:26.149 --> 04:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital level of care
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
well then we can move th that individual
 
04:11:31.229 --> 04:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
out of the ER and on a pathway toward
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
whatever less acute uh options are
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
available to address their particular
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%

context is one of the largest behavioral

health providers in the state of New
 
04:12:38.229 --> 04:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we employ over 210 clinicians
 
04:12:42.269 --> 04:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
and we have 13 locations uh in 2024 we

treated almost 27,000 New Hampshire

residents uh through 264,000
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
visits um so we are very committed to
 
04:12:54.670 --> 04:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
improving access to Behavioral Health in
 
04:12:57.429 --> 04:12:57.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I'm here to testify
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
today in support of House Bill 507
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
relative the to the timeline of
 
04:13:05.109 --> 04:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
credentialing we've experienced the high
 
04:13:07.149 --> 04:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
demand for Behavioral Health Care
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
Services which have skyrocketed
 
04:13:11.710 --> 04:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
particularly in The Last 5 Years and the
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
workforce has had TR trouble keeping up
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
with the demand um the bill today before
 
04:13:19.870 --> 04:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
you requires Insurance to process uh
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
credential applications by Mental Health
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
Providers within the 30 days from a
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
clean application uh this is important
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
at times because historically uh those
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
credentialing timelines could be 60 90
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
and upwards of 120 days in the past that
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
we've experience which is slowing down
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
the process and a direct barrier to
 
04:13:42.479 --> 04:13:43.710 align:start position:0%
the process and a direct barrier to
access

04:13:43.710 --> 04:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:13:45.550 --> 04:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
um currently as reflected the law
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
requires Insurance to credential pcps
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
within the 30 days this bill would
 
04:13:52.349 --> 04:13:52.359 align:start position:0%
extend that requirement to Mental Health
 
04:13:54.349 --> 04:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
Providers with carriers required to
 
04:13:57.149 --> 04:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
cover cover health care services and
 
04:13:59.429 --> 04:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
treatments as in network retroactively
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
from the date of credentialing
 
04:14:03.349 --> 04:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
application the retroactive billing
 
04:14:05.790 --> 04:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
provision is very similar to what is
 
04:14:07.710 --> 04:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
permitted by Medicare through the
 
04:14:10.030 --> 04:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
credentialing process and sets the
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
effective billing date as the date of
 
04:14:15.790 --> 04:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
the clean application being received um
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
taken together the provisions of Health
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
Bo Health Bill 507 will address the
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
challenges posted by greater need for
 
04:14:24.229 --> 04:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Services by quickening
 
04:14:26.269 --> 04:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
the pace at which Mental Health
 
04:14:27.830 --> 04:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
Providers are on boarding in New
 
04:14:30.030 --> 04:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire holding Health carriers to the
 
04:14:32.710 --> 04:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
same standards for credentialing um for
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
mental health providers as for primary
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
care physicians and allowing those
 
04:14:39.149 --> 04:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
providers to build retroactively at the
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
time of application once credential and
 
04:14:44.590 --> 04:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to try to answer any questions
 
04:14:47.910 --> 04:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%

04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
for-profit insurance company serving
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
50,000 of our friends and Neighbors in
 
04:15:37.189 --> 04:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we operate in four states
 
04:15:39.229 --> 04:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
Maine New Hampshire Massachusetts and
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island um and here on uh
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
specifically Bill 507 uh we I believe
 
04:15:46.950 --> 04:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
has been stated before like other
 
04:15:49.469 --> 04:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
carriers uh no particular concern with
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
the first part of the bill uh the 30-day
 
04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
limit as we do for the pcps uh that's
 
04:15:57.269 --> 04:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
something we strive to do anyways um so
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's not really a problem there uh there
 
04:16:00.870 --> 04:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
is an issue that we would have though
 
04:16:02.189 --> 04:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
with section two of the bill one that
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
talks about the retroactivity and it's
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
kind of been hinted at and and talked
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
about a little bit that there's really
 
04:16:08.269 --> 04:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
two pieces in all this there's the
 
04:16:09.790 --> 04:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
credentialing and there's the
 
04:16:12.109 --> 04:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
Contracting and they really both need to
 
04:16:13.750 --> 04:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
go together but also point out that
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
section two of this bill adds a Roman
 
04:16:17.950 --> 04:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
numeral 8 to the statute uh it doesn't
 
04:16:19.790 --> 04:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
show you the rest of the statute but
 
04:16:21.790 --> 04:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral and I I'm going to say
 
04:16:23.429 --> 04:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
this because I think Roman numeral 8 as
 
04:16:25.030 --> 04:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
proposed conflicts with Roman numeral
 
04:16:27.189 --> 04:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
six Roman numeral six says nothing in
 
04:16:29.070 --> 04:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
this section shall be construed to
 
04:16:30.670 --> 04:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
require a health carrier to select a
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
healthc care professional as a
 
04:16:34.269 --> 04:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
participating provider solely because
 
04:16:35.950 --> 04:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
they meet the carrier's credentialing
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
verification standards so 8 says once
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
you meet the standards you should be
 
04:16:42.670 --> 04:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
able to uh retroactively be paid for all
 
04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
these things and six says no nothing
 
04:16:47.070 --> 04:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
says just because you're credentialed uh
 
04:16:49.109 --> 04:16:49.119 align:start position:0%
you're actually part of the network and
 
04:16:51.070 --> 04:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
everything else so it really needs both
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
the credentialing and the Contracting
 
04:16:55.109 --> 04:16:55.119 align:start position:0%
piece to be there although I would say
 
04:16:57.109 --> 04:16:57.119 align:start position:0%
that it may not be necessary at all
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
because the contract's going to be
 
04:17:00.910 --> 04:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
negotiated it's going to say when it
 
04:17:02.429 --> 04:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
starts and when it ends and what's
 
04:17:04.830 --> 04:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
covered uh and so really statute any
 
04:17:06.510 --> 04:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
kind of statutory change is probably not
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
necessary but as it stands now it
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
conflicts with six and it doesn't take
 
04:17:12.590 --> 04:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
into consideration the fact that there a
 
04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
cont contract has to be negotiated as
 
04:17:17.149 --> 04:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
well and uh thank you be happy to answer
 
04:17:20.990 --> 04:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
have well good hey look at
 
04:17:24.000 --> 04:17:25.710 align:start position:0%
have well good hey look at
that

04:17:25.710 --> 04:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
perfect chair will call in Paula Rogers
 
04:17:28.920 --> 04:17:30.269 align:start position:0%
perfect chair will call in Paula Rogers
from

04:17:30.269 --> 04:17:30.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.830 --> 04:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
bill may not have had my glasses on
 
04:17:40.349 --> 04:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
anyway good afternoon um chairman hunt
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I just want to
 
04:17:44.429 --> 04:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
be very brief brief uh pretty much my
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
testimony is going to Echo what uh Mr
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
bragon had to say uh when I picked up
 
04:17:53.189 --> 04:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
the bill I thought the first section was
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable for a couple of reasons um
 
04:17:59.910 --> 04:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
the pressure on mental health and the
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
provision of mental health care in the
 
04:18:04.030 --> 04:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
state but also because we've made a big
 
04:18:07.070 --> 04:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
deal about integrating Primary Care with
 
04:18:09.750 --> 04:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
mental health so it seemed to me that if
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
the primary care provision is a 30-day
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
provision if you have a credential
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
mental health worker ready to go to work
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
you contract with them you should get
 
04:18:21.870 --> 04:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
that all done as soon as possible so I
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
didn't think the 30 days was an issue I
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
agree with Mr bragon that the second
 
04:18:29.630 --> 04:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
section is problematic one could be
 
04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
credentialed and if you're an individual
 
04:18:34.910 --> 04:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
practitioner you could actually start
 
04:18:38.550 --> 04:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
working the real issue with the payer is
 
04:18:39.910 --> 04:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get paid unless you
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:18:44.590 --> 04:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
contract and so obviously to everyone's
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
benefit if we could credential and
 
04:18:48.750 --> 04:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
contract as quickly as possible that
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
would make the most sense so I thought
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
the change in paragraph one was
 
04:18:54.990 --> 04:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine uh a little work on
 
04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph two to straighten that out or
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you could State the obvious or
 
04:19:03.870 --> 04:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:03.880 --> 04:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
two

04:19:05.510 --> 04:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
good thank
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
you you got one card left it's being D
 
04:19:11.640 --> 04:19:17.830 align:start position:0%
you you got one card left it's being D
that

04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
I will also be very brief but first I
 
04:19:21.309 --> 04:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
will introduce myself Sabrina Dunlap
 
04:19:22.590 --> 04:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
senior director of government relations
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
for Anthem thank you for the opportunity
 
04:19:27.750 --> 04:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
to speak uh we are opposed to the bill
 
04:19:29.910 --> 04:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
and share similar concerns that have
 
04:19:31.630 --> 04:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
already been raised I would just add
 
04:19:35.149 --> 04:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
that um 30 days I think is more
 
04:19:36.750 --> 04:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
aggressive than most States I just
 
04:19:40.149 --> 04:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out and
 
04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
um I think you know section two
 
04:19:45.389 --> 04:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
we would be in favor of striking that Al
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
together but certainly needs some work
 
04:19:50.429 --> 04:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
if it does stay in so um that is it I'm
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
04:19:55.830 --> 04:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:58.750 --> 04:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
speak represent Speer has a
 
04:20:01.389 --> 04:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you you mentioned that
 
04:20:03.710 --> 04:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's more aggressive than most States
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
what do most states have I can get that
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
for you I just checked with my team
 
04:20:09.790 --> 04:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
earlier and I didn't get the specific
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
data but it just was a comment on the
 
04:20:13.109 --> 04:20:13.119 align:start position:0%
bill when they reviewed it that um it's
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
a faster turnaround time than most
 
04:20:17.229 --> 04:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
states have I'm guessing it's probably
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
45 for most but that's just a guess
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
follow one further question me inquire
 
04:20:26.349 --> 04:20:26.359 align:start position:0%
uh if they can if if a doctor a primary
 
04:20:28.469 --> 04:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
care physician can get credentialed in
 
04:20:31.389 --> 04:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
30 days do you have any reason why a
 
04:20:34.030 --> 04:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
mental health care worker couldn't no I
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
and I don't thank you for the question I
 
04:20:37.590 --> 04:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
don't think it's an issue and I think we
 
04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
also strive to um get the process done
 
04:20:43.149 --> 04:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
faster than 45 days days which is the
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
current law um my point was just in
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
terms of State statutes on the issue I
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
think 30 days is a faster time than most
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
that represent miles thank you very
 
04:20:58.920 --> 04:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
that represent miles thank you very
brief

04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
brief
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
question I just want to clarify so the
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
primary reason your Anthem is opposing
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is because it would be on The
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge of Time frames for getting
 
04:21:09.600 --> 04:21:11.070 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge of Time frames for getting
people

04:21:11.070 --> 04:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:21:12.910 --> 04:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
credentialed thank you for the question
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's the primary reason
 
04:21:16.590 --> 04:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
I was just pointing it out as one of the
 
04:21:19.830 --> 04:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
reasons followup her original reason to
 
04:21:23.710 --> 04:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
be posed was section two thank you
 
04:21:26.990 --> 04:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:27.000 --> 04:21:29.950 align:start position:0%

04:21:29.950 --> 04:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh is there anybody else who would
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
like to speak and Senate Bill 507 see
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:52.560 --> 04:22:11.510 align:start position:0%

04:48:02.910 --> 04:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the public hearing on
 
04:48:05.070 --> 04:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
705 and here from the prime sponsor
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative Emmon good afternoon
 
04:48:14.110 --> 04:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
repres good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:48:16.990 --> 04:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
the handsome and beautiful Commerce
 
04:48:19.470 --> 04:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
Committee uh you know you made it to the
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
big time when a department asked you to
 
04:48:26.270 --> 04:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
file a bill so yay for me um so this
 
04:48:27.788 --> 04:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
bill is the request of the insurance
 
04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
department and I'm just going to go
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
through a little bit of testimony I'm
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
not an expert on the bill um it's
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
basically uh a transparency Bill and uh
 
04:48:40.868 --> 04:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
some rules around how to make
 
04:48:40.878 --> 04:48:42.190 align:start position:0%
some rules around how to make
information

04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:48:44.430 --> 04:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
transparent uh it it aims to increase
 
04:48:47.548 --> 04:48:47.558 align:start position:0%
transparency in healthcare by requiring
 
04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
Health carriers to disclose specific
 
04:48:51.948 --> 04:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
cost information regarding covered items
 
04:48:54.510 --> 04:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
and services under a health benefit plan
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
it applies to all Health carriers
 
04:48:57.070 --> 04:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
operating in our state including
 
04:48:58.868 --> 04:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and thirdparty
 
04:49:00.628 --> 04:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
administrators these entities will be
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
required to make publicly available
 
04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
certain information about the cost of
 
04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
covered items and services including
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
negotiated rates within Network
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
providers out of network allowed amounts
 
04:49:11.948 --> 04:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
and historical net prices for
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs the bill will improve
 
04:49:16.750 --> 04:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
transparency in several ways first it
 
04:49:18.750 --> 04:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
will provide consumers with access to
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
accurate and up-to-date information
 
04:49:23.350 --> 04:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
about the cost of Health Care
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
Services enabling them to make informed
 
04:49:27.390 --> 04:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
decisions about their
 
04:49:30.110 --> 04:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
care second it will allow employers and
 
04:49:32.670 --> 04:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
individuals to compare prices across
 
04:49:35.310 --> 04:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
different health care plans and
 
04:49:37.470 --> 04:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
providers promoting competition and
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
driving down
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
costs and finally it will able
 
04:49:44.190 --> 04:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
researchers and policy makers to analyze
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
market-wide data and identify Trends and
 
04:49:48.910 --> 04:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
areas for improvement in our Health Care
 
04:49:51.750 --> 04:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
system so by increasing transparency in
 
04:49:55.510 --> 04:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
health care costs HB 705 will help to
 
04:49:58.470 --> 04:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
reduce surprise medical billing decrease
 
04:50:00.430 --> 04:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens on providers
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
potentially and promote a more efficient
 
04:50:06.150 --> 04:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
and patient centered Health Care system
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
so I uh request that you consider this
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
bill and uh
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy to work with you on it
 
04:50:16.910 --> 04:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and any questions I I'll do my
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
best representative buroughs has a
 
04:50:21.430 --> 04:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
question thanks and thanks for taking my
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
question representative um on let's see
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's on
 
04:50:29.868 --> 04:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
page I think it's page two um section
 
04:50:32.590 --> 04:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
two it says that the is this on
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for public disclosure in
 
04:50:37.390 --> 04:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
this subdivision apply to in network
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
provider rates so I'm wondering why
 
04:50:42.390 --> 04:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's in there because if we're talking
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
about insurance carriers or I
 
04:50:46.628 --> 04:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding it in network provider
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
rates yeah um I mean it's just another
 
04:50:51.310 --> 04:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
piece of the information
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
puzzle so it's line 24 yeah it's a jade
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
21 Roman numeral 2 on page two
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so you're talk you're still
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
talking about the insurance there
 
04:51:04.510 --> 04:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
Insurance okay got it thank
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
you so a couple things in the bill that
 
04:51:08.030 --> 04:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
I found interesting if I could point
 
04:51:11.788 --> 04:51:11.798 align:start position:0%
that out of course real quick um um
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of identifiers in there as
 
04:51:15.548 --> 04:51:15.558 align:start position:0%
a database geek that that makes me happy
 
04:51:16.750 --> 04:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of identifiers in
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
there um on page four line
 
04:51:23.948 --> 04:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
three it says nothing in this paragraph
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
requires the disclosure of information
 
04:51:27.548 --> 04:51:27.558 align:start position:0%
that would violate any applicable health
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
information Privacy Law and you'll see
 
04:51:32.910 --> 04:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
that it's kind of there's a aggregation
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
requirement of 20
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh 20 claims so there's some kind of
 
04:51:39.868 --> 04:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
aggregation that you can't drill down
 
04:51:43.470 --> 04:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
into I found that interesting and then
 
04:51:48.070 --> 04:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
four so it talks about machine readable
 
04:51:53.830 --> 04:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
files so this there be data files
 
04:51:55.590 --> 04:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
publicly available on a website that
 
04:51:58.030 --> 04:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
anybody can access that's the idea uh
 
04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
the department I believe it's through
 
04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
rules the department would Define what
 
04:52:03.430 --> 04:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
those what the structure of those data
 
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
files would look like but on page five
 
04:52:09.788 --> 04:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
line four those files could not prevent
 
04:52:11.590 --> 04:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
or will will not prevent compliance with
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
Federal transparency in coverage
 
04:52:15.868 --> 04:52:15.878 align:start position:0%
requirements so there is a
 
04:52:19.110 --> 04:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
federal law I think uh president number
 
04:52:21.470 --> 04:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
45 signed an executive order that
 
04:52:24.310 --> 04:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
created this and eventually I recently
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
found out it's been codified into law
 
04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
but it's the federal transparency and
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
coverage regulation so there's a federal
 
04:52:32.670 --> 04:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh counterpart to
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
this and then
 
04:52:38.990 --> 04:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
finally page five again line
 
04:52:42.430 --> 04:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
24 nothing in the sub subdivision Alters
 
04:52:44.310 --> 04:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
or otherwise affects a healthcare's duty
 
04:52:46.590 --> 04:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
to comply with requirements under other
 
04:52:49.230 --> 04:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
applicable state or federal laws so it'd
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
be fully in compliant with uh state and
 
04:52:51.200 --> 04:52:56.510 align:start position:0%
be fully in compliant with uh state and
federal

04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:00.030 --> 04:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
laws representative peros thanks quick
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
question representative um where was I
 
04:53:07.110 --> 04:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
do you know if um what's stated in here
 
04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
goes beyond what's what the federal what
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
the federal law lays out in terms of
 
04:53:14.910 --> 04:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
transparency does it go beyond I think
 
04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's a complement to it I think it my
 
04:53:19.670 --> 04:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
understanding and maybe somebody coming
 
04:53:21.310 --> 04:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
behind me will have a better
 
04:53:23.350 --> 04:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
understanding but that it's a that it's
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
a complimentary to the federal process
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay that that might just something I'm
 
04:53:30.868 --> 04:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
curious about thanks representative MCL
 
04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:53:35.230 --> 04:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm a little
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
confused here I thought that Health
 
04:53:40.750 --> 04:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
Services had a whole bunch of a
 
04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
different um uh charges I mean they're
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
different depending on who's paying the
 
04:53:48.990 --> 04:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
bill who the payer is how can you be
 
04:53:51.230 --> 04:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
transparent when you have a system like
 
04:53:54.470 --> 04:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
that where it's Peter gets $10 and Paul
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
gets $15 charged right uh I don't know
 
04:53:59.788 --> 04:53:59.798 align:start position:0%
that could be in the in the data format
 
04:54:01.510 --> 04:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how they would do that
 
04:54:03.750 --> 04:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's nodding back there there it
 
04:54:05.430 --> 04:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
could be part of the data structure that
 
04:54:09.190 --> 04:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know identifies the source I'm still
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
confused yeah
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully Alex will clear it up one one
 
04:54:16.750 --> 04:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
final thing another final thing my final
 
04:54:20.590 --> 04:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
final thing final fin the uh the fiscal
 
04:54:22.948 --> 04:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
note has all zeros which I like to
 
04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
see and in speaking with the Department
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
earlier it'll potentially make data
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
analysis easier so it might make their
 
04:54:32.910 --> 04:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
job uh less difficult and that that
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
might be a good thing
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
so with that thank you well we do have a
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
question representative sh sh
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for a question so as I understand
 
04:54:46.990 --> 04:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
in the Healthcare System I have seen
 
04:54:50.310 --> 04:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
three different kind of charges one
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
charge for the service and then what
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
second is the charges that insurance
 
04:54:57.150 --> 04:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
company pays for that service that's
 
04:55:00.110 --> 04:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
different and then third kind of charge
 
04:55:02.590 --> 04:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
which somebody pays by cash so there are
 
04:55:05.470 --> 04:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
three kind of billing amounts for the
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
same service which charges are you
 
04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
referring here to publish well I I I
 
04:55:12.910 --> 04:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think cash would be part
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the data collection so I I would
 
04:55:18.788 --> 04:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
assume we eliminate that one um it it
 
04:55:20.590 --> 04:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
talks about negotiated rates so I think
 
04:55:22.948 --> 04:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
it would be you know whatever that rate
 
04:55:25.430 --> 04:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
would be insurance company as negotiated
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that the insurance company would
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
pay but again I'm not a super expert on
 
04:55:30.750 --> 04:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
this so maybe someone will will answer
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
that behind
 
04:55:35.910 --> 04:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
me okay I hold up Alex will answer that
 
04:55:35.920 --> 04:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
me okay I hold up Alex will answer that
question

04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:55:40.990 --> 04:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
also all right thank you very much chair
 
04:55:42.990 --> 04:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
we're calling Alex Fel from the New
 
04:55:46.830 --> 04:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
department and Jason okay we didn't
 
04:55:54.750 --> 04:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:04.948 --> 04:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:08.070 --> 04:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
in oh okay that sounds
 
04:56:11.708 --> 04:56:11.718 align:start position:0%
better um the essence of this Bill uh
 
04:56:24.510 --> 04:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:26.830 --> 04:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
testimony oh I'll introduce myself one
 
04:56:28.670 --> 04:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
more time I'm Alex
 
04:56:34.110 --> 04:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
Fel um what's my title um Health reform
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
instructor that's since I retired and
 
04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
came back that's what I'm about retired
 
04:56:42.510 --> 04:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:44.830 --> 04:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
um so the essence of this bill is that
 
04:56:49.390 --> 04:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
it codifies in state law the existing
 
04:56:52.030 --> 04:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
transparency and coverage Federal
 
04:56:54.110 --> 04:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
Regulation which requires health
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers to disclose on a
 
04:56:58.240 --> 04:56:59.190 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers to disclose on a
public

04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:57:02.948 --> 04:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
website number one the uh in network
 
04:57:06.628 --> 04:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
negotiated rates uh that they you know
 
04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
have contracted for within Network
 
04:57:11.590 --> 04:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
providers number number two they're out
 
04:57:14.350 --> 04:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
of network build charges and then the
 
04:57:17.470 --> 04:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
paid amount on those build charges and
 
04:57:19.868 --> 04:57:19.878 align:start position:0%
then number three the negotiated rate
 
04:57:22.030 --> 04:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
and historical net price for
 
04:57:22.040 --> 04:57:23.548 align:start position:0%
and historical net price for
prescription

04:57:23.548 --> 04:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
drugs um so it does
 
04:57:30.150 --> 04:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
um uh pretty much as representative
 
04:57:34.110 --> 04:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
Ammon described everything but the U
 
04:57:37.510 --> 04:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
uninsured cash
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
consumer this regulation was first
 
04:57:41.830 --> 04:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
promulgated in
 
04:57:44.670 --> 04:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
2020 uh in response to an executive
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
order from then president Trump in his
 
04:57:49.948 --> 04:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
first Administration and it was aimed at
 
04:57:52.628 --> 04:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
improving price and quality transparency
 
04:57:54.270 --> 04:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
in American Health
 
04:57:57.868 --> 04:57:57.878 align:start position:0%
Care the intent is to make information
 
04:58:00.830 --> 04:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
available to the public and thereby
 
04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
Drive Innovation and support inform
 
04:58:06.390 --> 04:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
price conscious decision making and
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
promote competition in the healthcare
 
04:58:08.760 --> 04:58:10.750 align:start position:0%
promote competition in the healthcare
industry

04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:58:13.350 --> 04:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
the regulation requires Health carriers
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
to make available to the public
 
04:58:18.910 --> 04:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
including stakeholders such as consumers
 
04:58:21.910 --> 04:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
researchers employers and third-party
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
developers three separate uh machine
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
readable files uh that means files
 
04:58:32.430 --> 04:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
posted on a website that can be read by
 
04:58:36.030 --> 04:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
a computer in a mechanized
 
04:58:40.350 --> 04:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
way um and
 
04:58:42.670 --> 04:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh as you know I just went through the
 
04:58:45.990 --> 04:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
three types of um price information
 
04:58:48.270 --> 04:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
there has to be three machine readable
 
04:58:51.470 --> 04:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
files that are posted so the carriers
 
04:58:54.390 --> 04:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
are doing this um
 
04:58:59.070 --> 04:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
today um they are uh posting the
 
04:59:04.948 --> 04:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
information um but they are doing it um
 
04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
in different uh formats and different
 
04:59:11.150 --> 04:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
styles of present
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
ation um which has in most part had the
 
04:59:19.030 --> 04:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
effect of making that
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
information not very useful to
 
04:59:26.470 --> 04:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
researchers or to uh innovators who for
 
04:59:30.830 --> 04:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
example might want to create a shopper
 
04:59:33.150 --> 04:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
Tool uh similar to what the insurance
 
04:59:35.510 --> 04:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
department has created in its Health
 
04:59:39.590 --> 04:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
cost website where you can go and put in
 
04:59:41.548 --> 04:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
the information who your health carrier
 
04:59:44.190 --> 04:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
is what kind of procedure you're
 
04:59:47.868 --> 04:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
contemplated and get the price uh for
 
04:59:49.590 --> 04:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:59:54.390 --> 04:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
procedure um none of that has happened
 
04:59:57.030 --> 04:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh which was the intent of the Federal
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
Regulation uh because of the differing
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
format uh in in which it's presented and
 
05:00:06.708 --> 05:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
Jason will give you some more specific
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
examples of that
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
problem this bill addresses that problem
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
simply by taking the Federal
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
Regulation codifying it
 
05:00:20.310 --> 05:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
verbatim in state law without adding any
 
05:00:23.390 --> 05:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
requirements to it with the sole
 
05:00:26.590 --> 05:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
difference uh which is on page bottom of
 
05:00:29.628 --> 05:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
page four and the top of page five in
 
05:00:33.948 --> 05:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
the bill and that provision gives the
 
05:00:37.390 --> 05:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner the authority to
 
05:00:41.750 --> 05:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
um promate a rule setting one standard
 
05:00:44.670 --> 05:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
format for providing the information so
 
05:00:46.190 --> 05:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
that all the healthc cares will be
 
05:00:50.310 --> 05:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
providing it in the same format and then
 
05:00:51.788 --> 05:00:51.798 align:start position:0%
it will be
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
usable to researchers to the insurance
 
05:00:58.270 --> 05:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
department to uh
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
consumers and um this is something that
 
05:01:04.110 --> 05:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
this kind of conclusion and plan is
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
something that came out of some work
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department did over
 
05:01:12.030 --> 05:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
the summer under a Federal grant uh
 
05:01:14.750 --> 05:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
which was intended to help us improve
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
our health care uh price transparency
 
05:01:21.510 --> 05:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
efforts and so we were able to hire
 
05:01:24.750 --> 05:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
manat to come in and advise us and one
 
05:01:26.910 --> 05:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
of the things we wanted to know is how
 
05:01:30.030 --> 05:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
can we make use of the new federally
 
05:01:32.430 --> 05:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
required transparency and coverage
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
information and their answer to us is
 
05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
well you can't because it's the the rule
 
05:01:43.110 --> 05:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't require enough specificity in
 
05:01:45.628 --> 05:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
the way that the information is
 
05:01:48.150 --> 05:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
provided um and they suggested we look
 
05:01:51.788 --> 05:01:51.798 align:start position:0%
to some other states which are um have
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
already taken steps to do what this bill
 
05:01:57.430 --> 05:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
does which is to codify the federal Rule
 
05:02:00.868 --> 05:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
and then get more specific about the
 
05:02:04.230 --> 05:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
format in which the data has to be
 
05:02:07.868 --> 05:02:07.878 align:start position:0%
presented um so we've uh distributed
 
05:02:10.910 --> 05:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation to the carrier
 
05:02:15.788 --> 05:02:15.798 align:start position:0%
um and we have um received just recently
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
um some feedback that they're concerned
 
05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
about uh potential cost to them of um
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
changing the format in which this data
 
05:02:27.030 --> 05:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
05:02:29.230 --> 05:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
provided um so I'd like
 
05:02:33.510 --> 05:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
to ask um Jason at this point to speak
 
05:02:37.788 --> 05:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
to the these two kind of crucial
 
05:02:40.270 --> 05:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
developments under the federal rule Ru
 
05:02:43.628 --> 05:02:43.638 align:start position:0%
that the information why it's not that
 
05:02:46.990 --> 05:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
useful and why we think uh it wouldn't
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:54.830 --> 05:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
proposes thank you Alex for the record
 
05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
Jason AES director of Health economics
 
05:02:59.708 --> 05:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
at the insurance department I see almost
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
everybody here knows Alex's name and
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
despite that he struggled telling you
 
05:03:06.350 --> 05:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
what his title is for the record I call
 
05:03:09.270 --> 05:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
him FDC former Deputy Commissioner of
 
05:03:11.230 --> 05:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
the insurance department so henceforth
 
05:03:13.948 --> 05:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
you shall be known as such um thank you
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
for your time and hearing this important
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill I just wanted to Echo
 
05:03:19.390 --> 05:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
representative amon's closing statement
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
about efficiencies in economies because
 
05:03:23.708 --> 05:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
I think we're we're I'm always very
 
05:03:25.750 --> 05:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive to not incur additional or
 
05:03:27.990 --> 05:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
superimposed costs to our private
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that perform important
 
05:03:32.390 --> 05:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
services to our citizenry and I too
 
05:03:34.310 --> 05:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
believe like he does that this might
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
make the process of transparency in
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
complying with Federal rules actually
 
05:03:41.470 --> 05:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
more efficient and that's really that
 
05:03:42.990 --> 05:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
weighed heavily on us in in the
 
05:03:45.948 --> 05:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
synthesis of this bill um that we worked
 
05:03:48.430 --> 05:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
hard on so I think I don't want anybody
 
05:03:50.670 --> 05:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
to lose sight of that that's important
 
05:03:52.590 --> 05:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the mechanics of it
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
there are three machine readable files
 
05:03:57.150 --> 05:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
that we've specified in the formatting
 
05:03:58.990 --> 05:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
requirement the federal rule does the
 
05:04:01.510 --> 05:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
same although we see very spurious
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
compliance across the Continuum of of of
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
carriers submitting data it's it's not
 
05:04:09.150 --> 05:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
to say that they're non-compliant it's
 
05:04:10.548 --> 05:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
that they Cho choose different
 
05:04:13.150 --> 05:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
formatting Styles and as a result it's
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
quite chaotic heterogeneous and and
 
05:04:18.430 --> 05:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
really of low utility to the users like
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
State regulators and even consumers it's
 
05:04:23.070 --> 05:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
it's noteworthy too that the federal
 
05:04:25.470 --> 05:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
rule requires that insurers post on
 
05:04:29.230 --> 05:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
their website a consumer friendly um
 
05:04:33.070 --> 05:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
file for which consumers can um or or or
 
05:04:35.590 --> 05:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
application for which consumers can go
 
05:04:37.830 --> 05:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
and get price estimates on their own
 
05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
these machine readable files don't
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
coincide with that intent rather they're
 
05:04:45.030 --> 05:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
more for analysts people who have the
 
05:04:48.270 --> 05:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
the resources both um physical and
 
05:04:50.230 --> 05:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
intellectual resources to be able to
 
05:04:53.350 --> 05:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
handle large data sets and complex
 
05:04:56.670 --> 05:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
health care cost data and the latter is
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
what this bill aims to um improve upon
 
05:05:02.430 --> 05:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
and the three machine readable files are
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
systematically organized like that for
 
05:05:07.390 --> 05:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
the reasons that um the representative
 
05:05:09.910 --> 05:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
to my left brought up and in
 
05:05:11.548 --> 05:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
representative melair about this
 
05:05:14.670 --> 05:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
variation in prices so notably you you
 
05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see in network negotiated rates
 
05:05:20.270 --> 05:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
for those providers who are in contract
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
with carriers they'll have a specified
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
rate and it's listed by procedure code
 
05:05:29.590 --> 05:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's our vernacular for how much did
 
05:05:32.190 --> 05:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
it cost for the procedure that I had
 
05:05:35.150 --> 05:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's an important regulatory tool for
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
us in the insurance department the
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
second file is out of network allowed
 
05:05:43.390 --> 05:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
amounts which not all providers in our
 
05:05:45.310 --> 05:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
healthc care system are in network with
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
insurers so for that purpose there's
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
Merit in understanding how much those
 
05:05:55.350 --> 05:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
Services um are charged for by out of
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
network providers and what the paid
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
amounts are and then the third file is
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
essentially a prescription drug file and
 
05:06:03.750 --> 05:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
I don't have to tell anybody on this
 
05:06:05.788 --> 05:06:05.798 align:start position:0%
committee the importance of prescription
 
05:06:08.510 --> 05:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
drug price transparency and it uses a
 
05:06:10.390 --> 05:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
slightly different by really interesting
 
05:06:13.350 --> 05:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
and effective methodology to get
 
05:06:16.030 --> 05:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
reference data for that information so
 
05:06:18.510 --> 05:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
we believe that this is really um a
 
05:06:20.708 --> 05:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
sensitive approach to improving our
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
important price transparency efforts and
 
05:06:25.270 --> 05:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's a big part of the work that we do
 
05:06:27.230 --> 05:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
and um I thank you for hearing that
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
long- winded story and I welcome any
 
05:06:35.230 --> 05:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:38.430 --> 05:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
spear excuse me yeah I didn't have my
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
hand up but
 
05:06:43.868 --> 05:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we're we we're easily
 
05:06:46.110 --> 05:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
confused thanks for taking my question I
 
05:06:48.350 --> 05:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
just need clarification of something um
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
on page two section two do all all do
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
all the in network provider are all the
 
05:06:59.910 --> 05:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:03.430 --> 05:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
uniform no no that's the that's really
 
05:07:05.390 --> 05:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and that's one
 
05:07:08.110 --> 05:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
of the best utilities of it to see price
 
05:07:10.590 --> 05:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
variation across a contain Continuum of
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
providers and there there is indeed much
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
you know many of you may know of our New
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health cost website we do much
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
to try to stabilize that price variation
 
05:07:25.510 --> 05:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
by provider and and by carrier that we
 
05:07:28.470 --> 05:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
communicate to the citizenry into
 
05:07:30.868 --> 05:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
purchases and anybody else interested
 
05:07:34.430 --> 05:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
and it is indeed quite a task so price
 
05:07:36.030 --> 05:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
variability is one of the main
 
05:07:38.990 --> 05:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
overarching issues for these you know
 
05:07:39.000 --> 05:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
overarching issues for these you know
robust

05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
robust
 
05:07:43.510 --> 05:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
05:07:54.750 --> 05:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
sharesa uh
 
05:07:59.190 --> 05:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
so so uh my question is that uh if I
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
have certain insurance I do get the
 
05:08:04.230 --> 05:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
price that the insurance going to pay
 
05:08:08.510 --> 05:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
for that service so does this bill
 
05:08:11.830 --> 05:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
basically work on getting those prices
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
available to all the public not the
 
05:08:15.628 --> 05:08:15.638 align:start position:0%
person who is having that insurance is
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
is my understanding correct both I mean
 
05:08:20.070 --> 05:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
the the consumer friendly file is
 
05:08:23.470 --> 05:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
intended and by by federal law the CER
 
05:08:26.948 --> 05:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
is required to give you precise cost
 
05:08:29.110 --> 05:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
estimates for a procedure at any given
 
05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
provider that they're in network for and
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
I'll let Alex say say more on that yeah
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
the intent is both to um give the
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
covered person access to to information
 
05:08:42.430 --> 05:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
about the price that's been negotiated
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
for the service that that person is
 
05:08:48.910 --> 05:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
contemplating having and also for
 
05:08:50.830 --> 05:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
example large employers might be
 
05:08:54.190 --> 05:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
interested in comparing the negotiated
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
rates from one carrier to another to
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
determine what would be the cost of
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
Contracting with this carrier versus
 
05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
this carrier for the same coverage
 
05:09:07.788 --> 05:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
because it'll vary just to follow up F
 
05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
the question mequ
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
so uh so I just want to clarify myself
 
05:09:14.750 --> 05:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
that so the information that you're
 
05:09:18.030 --> 05:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
talking about cost of procedure paid by
 
05:09:19.948 --> 05:09:19.958 align:start position:0%
the insurance that's already available
 
05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
to me being a you know having that if I
 
05:09:26.110 --> 05:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
have that insurance what is this going
 
05:09:28.590 --> 05:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
to do ex additional is it is it saying
 
05:09:30.510 --> 05:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
that that number should be available to
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
everybody even if that person doesn't
 
05:09:35.948 --> 05:09:35.958 align:start position:0%
have that insurance well the actual
 
05:09:39.390 --> 05:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
price of that information is not today
 
05:09:41.230 --> 05:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
easily available to you even as a
 
05:09:41.240 --> 05:09:43.628 align:start position:0%
easily available to you even as a
covered

05:09:43.628 --> 05:09:43.638 align:start position:0%
covered
 
05:09:47.948 --> 05:09:47.958 align:start position:0%
person it is further question question
 
05:09:51.030 --> 05:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
no that before the procedure when I do
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
get that in the statement that this is
 
05:09:55.390 --> 05:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
how much the insurance going to cover
 
05:09:58.350 --> 05:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
the cost the cost this is the cost from
 
05:10:00.590 --> 05:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance that is going to cover for
 
05:10:02.510 --> 05:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
that procedure I do get that in in the
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
statement yeah we're um getting
 
05:10:10.750 --> 05:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh crossed here crossed up on the
 
05:10:12.548 --> 05:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
distinction between the cost sharing
 
05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
that you can get access to that
 
05:10:18.190 --> 05:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
information how much it'll cost you the
 
05:10:21.510 --> 05:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
consumer versus the actual price that
 
05:10:23.548 --> 05:10:23.558 align:start position:0%
gets paid for that
 
05:10:27.430 --> 05:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
service followup further question no I
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
do get the both I I get how much the
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
insurance is going to pay for their
 
05:10:34.270 --> 05:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
service and how much my portion would be
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
I get both the information for that
 
05:10:39.708 --> 05:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
procedure from the insurance that I have
 
05:10:41.670 --> 05:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
is this bill going to so my question was
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
that that information is already coming
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
to me from the insurance that I have but
 
05:10:47.750 --> 05:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
is it does this bill say that I should
 
05:10:49.150 --> 05:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
have the information from the all the
 
05:10:51.470 --> 05:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
other insurance company also for for
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
that procedure that I don't have yeah
 
05:10:56.670 --> 05:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
you could compare like um I know I'm
 
05:11:00.070 --> 05:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
going to have this procedure and I'd
 
05:11:03.868 --> 05:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
like to know what it would cost um
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
through this coverage versus this other
 
05:11:07.390 --> 05:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
coverage and you could find that
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
information thank you
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay re thank thank you for letting me
 
05:11:16.590 --> 05:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
ask a question thank you for U
 
05:11:18.548 --> 05:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill
 
05:11:22.390 --> 05:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
so is it fair to say that this bill is
 
05:11:25.948 --> 05:11:25.958 align:start position:0%
really a specification to the IT
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
department to say you have all this data
 
05:11:32.190 --> 05:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
and here is how it needs to be presented
 
05:11:35.390 --> 05:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
in these files so that you so that we
 
05:11:39.030 --> 05:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
can have ai look at it and solve all of
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
our are you know questions so is it
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
really the specification part of how to
 
05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
present the data that you already have
 
05:11:50.470 --> 05:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
in a common format and then let AI take
 
05:11:52.830 --> 05:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
over thank you for your thoughtful
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
question I would probably say let ja and
 
05:11:58.430 --> 05:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
MPH take over those are my initials and
 
05:12:01.510 --> 05:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
Morgan harrises not for AI because I
 
05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
like many of your colleagues here
 
05:12:06.510 --> 05:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the ambiguity of that
 
05:12:08.430 --> 05:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
and the uncontrollability and
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
untenability ability of that we we as
 
05:12:13.548 --> 05:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
Regulators often get calls at the
 
05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
insurance department through our
 
05:12:16.310 --> 05:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
consumer services division about
 
05:12:18.830 --> 05:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
patients getting Expo facto after
 
05:12:22.390 --> 05:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
they've had the service um they were
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
unaware of the price that they might pay
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
so we do much to try to give our
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
citizens our priority information over
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
what the price is and it turns out to
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative maier's comments I mean
 
05:12:38.470 --> 05:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's very spous and cryptic actually
 
05:12:41.470 --> 05:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of us specifying this a
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
naal more
 
05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
standard homogeneous format across the
 
05:12:48.990 --> 05:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
Continuum of carriers that we regulate
 
05:12:51.110 --> 05:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
is so that we can do a better job in
 
05:12:53.670 --> 05:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
reporting that outward and then also
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
reconciling disparities when we do
 
05:12:57.868 --> 05:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
indeed get consumer complaints which is
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
often on why they paid this amount when
 
05:13:02.430 --> 05:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
they thought it was going to be another
 
05:13:05.708 --> 05:13:05.718 align:start position:0%
amount and often times it's it's a an
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Education rather than
 
05:13:09.750 --> 05:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
non-compliance on the insurance part
 
05:13:12.788 --> 05:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
it's th this can be very challenging at
 
05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
the consumer level to find out what
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
procedure code actually applied to the
 
05:13:21.430 --> 05:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
service someone had not you know um
 
05:13:23.830 --> 05:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
there can be a blood draw for lipids and
 
05:13:25.590 --> 05:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
there's about 40 different procedure
 
05:13:28.350 --> 05:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
codes just for that something so simple
 
05:13:30.910 --> 05:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
from a billing in in in reimbursement
 
05:13:34.750 --> 05:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint is actually very complex and
 
05:13:37.350 --> 05:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
and we you know we I often times
 
05:13:40.110 --> 05:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
struggle considering the Merit of the
 
05:13:42.548 --> 05:13:42.558 align:start position:0%
federal rule requiring that insurers put
 
05:13:44.830 --> 05:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
the consumer friendly format there
 
05:13:46.670 --> 05:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
because it's somewhat of a
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
misnomer because the number one mistake
 
05:13:51.390 --> 05:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
consumers make is not having the right
 
05:13:53.868 --> 05:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
procedure code and or being able to
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
figure out among the the the host of
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
procedure codes listed when you type in
 
05:14:02.270 --> 05:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
lipid profile which one did I have and
 
05:14:04.548 --> 05:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
it's not fair to providers who do great
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
work hospitals who provide a lot of
 
05:14:10.548 --> 05:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
services and carriers is who finance it
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
for all of that Enigma to exist and so
 
05:14:16.190 --> 05:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
to that end we take our responsibility
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
to communicate these rates in an
 
05:14:21.190 --> 05:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
interpretable way very seriously so
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
that's a very thoughtful question I just
 
05:14:24.788 --> 05:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know respond in that
 
05:14:26.708 --> 05:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
tongue and cheek fashion about AI but
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
also make it clear that you have two
 
05:14:31.590 --> 05:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
data analysts working extensively to
 
05:14:33.628 --> 05:14:33.638 align:start position:0%
ensure the Fidelity of the outward
 
05:14:35.910 --> 05:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
facing nature of these important
 
05:14:35.920 --> 05:14:36.910 align:start position:0%
facing nature of these important
Healthcare

05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
Healthcare
 
05:14:41.470 --> 05:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:46.230 --> 05:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:51.070 --> 05:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.110 --> 05:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh who should we start with first today
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:12.510 --> 05:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:15:15.868 --> 05:15:15.878 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record again Peter
 
05:15:17.470 --> 05:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
bragon representing Harvard Pilgrim
 
05:15:19.310 --> 05:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
Healthcare the state's not for-profit
 
05:15:22.190 --> 05:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
health insurance company and uh yes once
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
again I didn't put support or oppose I
 
05:15:25.470 --> 05:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
just put that we do have some concerns
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
and we do um the intent here is great in
 
05:15:30.830 --> 05:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
fact uh something we support
 
05:15:33.150 --> 05:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
transparency uh there is a federal
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
program that exists we already do this
 
05:15:40.030 --> 05:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
um and so um the concern we have and I I
 
05:15:43.030 --> 05:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
guess I have to correct the
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
FD uh C the former Deputy Commissioner
 
05:15:48.310 --> 05:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh who said the the department just
 
05:15:50.990 --> 05:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
recently received followup from the
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
carriers um in SE end of September the
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
carriers were sent a draft of this and
 
05:15:57.910 --> 05:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
October 10th the carriers responded
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
saying we're concerned we got some
 
05:16:01.548 --> 05:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
problems and then we never heard back
 
05:16:03.708 --> 05:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department so we have
 
05:16:05.788 --> 05:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
some major concerns uh and to say it
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
just recently came up I think is a is a
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
an understate stat uh we do support the
 
05:16:12.948 --> 05:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
concept of transparency uh we are
 
05:16:14.910 --> 05:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
already doing this uh as was noted
 
05:16:16.750 --> 05:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
there's a federal law that requires
 
05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
these big data files to be submitted and
 
05:16:21.310 --> 05:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
by the way this is not something for
 
05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
consumers uh each of these files that is
 
05:16:26.430 --> 05:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
submitted and there's not three uh each
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
of these files that's submitted is I
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
believe uh three and a half gigabytes in
 
05:16:36.270 --> 05:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
size so uh Joe consumer uh at his laptop
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
with his notepad app um I can't even
 
05:16:40.750 --> 05:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
read these files it's just too big for
 
05:16:43.708 --> 05:16:43.718 align:start position:0%
anything that I have um and the carriers
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
including har Pilgrim has spent a lot of
 
05:16:48.190 --> 05:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
time effort money and resources putting
 
05:16:49.590 --> 05:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
these files together and one of the
 
05:16:51.868 --> 05:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
problems we have is the overall testing
 
05:16:52.990 --> 05:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
of it and everything else because the
 
05:16:54.788 --> 05:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
files are so big you just can't pull it
 
05:16:57.708 --> 05:16:57.718 align:start position:0%
up in anything normal um but the scale
 
05:17:01.470 --> 05:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
of let me say there are three three file
 
05:17:03.150 --> 05:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
types that have to be done one for in
 
05:17:05.230 --> 05:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
network one for out of network and one
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
for prescription drug okay that's fine
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
that sounds like three uh that has to be
 
05:17:12.430 --> 05:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
done for every single plan so in New
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I looked at the Harvard's
 
05:17:16.910 --> 05:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh transparency site where these files
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
are uh for New Hampshire I counted at
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
least 24 of these plans that we have in
 
05:17:23.150 --> 05:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for all the different
 
05:17:25.390 --> 05:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
things that we do um and then for each
 
05:17:28.548 --> 05:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
of these files uh it consists of uh for
 
05:17:30.788 --> 05:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
each of the 24 plans then there has to
 
05:17:33.070 --> 05:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
be a record for each billing code for
 
05:17:34.948 --> 05:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
every procedure of which there are
 
05:17:37.750 --> 05:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
thousands uh and then the rates we
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
charge for those procedures for that um
 
05:17:44.350 --> 05:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
provider of which there are hundreds so
 
05:17:46.430 --> 05:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
you have basically a data set that is
 
05:17:48.190 --> 05:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
thousands of Records times hundreds of
 
05:17:51.310 --> 05:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
records for providers uh times only 24
 
05:17:52.868 --> 05:17:52.878 align:start position:0%
plans for us I can't imagine how many
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
some of the other carriers have uh and
 
05:17:56.830 --> 05:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
you end up with gigantic files so
 
05:17:59.590 --> 05:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
basically we have 24 files Each of which
 
05:18:02.548 --> 05:18:02.558 align:start position:0%
are about 3 and a half gigabytes in size
 
05:18:04.670 --> 05:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
Each of which has to be recreated every
 
05:18:06.590 --> 05:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
month uh the one for the Auto Network
 
05:18:08.470 --> 05:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
rates if I understand it correctly has
 
05:18:10.430 --> 05:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
to include the prices every price paid
 
05:18:12.548 --> 05:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
for a procedure within the last I think
 
05:18:15.628 --> 05:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
60 or 90 days to every single
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
provider these are gigantic it took us a
 
05:18:21.030 --> 05:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
long time and a lot of effort to create
 
05:18:23.750 --> 05:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
them and our concern is and the
 
05:18:25.750 --> 05:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
testimony you heard is correct for the
 
05:18:28.548 --> 05:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
most part what's specified here mimics
 
05:18:30.190 --> 05:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
what the federal transparency law
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
requires in terms of what's supposed to
 
05:18:33.788 --> 05:18:33.798 align:start position:0%
be in there uh however the thing that
 
05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
concerns us the most is the piece at the
 
05:18:37.830 --> 05:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
end uh I think it's at the end that
 
05:18:40.470 --> 05:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
basically allows the commissioner to say
 
05:18:41.830 --> 05:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay this is what the format's going to
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
be uh this is not something you can just
 
05:18:47.788 --> 05:18:47.798 align:start position:0%
flip on its side now if the uh
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
department wants to make something that
 
05:18:52.350 --> 05:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
goes in and looks at these files and
 
05:18:54.548 --> 05:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
takes out the data that it wants okay
 
05:18:56.230 --> 05:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
fine and I I understand from the
 
05:18:58.990 --> 05:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh the federal data
 
05:19:01.030 --> 05:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
specifications were not that exacting
 
05:19:03.070 --> 05:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
and so people are doing different things
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh so maybe there's something we can
 
05:19:06.430 --> 05:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
work on there but I guess uh to
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
summarize it we're very concerned the
 
05:19:10.750 --> 05:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
scope and the scale of this is gigantic
 
05:19:13.230 --> 05:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
we're a small Regional not for-profit
 
05:19:16.230 --> 05:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
health insurance company uh a lot of
 
05:19:18.310 --> 05:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
time effort and expense has gone into
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
making this to comply with the federal
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
laws um and rather than changing the
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
spec so we have to have a different
 
05:19:28.548 --> 05:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
format for New Hampshire uh you know
 
05:19:29.948 --> 05:19:29.958 align:start position:0%
Maine's going to want a different format
 
05:19:31.150 --> 05:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
mass is going to want a different format
 
05:19:32.070 --> 05:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
rhod Island's going to want a different
 
05:19:34.750 --> 05:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
format uh and again every 30 days we
 
05:19:37.030 --> 05:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
have to generate these things so uh this
 
05:19:39.150 --> 05:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
is not something simple and uh there's
 
05:19:40.590 --> 05:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
got to be a better way I think that
 
05:19:42.190 --> 05:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
would probably wrap up my comments and
 
05:19:44.548 --> 05:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
 
05:19:47.470 --> 05:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much anybody have

bill obviously chairman members of the
 
05:20:07.628 --> 05:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
OB first born I'm on oh excuse
 
05:20:10.470 --> 05:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
me I'm representing ahip with America's
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
health insurance plans which is a trade
 
05:20:13.868 --> 05:20:13.878 align:start position:0%
Association and I've heard one of my
 
05:20:16.230 --> 05:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
member companies give forth with great
 
05:20:19.230 --> 05:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
strength I have confusion because I sort
 
05:20:22.590 --> 05:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
of come to this late um I did not get
 
05:20:24.670 --> 05:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
notice back in October that something
 
05:20:26.990 --> 05:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
was a fly and I sort of took on this
 
05:20:29.430 --> 05:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
present task on January 1st so I had to
 
05:20:32.510 --> 05:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
do some homework and what I understood
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
or understand or think I understand is
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
that what is going on is the
 
05:20:38.788 --> 05:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
Department's well aware as many of the
 
05:20:41.030 --> 05:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
plans are of their obligations at the
 
05:20:43.948 --> 05:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
federal level for both plans and
 
05:20:46.510 --> 05:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals as well to file immense
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
amounts of data I think it's under the
 
05:20:51.990 --> 05:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
high-tech Act and the outcome of that
 
05:20:55.628 --> 05:20:55.638 align:start position:0%
has been somewhat anemic a lot of
 
05:20:58.270 --> 05:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
confusion I guess the hospitals filings
 
05:21:01.030 --> 05:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
are sort of less comprehensible than the
 
05:21:04.030 --> 05:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
pl filings but they're not easy files to
 
05:21:07.390 --> 05:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
work with uh when I first saw the bill I
 
05:21:09.430 --> 05:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
thought well I guess what trying to do
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
is have the local plans that filed
 
05:21:15.190 --> 05:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
federally just import that information
 
05:21:17.350 --> 05:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
and give it to the insurance
 
05:21:19.590 --> 05:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
department which would be pretty
 
05:21:22.590 --> 05:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
Monumental in and of itself but what I
 
05:21:24.190 --> 05:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
understand and this is the missing piece
 
05:21:26.708 --> 05:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
for me and I think we could have more
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Department to
 
05:21:32.590 --> 05:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
understand it is that the intention is
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
to look at the federal format and say
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
well for State purposes we need to alter
 
05:21:41.910 --> 05:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
that format in some capacity so we don't
 
05:21:43.628 --> 05:21:43.638 align:start position:0%
yet know what that would be it would
 
05:21:46.548 --> 05:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
come through rul making so I think
 
05:21:48.510 --> 05:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
that's a discussion that needs to be had
 
05:21:49.948 --> 05:21:49.958 align:start position:0%
and plans are ready to have that
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
discussion with the department and so
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
for the moment I'm signed up some I sort
 
05:21:58.270 --> 05:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
of in between I'm more leaning toward
 
05:22:01.150 --> 05:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
direct opposition because this time at
 
05:22:04.470 --> 05:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
this card so anyway so there it is and I
 
05:22:06.548 --> 05:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
feel sort of totally unequipped to
 
05:22:08.910 --> 05:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
answer any technical questions but there
 
05:22:11.070 --> 05:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
is a lot of puzzlement I understand data
 
05:22:12.948 --> 05:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
is important and it's certainly
 
05:22:15.390 --> 05:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
important for policy makers like you we
 
05:22:17.910 --> 05:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
have hopes that consumers will use
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
complex data and learn and model their
 
05:22:22.670 --> 05:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
ways to save money and go to the right
 
05:22:24.750 --> 05:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
people the reality is the consumer
 
05:22:26.670 --> 05:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
uptake on this kind of information is
 
05:22:29.350 --> 05:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
yet to be compelling to them so we have
 
05:22:31.350 --> 05:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of work to do so anyway I'm
 
05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
willing to along with my plans have
 
05:22:35.708 --> 05:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
further discussions and as I said I'd be
 
05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions but I
 
05:22:41.788 --> 05:22:41.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:45.230 --> 05:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
to representative mcair uh thank you
 
05:22:47.230 --> 05:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I I
 
05:22:50.110 --> 05:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
guess I don't understand why the states
 
05:22:53.548 --> 05:22:53.558 align:start position:0%
can't do this information in the same
 
05:22:55.750 --> 05:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
format that the federal government
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that make it easier for
 
05:22:58.510 --> 05:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
everybody well the information is
 
05:23:00.670 --> 05:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
available to anybody federally any one
 
05:23:02.750 --> 05:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
of you could go and access it if you
 
05:23:04.510 --> 05:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to so and the insurance
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
department can do that some states have
 
05:23:10.270 --> 05:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
made sort of efforts as New Hampshire
 
05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
insurance department is doing in good
 
05:23:14.670 --> 05:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
faith to see how that data up there
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
might have meaning for their
 
05:23:20.070 --> 05:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
constituency and so the plans are the
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
reporting people and they need to
 
05:23:24.990 --> 05:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what that is all
 
05:23:26.470 --> 05:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
about because the department would
 
05:23:28.788 --> 05:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
assure us that there is utility to that
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
data and we need to understand the
 
05:23:34.350 --> 05:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
format and so it's it makes us very
 
05:23:36.030 --> 05:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable and that's why we're
 
05:23:38.110 --> 05:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill in its present form
 
05:23:38.120 --> 05:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill in its present form
okay

05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
Alex do you mind coming
 
05:23:48.548 --> 05:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:51.670 --> 05:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
you I have let me ask my question and
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
then you can ask
 
05:23:57.990 --> 05:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
yours I assume you all
 
05:24:01.868 --> 05:24:01.878 align:start position:0%
be okay so The $64,000 Question
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
is what's what is being reported to the
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
Feds that is not is not helpful or
 
05:24:11.150 --> 05:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
useful or what what are you looking for
 
05:24:12.628 --> 05:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
that you're not getting that's from the
 
05:24:14.948 --> 05:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
feds and wouldn't it just be easier that
 
05:24:16.750 --> 05:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they submit to the feds they
 
05:24:21.628 --> 05:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
submit a copy to you and called us a day
 
05:24:25.628 --> 05:24:25.638 align:start position:0%
well the the main problem is what gets
 
05:24:30.750 --> 05:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
posted and publicly available is not in
 
05:24:34.430 --> 05:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
um any uniform format so that be let me
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
rephrase my question what is the wrong
 
05:24:39.230 --> 05:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
with whatever
 
05:24:40.948 --> 05:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
they are sending to the
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
feds which is different from what the
 
05:24:45.590 --> 05:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
federal government is posting right
 
05:24:47.110 --> 05:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
because Federal government's putting it
 
05:24:50.150 --> 05:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
through its word procer it's cruncher
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
and doing some other funky things with
 
05:24:54.948 --> 05:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
it so whatever they're
 
05:24:58.110 --> 05:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
sending they're sending the same
 
05:25:00.990 --> 05:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
information to you yeah and then you can
 
05:25:02.510 --> 05:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
take and do whatever you want with it
 
05:25:05.070 --> 05:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
that's the underlying intent is to
 
05:25:07.910 --> 05:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
result right where you finish but the
 
05:25:10.990 --> 05:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
Federal government stopped short of
 
05:25:13.548 --> 05:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
exactly specifying the format for
 
05:25:15.628 --> 05:25:15.638 align:start position:0%
carriers to submit them so they gave two
 
05:25:18.310 --> 05:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
options submit them in Json forms which
 
05:25:21.470 --> 05:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
are internet style JavaScript not
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
notation or HTML files and in those
 
05:25:29.948 --> 05:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
cases carriers are are to put um a
 
05:25:32.150 --> 05:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
directory essentially a map on how it's
 
05:25:35.670 --> 05:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
nested a as a result of not being very
 
05:25:38.430 --> 05:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
exact or clear on the specification form
 
05:25:41.150 --> 05:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
that across the carriers in our state
 
05:25:43.548 --> 05:25:43.558 align:start position:0%
that we regulate you like you heard
 
05:25:45.868 --> 05:25:45.878 align:start position:0%
Peter and they they were very compliant
 
05:25:48.670 --> 05:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
but the way that they submitted was for
 
05:25:51.310 --> 05:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
each plan a separate file for each plan
 
05:25:54.750 --> 05:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
whereas other carriers have all of the
 
05:25:56.190 --> 05:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
plans that they
 
05:26:00.310 --> 05:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
offer in one file in in a very very
 
05:26:00.320 --> 05:26:01.990 align:start position:0%
offer in one file in in a very very
complex

05:26:01.990 --> 05:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
complex
 
05:26:07.788 --> 05:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
Network and a third carrier has a the
 
05:26:10.910 --> 05:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
file organize in a way that there's
 
05:26:13.670 --> 05:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
hundreds of columns that are really
 
05:26:15.990 --> 05:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and none of them are
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
nefarious and of themselves it's just a
 
05:26:21.350 --> 05:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
non-standard format and taken together
 
05:26:24.830 --> 05:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
it renders the files not very useful so
 
05:26:27.070 --> 05:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
when we worked on this our imagination
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
was to take the reported variables that
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
as um representative Ammon said are well
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
specified on each line in in the statute
 
05:26:39.030 --> 05:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
and require them to just submit a CSV
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
file it's a it's
 
05:26:43.910 --> 05:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
a a glorified type of Excel file that
 
05:26:46.390 --> 05:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
has just that information with regards
 
05:26:48.750 --> 05:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
to the breadth of the content and
 
05:26:52.590 --> 05:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
information for prices I'll just um in
 
05:26:54.590 --> 05:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
the interest of not challenging Mr Bron
 
05:26:57.590 --> 05:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
I would just point out to everybody who
 
05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
goes to a supermarket that the average
 
05:27:03.070 --> 05:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
supermarket has about 160 to 180,000
 
05:27:05.190 --> 05:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
products that are individually priced
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
and they seem to do a decent enough job
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
keeping track of them and we as a
 
05:27:10.628 --> 05:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
society seem to think it's pretty
 
05:27:12.670 --> 05:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
important to know what the price of milk
 
05:27:15.230 --> 05:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
eggs butter bread and cigarettes if you
 
05:27:17.708 --> 05:27:17.718 align:start position:0%
buy them and I hope you don't but the
 
05:27:19.830 --> 05:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
the point being we we we have a price
 
05:27:22.030 --> 05:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
awareness of those things it's very
 
05:27:24.150 --> 05:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
complex but there are lots of examples
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
of how that's communicated to the
 
05:27:28.548 --> 05:27:28.558 align:start position:0%
consumer why shouldn't Healthcare be
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
like this this is an attempt to make
 
05:27:30.520 --> 05:27:32.230 align:start position:0%
like this this is an attempt to make
that

05:27:32.230 --> 05:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:37.390 --> 05:27:37.400 align:start position:0%
better so um Mr chairman um there was
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
something you said that uh gave me the
 
05:27:42.310 --> 05:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
impression that uh you're assuming this
 
05:27:44.470 --> 05:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
information gets filed with the federal
 
05:27:47.670 --> 05:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
government and it it doesn't the rule
 
05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
the Federal Regulation just tells each
 
05:27:53.670 --> 05:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
carrier to post this information on a
 
05:27:56.070 --> 05:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
website which is absolutely useless if
 
05:27:57.470 --> 05:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
every carrier is doing something
 
05:28:01.948 --> 05:28:01.958 align:start position:0%
different different right now
 
05:28:05.150 --> 05:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
um now there we can't make this up we
 
05:28:05.160 --> 05:28:06.628 align:start position:0%
um now there we can't make this up we
are

05:28:06.628 --> 05:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:28:09.788 --> 05:28:09.798 align:start position:0%
um in going to be in
 
05:28:11.868 --> 05:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
conversation okay with the carriers how
 
05:28:13.350 --> 05:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
about how about we have a statute that
 
05:28:14.948 --> 05:28:14.958 align:start position:0%
says that you will work with the
 
05:28:17.190 --> 05:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
carriers in New Hampshire so that we
 
05:28:20.910 --> 05:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
have a uniform system in New Hampshire
 
05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
without predetermining it at this point
 
05:28:26.788 --> 05:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
that we want you to try to work to come
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
together to have a
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
uniform methodology yeah something like
 
05:28:36.190 --> 05:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
what Paula suggested that how she first
 
05:28:38.670 --> 05:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
understood the bill it's an interesting
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
idea that we're going to follow up
 
05:28:41.120 --> 05:28:42.868 align:start position:0%
idea that we're going to follow up
on

05:28:42.868 --> 05:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:49.430 --> 05:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
spe realizing
 
05:28:52.750 --> 05:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
that realizing that the carriers are
 
05:28:55.628 --> 05:28:55.638 align:start position:0%
having a bit of an issue and realizing
 
05:28:57.868 --> 05:28:57.878 align:start position:0%
we have to get a certain place and
 
05:29:02.110 --> 05:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
realizing that their outputs are fixed
 
05:29:02.120 --> 05:29:03.110 align:start position:0%
realizing that their outputs are fixed
in

05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:29:05.548 --> 05:29:05.558 align:start position:0%
format and we'll eventually have an
 
05:29:07.230 --> 05:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
output you know the state will
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
eventually have a format that they want
 
05:29:12.670 --> 05:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
that's a problem in an
 
05:29:15.310 --> 05:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
algorithm it's not a problem of I have
 
05:29:17.830 --> 05:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
to reformat every piece of information
 
05:29:20.708 --> 05:29:20.718 align:start position:0%
that I have here it is an algorithm that
 
05:29:22.990 --> 05:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
can turn that thing into the format that
 
05:29:25.708 --> 05:29:25.718 align:start position:0%
we need so the question I ask is if we
 
05:29:27.670 --> 05:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
go along with the kind of thing that the
 
05:29:30.110 --> 05:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
chairman was talking about we could
 
05:29:32.310 --> 05:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
conceivably simplify this a little bit
 
05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
by them providing an algorithm to get us
 
05:29:36.628 --> 05:29:36.638 align:start position:0%
where we wanted to go once you have that
 
05:29:38.670 --> 05:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
decision as to an exact format we don't
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
have to convert everything that they
 
05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
have it can be an algorithmic result and
 
05:29:46.190 --> 05:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
an an algorithmic solution as oppos
 
05:29:48.590 --> 05:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
there if there's stuff combined I'm
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
sorry if there's some things combined
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter when if as long as it's
 
05:29:55.230 --> 05:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
fixed in format an algorithm can change
 
05:29:57.708 --> 05:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
it yeah but the algorithm won't know
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
what percentage of difference in between
 
05:30:02.470 --> 05:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
every every every provider would have to
 
05:30:04.590 --> 05:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
provide their algorithm but it's better
 
05:30:06.270 --> 05:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
than converting all the data might be a
 
05:30:09.750 --> 05:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
less it might be less
 
05:30:12.390 --> 05:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
impactful than trying to convert all
 
05:30:16.590 --> 05:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
that data every single time right it's
 
05:30:19.470 --> 05:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
essentially I'm going to call Paulo's
 
05:30:23.310 --> 05:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
idea um which is that each plan will
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
import the information and report it to
 
05:30:28.510 --> 05:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance department using you know
 
05:30:31.510 --> 05:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
a crosswalk or an algorithm um I don't
 
05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
know to give us the information we need
 
05:30:36.750 --> 05:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
well if the federal government is
 
05:30:39.990 --> 05:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
saying that just you can do any one of
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
these multiple different formats okay it
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then in New Hampshire we only have a
 
05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
handful of
 
05:30:52.670 --> 05:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
companies it seemed to me that now I can
 
05:30:55.150 --> 05:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
I can imagine we have some differentials
 
05:30:56.590 --> 05:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
because you know we have some big
 
05:30:58.948 --> 05:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
players and we have some little players
 
05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
so and I can only imagine that the way
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the feds did that is because some
 
05:31:05.910 --> 05:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
lobbyists were in the room that say well
 
05:31:07.750 --> 05:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
we can't do it that way or we need you
 
05:31:10.990 --> 05:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
to to do it our way and so then you got
 
05:31:13.470 --> 05:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
every every Lobby everyone wants to do
 
05:31:15.548 --> 05:31:15.558 align:start position:0%
it their own unique way and knowing full
 
05:31:17.070 --> 05:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
well that the information is now going
 
05:31:19.070 --> 05:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
to be useless to the consumer because
 
05:31:23.310 --> 05:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
they really can't compare and uh um not
 
05:31:25.270 --> 05:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm cynical about the legislative
 
05:31:27.910 --> 05:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
process but I sometimes I can see it
 
05:31:30.030 --> 05:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
happening right in front of me so I
 
05:31:32.948 --> 05:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
guess it would be yes it would be in a
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
perfect world that we could get you to
 
05:31:37.510 --> 05:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
do take the companies that are in New
 
05:31:37.520 --> 05:31:38.390 align:start position:0%
do take the companies that are in New
Hampshire

05:31:38.390 --> 05:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:31:40.948 --> 05:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
and to all have them agree to do it the
 
05:31:47.868 --> 05:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:51.708 --> 05:31:51.718 align:start position:0%
MH so we don't have that many companies
 
05:31:54.590 --> 05:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
and right I mean I don't see Signa here
 
05:31:57.788 --> 05:31:57.798 align:start position:0%
right now but there he
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
is it's easier to make our state a
 
05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
perfect world it's easier just to say
 
05:32:05.788 --> 05:32:05.798 align:start position:0%
you know we we would like to see if
 
05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
they're willing to work now I mean anite
 
05:32:10.070 --> 05:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
say no this is coming down from Indiana
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
and you know we're going to do it our
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
way then maybe we have to do it their
 
05:32:14.480 --> 05:32:16.350 align:start position:0%
way then maybe we have to do it their
way

05:32:16.350 --> 05:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:32:19.750 --> 05:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
but they're so big and
 
05:32:22.270 --> 05:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
nasty but but it's something it would be
 
05:32:24.030 --> 05:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
nice if they could all if they could
 
05:32:25.750 --> 05:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
come together and say okay let's have
 
05:32:28.430 --> 05:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
one one uniform way and in the long run
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
that would be actually useful to New
 
05:32:30.400 --> 05:32:33.070 align:start position:0%
that would be actually useful to New
Hampshire

05:32:33.070 --> 05:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:34.788 --> 05:32:34.798 align:start position:0%
constituents so we're going to be
 
05:32:36.670 --> 05:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
working on working with the carriers to
 
05:32:39.070 --> 05:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
see what we can come up with perfect
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:49.110 --> 05:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:54.868 --> 05:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:58.510 --> 05:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
don't oh there you go all right you
 
05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
really wanted Chris to come up
 
05:33:03.708 --> 05:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
first okay all
 
05:33:08.270 --> 05:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
right right okay
 
05:33:10.590 --> 05:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
can both come up come on up you know and
 
05:33:13.708 --> 05:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:16.990 --> 05:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
thinger okay well you know you know in
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
Washington they always have panels they
 
05:33:20.470 --> 05:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
always have multiple people they you
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
know they kind of along you know and
 
05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
then you know and they have corporations
 
05:33:26.270 --> 05:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
you'll see four different corporations
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
and you think How can any of these these
 
05:33:30.670 --> 05:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
four have this have anything they can
 
05:33:33.350 --> 05:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
agree on but I've never gotten to
 
05:33:35.628 --> 05:33:35.638 align:start position:0%
testify next to another carrier what a
 
05:33:39.070 --> 05:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
delight right I'm I'm
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
Overjoyed I'm Spina Dunlap senior
 
05:33:42.430 --> 05:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for
 
05:33:44.350 --> 05:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
Anthem Chris Kennedy vice president
 
05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
external relations for centin and Better
 
05:33:49.110 --> 05:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
Health Plans um so I have just a couple
 
05:33:50.590 --> 05:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
of things that have not been said that I
 
05:33:54.350 --> 05:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
just want to flag um so initially when
 
05:33:55.708 --> 05:33:55.718 align:start position:0%
we saw this bill we thought it just
 
05:33:57.708 --> 05:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
tracked what the federal government
 
05:34:00.910 --> 05:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
already requires but then um I sent it
 
05:34:02.750 --> 05:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
to our team that handles transparency
 
05:34:05.230 --> 05:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
and they were like the concern is around
 
05:34:07.548 --> 05:34:07.558 align:start position:0%
the format of reporting the data which I
 
05:34:09.190 --> 05:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
had initially missed which is that line
 
05:34:10.990 --> 05:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
that was pointed out that is the key
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
difference um and Anthem has seen this
 
05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
play out in Colorado where it was
 
05:34:17.470 --> 05:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
something similar where uh their
 
05:34:19.350 --> 05:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner said we will you
 
05:34:22.190 --> 05:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
know promulgate rules at another time
 
05:34:24.350 --> 05:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
and again I think that bill also largely
 
05:34:25.948 --> 05:34:25.958 align:start position:0%
tracked what was already required under
 
05:34:27.990 --> 05:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
federal law and as it turns out it has
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
turned into um a situation that is quite
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
difficult to navigate because the state
 
05:34:34.990 --> 05:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
requirements are quite different it's
 
05:34:36.788 --> 05:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
turning out to be a different process
 
05:34:39.030 --> 05:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
different formatting the knowledge of
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
how these files are submitted goes
 
05:34:43.868 --> 05:34:43.878 align:start position:0%
beyond my comprehension but I do know
 
05:34:46.350 --> 05:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
that it is very complicated it is a ton
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
of data I know they're involving RT IT
 
05:34:52.030 --> 05:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
architects um to make those changes at
 
05:34:53.990 --> 05:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
the state level so I just wanted to
 
05:34:56.070 --> 05:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
point out that when we talk about these
 
05:34:58.110 --> 05:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
things there is a significant cost to
 
05:34:59.628 --> 05:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
them so I think it is very important to
 
05:35:01.390 --> 05:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
talk about what is the purpose what is
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
the use and we do already turn over a
 
05:35:06.548 --> 05:35:06.558 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of data both to the
 
05:35:08.270 --> 05:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
federal government and with the state I
 
05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
mean all of our rate filing requirements
 
05:35:12.910 --> 05:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
other data requirements things around
 
05:35:14.750 --> 05:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
rebates and Drug pricing we turn over a
 
05:35:16.628 --> 05:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
lot of data already so I just wanted to
 
05:35:18.230 --> 05:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
point out that there is a significant
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
cost every time we're required to do
 
05:35:22.470 --> 05:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
something in a different format um so I
 
05:35:25.030 --> 05:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to caution you on that and
 
05:35:28.270 --> 05:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
one other sort of technical thing um
 
05:35:29.708 --> 05:35:29.718 align:start position:0%
there's a line around requiring
 
05:35:31.628 --> 05:35:31.638 align:start position:0%
prescription drug files that's not
 
05:35:34.030 --> 05:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
currently finalized under federal law
 
05:35:36.030 --> 05:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
and so um our team just pointed out it'
 
05:35:38.030 --> 05:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
be helpful to pause that piece in
 
05:35:39.788 --> 05:35:39.798 align:start position:0%
particular um because we actually
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten the rules from the
 
05:35:43.510 --> 05:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
federal government so um that would be
 
05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
super helpful but I will now turn it
 
05:35:48.150 --> 05:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
over to Chris yeah and and I appreciate
 
05:35:51.310 --> 05:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
not not to be uh redundant I mean I came
 
05:35:52.990 --> 05:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
in this afternoon I actually had no
 
05:35:54.830 --> 05:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
objection to the uh the bill as
 
05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
submitted until I started hearing about
 
05:36:00.510 --> 05:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
it um I you know I will I so I will just
 
05:36:03.270 --> 05:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
say and again you know the the the scope
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
and range of the data the Herculean
 
05:36:07.670 --> 05:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
effort it takes fine you know legit
 
05:36:09.310 --> 05:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
originally look at and I say some poor
 
05:36:11.708 --> 05:36:11.718 align:start position:0%
data analyst team uh that has nothing to
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
do with me is going to have to do that
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
poor them but the only thing I will I
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
will just offer up is in looking at a
 
05:36:19.150 --> 05:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the definitions under uh page two
 
05:36:19.160 --> 05:36:20.110 align:start position:0%
lot of the definitions under uh page two
and

05:36:20.110 --> 05:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:22.470 --> 05:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
three and I have to say this makes me
 
05:36:24.350 --> 05:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
question that the federal requirement to
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
begin with although that's not my
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and I don't know what the
 
05:36:29.910 --> 05:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
Catalyst for that was most of this
 
05:36:31.750 --> 05:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
information it strikes me would be
 
05:36:33.788 --> 05:36:33.798 align:start position:0%
completely useless to Consumers
 
05:36:36.150 --> 05:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
completely useless now I don't know
 
05:36:37.548 --> 05:36:37.558 align:start position:0%
again what format that the department
 
05:36:39.390 --> 05:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
department is going to going to present
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
it and or aggregate it um obviously we'd
 
05:36:43.708 --> 05:36:43.718 align:start position:0%
love to have dialogue there and let me
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
just say the department does a
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
tremendous job uh uh with respect to the
 
05:36:49.510 --> 05:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
data collection and price transparency
 
05:36:51.190 --> 05:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
and a tremendous job in working with the
 
05:36:53.310 --> 05:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
carriers towards that objective which we
 
05:36:56.750 --> 05:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
all want to achieve um but I I I just
 
05:36:58.310 --> 05:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
think some some further dialogue would
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
be useful just in terms of making sure
 
05:37:02.110 --> 05:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
that we're presenting something that's
 
05:37:04.270 --> 05:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
actually consumable and useful for
 
05:37:06.190 --> 05:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
consumers it strikes me that a lot of
 
05:37:08.910 --> 05:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
these things I don't know how many me
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
everyone on on the panel has health
 
05:37:11.750 --> 05:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
insurance how many of you care what we
 
05:37:13.868 --> 05:37:13.878 align:start position:0%
pay one provider versus another it's not
 
05:37:15.430 --> 05:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
reflective of what ultimately your
 
05:37:17.548 --> 05:37:17.558 align:start position:0%
charge and what your premiums are what
 
05:37:20.070 --> 05:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
your co-pays are it's a lot of the
 
05:37:22.270 --> 05:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
information is nebulous and irrelevant I
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
sponsored the original build that had
 
05:37:27.788 --> 05:37:27.798 align:start position:0%
the insurance department and the goal
 
05:37:30.948 --> 05:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
was when we had Tyler doing this was
 
05:37:34.270 --> 05:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
that you would have different bills you
 
05:37:36.030 --> 05:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
get the doctor's bill for a surgery you
 
05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
had the doctor's bill you had the
 
05:37:40.230 --> 05:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
hospital bill and then they had the
 
05:37:43.230 --> 05:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist Bill okay and they were
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
all separate and so how could you
 
05:37:48.868 --> 05:37:48.878 align:start position:0%
compare a procedure you know like I'm
 
05:37:50.510 --> 05:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
going to do a proced
 
05:37:52.830 --> 05:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy how do I compare that from
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
One hospital another if everyone had
 
05:37:57.948 --> 05:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
they didn't all have what the cost price
 
05:38:00.548 --> 05:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
is for the service yeah absolutely but
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
what what what what our fee schedule is
 
05:38:04.708 --> 05:38:04.718 align:start position:0%
with the provider I mean I think is is
 
05:38:07.868 --> 05:38:07.878 align:start position:0%
less useful data so anyway it's it's all
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
towards uh uh I certainly would would
 
05:38:10.990 --> 05:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
look forward to having further
 
05:38:12.670 --> 05:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
conversation with the Department on how
 
05:38:14.270 --> 05:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
we could make this consumable because I
 
05:38:15.830 --> 05:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
do think by the way I think we also do
 
05:38:17.470 --> 05:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
this a lot in our in our member it's
 
05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
already available on our on our websites
 
05:38:20.948 --> 05:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
and our member handbook and what we
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
think is a fairly consumable format for
 
05:38:27.230 --> 05:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
our members um so anyway I I'll one more
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
I I was remiss and um I did not mention
 
05:38:32.190 --> 05:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have talked obviously
 
05:38:33.310 --> 05:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
with the insurance department and
 
05:38:34.868 --> 05:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate their collaboration on this
 
05:38:36.990 --> 05:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
and will continue to have conversations
 
05:38:39.670 --> 05:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
but um anyway I wanted to get those
 
05:38:42.070 --> 05:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
concerns on the record great and you all
 
05:38:49.150 --> 05:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:52.430 --> 05:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
language represent wsh has a
 
05:38:57.948 --> 05:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
question yes does the um excuse me the
 
05:39:00.510 --> 05:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire insurance department
 
05:39:05.628 --> 05:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
have the power to tell the insurance in
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the carriers that they
 
05:39:11.150 --> 05:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
want it in a they want data in a certain
 
05:39:14.548 --> 05:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
format only if we give it to them so it
 
05:39:16.830 --> 05:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
has to be in a has to be a bill we have
 
05:39:20.070 --> 05:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
to legislatively you're asking them so
 
05:39:23.430 --> 05:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
no I ask as a chairman of the committee
 
05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
I often ask departments to fix it
 
05:39:30.390 --> 05:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
without legislation exactly okay uh and
 
05:39:34.070 --> 05:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
yes so in this case we might end up um
 
05:39:35.548 --> 05:39:35.558 align:start position:0%
retaining this
 
05:39:39.430 --> 05:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
bill saying that come September we would
 
05:39:42.670 --> 05:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
have want to know that they've resolved
 
05:39:44.830 --> 05:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
followup further question be inquired
 
05:39:50.830 --> 05:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so just from what I've been
 
05:39:55.510 --> 05:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
hearing the the push back from the
 
05:39:58.270 --> 05:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
insurance industry talking about oh
 
05:40:01.110 --> 05:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
these files are so big and oh my gosh
 
05:40:03.628 --> 05:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
how are we going to do it and I coming
 
05:40:06.990 --> 05:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
from the computer industry um I find
 
05:40:09.990 --> 05:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
that hilarious actually but because
 
05:40:11.350 --> 05:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
there is something new out called
 
05:40:13.708 --> 05:40:13.718 align:start position:0%
software Engineers who make a living of
 
05:40:15.750 --> 05:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
doing being able to do this kind of
 
05:40:19.548 --> 05:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
stuff um but it also repeats why this
 
05:40:21.990 --> 05:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill is needed because you know if it's
 
05:40:24.990 --> 05:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
that dark and deep and complex for you
 
05:40:27.750 --> 05:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
guys what is it to the average consumer
 
05:40:30.070 --> 05:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
and how are we going to kind of figure
 
05:40:32.030 --> 05:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
this all out and that's why the
 
05:40:34.430 --> 05:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
insurance department came in and said
 
05:40:37.468 --> 05:40:37.478 align:start position:0%
hey this is deep dark and complex and
 
05:40:38.948 --> 05:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
from all of these different carriers
 
05:40:40.910 --> 05:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
they don't do it in the same way let's
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
try to have one format so I absolutely
 
05:40:46.750 --> 05:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
agree with this whole concept of making
 
05:40:47.990 --> 05:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
it that way so that's a would you
 
05:40:51.150 --> 05:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
believe I'm sorry yes it
 
05:40:53.750 --> 05:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
is okay Mr chairman can I just say and
 
05:40:55.750 --> 05:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not diminishing at all the the
 
05:40:58.468 --> 05:40:58.478 align:start position:0%
effort it takes to to replicate these
 
05:41:00.590 --> 05:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
files but and so but I'm I'm sensitive
 
05:41:03.310 --> 05:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
to your to your to your concern your
 
05:41:05.230 --> 05:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
your example there but uh I will just
 
05:41:07.350 --> 05:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
say you know what my interest chiefly is
 
05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
is is let's let's make sure the DAT is
 
05:41:11.030 --> 05:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
useful I'd love to work with the
 
05:41:12.110 --> 05:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
Department to make sure we're
 
05:41:13.750 --> 05:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
disseminating this information in in a
 
05:41:15.510 --> 05:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
way that's actually useful to Consumers
 
05:41:17.070 --> 05:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
I think we've we've almost learned more
 
05:41:19.788 --> 05:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
about the federal provision just just
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
now and the uselessness of it and let's
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
not replicate that so I'd love the
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to further have that
 
05:41:27.628 --> 05:41:27.638 align:start position:0%
dialogue with the
 
05:41:31.350 --> 05:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
regulator great thank you both very
 
05:41:36.190 --> 05:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
much having no more cards done they will
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
