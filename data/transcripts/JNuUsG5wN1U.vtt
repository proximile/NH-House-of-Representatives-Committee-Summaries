00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
all right I'll start over again
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
um so I'm opening the subcommittee work
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 207. I've handed
 
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
out to everyone Amendment 1982 h
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
and it just changes
 
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.710 align:start position:0%
and it just changes
um

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
section 7 which deals with the definite
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the emergency medical and Trauma
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
Services critical critical incident
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
intervention management and what I was
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
saying is that
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
this just changes
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
um membership of the teams or and who
 
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.509 align:start position:0%
um membership of the teams or and who
can

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
Point people to it basically and the
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
main point of doing this at all is so
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
that um you know if a fireman or
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
policeman has been through a traumatic
 
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.730 align:start position:0%
policeman has been through a traumatic
situation

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
is being counseled by
 
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
you know other members
 
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
that the people that that the people
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
helping them are
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
allowed to maintain confidentiality
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
because I think the last thing you need
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
deal with being through something
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
traumatic is to be worried about you
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
know censoring your words because you're
 
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
afraid something might be used against
 
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
you basically so and similarly I mean
 
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals have that
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
protection lawyers uh ministers that
 
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
so uh your name is on the amendment but
 
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:20.339 align:start position:0%
this is the language is as you as your
 
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
remarks imply is uh similar to or
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
identical to an uh statutory language
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
that's already out there for other
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
professions to your knowledge
 
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.670 align:start position:0%
professions to your knowledge
um

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
not exactly well I mean the the
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
this is making some changes to existing
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
statute right the existing statutes
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
there and it's uh adding
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
and this is the language that was agreed
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
to by the police and fire folks
 
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
so thank you that was my assumption from
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
your remarks and yeah the only the only
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
difference is OLS caught one other place
 
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:09.740 align:start position:0%
in here where uh
 
00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
peer support group language was in there
 
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
and that was taken out as well it's it's
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
now not used at all I guess that's
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
actually used in a different context and
 
00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
that was providing some
 
00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:25.310 align:start position:0%
that was providing some
concern

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
and possibly confusion so any anybody
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
else have any any other discussion
 
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:39.470 align:start position:0%
else have any any other discussion
questions

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh not seen any uh would somebody
 
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
maybe to uh adopt this amendment or I
 
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.470 align:start position:0%
maybe to uh adopt this amendment or I
can

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll move them in okay
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh sec I'll second it
 
00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
so any any other discussion on the
 
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.769 align:start position:0%
so any any other discussion on the
amendment

00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
all right see none
 
00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.710 align:start position:0%
all right see none
um

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
so we're voting whether or not one other
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say is that you know there's
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
the non-termaine amendment to SB 207 and
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
possibly other things so the if we vote
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
to accept this
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
and or and recommend that to the full
 
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
committee then I think the full
 
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
committee and exact session later today
 
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
is going to have a vote on this on uh
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
Jackie's non-germaine Amendment and
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's another issue
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
and however that vote comes out then
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
there'll be a combined Amendment drafted
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
and we'll have to exec it at the next
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
meeting just to accept that Amendment
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
but that's the process so
 
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.230 align:start position:0%
but that's the process so
yep

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality aspect I mean you
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
have some could that be used for ill as
 
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
well as well
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
we're going to cover up this thing by
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
you being my counselor well that that
 
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.610 align:start position:0%
you being my counselor well that that
doesn't

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
the person counseling them can't be
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
required to divulge what was said but
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't prevent and the members of
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
your peer group right but that doesn't
 
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:04.940 align:start position:0%
well that doesn't prevent any other
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
investigation or disciplinary process
 
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
from proceeding so it doesn't provide
 
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
protection outside of people who have
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
been assigned to provide you counseling
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issue but I think it
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
specifically says that they you can't be
 
00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
compelled to testify
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
um the one who can't be compelled to
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
testify is the person who's counseling
 
00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:26.150 align:start position:0%
testify is the person who's counseling
you

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
except that's providers you can see no
 
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
person with a critical incident stress
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
management team member or team leader or
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
peer group support member providing or
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
receiving critical incident stress
 
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
management Crisis Intervention or peer
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
support services shall be required to
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
testify or divulging information
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
obtained solely so through such Crisis
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
Intervention right solely through
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
exactly so any other I mean if there was
 
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.670 align:start position:0%
exactly so any other I mean if there was
no

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
let's say they weren't involved in this
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh peer counseling thing you know
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
there's uh
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
things in place to for uh investigations
 
00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:14.459 align:start position:0%
I mean criminal or just internship
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
everybody involved in the peer group ah
 
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
yeah you're kind of absolving them from
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
telling the truth about something that
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
went bad you know well
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
I I get what you're you're getting at
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
but I think that if um
 
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
you know everybody was involved in an
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
incident is is part of that's made part
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
of the peer support group I think that's
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
not going to look good and there will be
 
00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:46.019 align:start position:0%
and any other investigation can still
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
perform so Yeah by an outside person
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
who's not equipped with the information
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
uh once you are working or or the
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
department or the AG or you know
 
00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.629 align:start position:0%
department or the AG or you know
right

00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
no you're aware of that and you're
 
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.670 align:start position:0%

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
why you didn't vote right
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
you're we are aware of that I just want
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
the other subcommittee members to
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
understand that I'm not on the floor
 
00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to close the uh work
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
session subcommittee work session on
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 207
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to open the subcommittee
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
work session on Senate bill
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.170 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
if people remember from the last
 
00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:17.339 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session
 
00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:18.829 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session
um

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
I had pointed out that what RSA here
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
that RSA 170-e50
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
grants uh DHHS rulemaking authority to
 
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.829 align:start position:0%
grants uh DHHS rulemaking authority to
create

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
professional certification for child
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
care programs and in fact as I
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
all the other certification for child
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
care programs was done through
 
00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:44.449 align:start position:0%
care programs was done through
rulemaking

00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:44.459 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
so it didn't seem like this was
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
necessary and you know the question was
 
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.189 align:start position:0%
necessary and you know the question was
why

00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
you know whether there's something to
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
prevent DHHS from creating this
 
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
certificate through rulemaking or if
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
there is there's some reason they didn't
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
and I sent
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
um at least everybody in the
 
00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:04.189 align:start position:0%
um at least everybody in the
subcommittee

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh some email exchanges between myself
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
and Diane Chase of DHHS and Carol
 
00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:12.710 align:start position:0%
and Diane Chase of DHHS and Carol
McGuire

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
and they have DHHS is committed to
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
creating this certification through
 
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.510 align:start position:0%
creating this certification through
rulemaking

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
and they said they can do it and they
 
00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
will do it uh chair Maguire said she's
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
going to send them an official letter
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
letter from the Edna committee letting
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
them know that that's what we expect
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
them to do
 
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
and so what I I'd like to propose
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
um retaining this bill
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
and if they do proceed and do this to
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
rulemaking then in the fall we can I
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
tell it and if they don't then well we
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
can make them
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
so any discussion on that
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
okay I'll second that okay I'll move it
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
you second it all right
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
um any any further question or
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on this okay makes perfect
 
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
sense all right sorry about this
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
represent Bailey yes representative
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
goalie and I vote Yes
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
and so I'm closing the subcommittee work
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 106 and we're
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
done with this subcommittee
 
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
um so for everybody who's in the room
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee on the pension does
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee meeting going from
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
10 to 10 30 although I'm hoping it won't
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
take quite that long to get this done
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
um I've handed out to all of the
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members uh amendments
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
2023-1951h it basically just replaces
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
the whole bill
 
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh with the updated building codes that
 
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:20.420 align:start position:0%
the building code review board has
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
approved to allow these new refrigerants
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
to operate in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.950 align:start position:0%
to operate in the state of New Hampshire
safely

01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
safely
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I sent out that information last
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
night if you are super curious in it you
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
could have looked through the 47 pages
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
of code
 
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
um but did anybody on the subcommittee
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
comment about this amendment or any
 
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
just for the record Mr chairman so the
 
01:05:49.559 --> 01:05:50.650 align:start position:0%
just for the record Mr chairman so the
changes

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:50.660 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
are just lines 15 and 16 and 16. yep
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
right we passed legislation similar
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
earlier that was November 30th so they
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
just had this meeting and updated these
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
codes and then are looking for approval
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
on the ones for the reflections I I I
 
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
believe I understand and I'm okay with
 
01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.730 align:start position:0%
believe I understand and I'm okay with
that

01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.870 align:start position:0%
that
okay

01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
yes representative true
 
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339 align:start position:0%
um is anyone speaking today
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of is there anybody
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
who'd like to
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't think so according to my uh
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
very extensive notes
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to avoid is not having
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
this in rsas and building codes
 
01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
separately correct
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that's the way this corrects but it
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
does that this this gets it to the
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
finalized product that we want
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
without having to do the multiple steps
 
01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%

morning and everything is ready to go

and we'll talk about directions
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.719 --> 01:31:12.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
good morning before we get to our
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
executive session we have two bills that
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate has amended
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
the first one is House Bill 409
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
which was completely replaced by a
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
I believe 50 page Amendment
 
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
and which includes a lot of words from
 
01:31:44.410 --> 01:31:44.420 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 655 and some other points
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
and the social work compact
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to recommend we go to
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference on that because
 
01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:56.420 align:start position:0%
this is the side-by-side analysis
 
01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think we can decide
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
we want to talk to the have the
 
01:32:04.129 --> 01:32:04.139 align:start position:0%
committee read the bill
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
read the amendment and discuss with the
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
Senate what they think they're doing
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
any anybody have objections to that
 
01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.790 align:start position:0%
any anybody have objections to that
okay

01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
I will forward the uh
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh electronic version the one one paper
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
copy should be plenty
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
all right so uh if nobody objects I'll
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
tell the clerk that is there anyone
 
01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
interested in serving on that
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on the committee of
 
01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.129 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on the committee of
conference

01:32:37.129 --> 01:32:37.139 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:32:37.139 --> 01:32:41.330 align:start position:0%
conference
okay

01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.689 --> 01:32:43.699 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
I did she heard okay yeah well I'll I'll
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
put you on the list and anybody else if
 
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
if you don't say you're not interested
 
01:32:56.209 --> 01:32:56.219 align:start position:0%
you're subject to being appointed
 
01:32:56.219 --> 01:32:59.090 align:start position:0%
you're subject to being appointed
so

01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
so anyhow that that one looks like it's
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's got to be discussed
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
the other one is House Bill 461 which
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
left us as requiring a penalty if a
 
01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
left us as requiring a penalty if a
municipality

01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
uh chose to replace a full-time
 
01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
high level position with part-time
 
01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
and the Senate amended it to make it a
 
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
study committee on this on the subject
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm inclined to say just don't Concur
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
and let and let somebody bring something
 
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
in next year if they still care
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody have strong feelings on
 
01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:43.790 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody have strong feelings on
that

01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
you'd like to study no I don't
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I was saying okay
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
so Simon
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
Raymond and goalie want to go to
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference I'm happy with
 
01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:05.810 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference I'm happy with
that

01:34:05.810 --> 01:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
any objections
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt does not want to
 
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
be on that Committee of conference
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
fine representative true
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
um but we're going to Committee of
 
01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:26.540 align:start position:0%
conference to defend that position
 
01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
absolutely and nothing less
 
01:34:29.699 --> 01:34:31.850 align:start position:0%
absolutely and nothing less
right

01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
yeah can't do more
 
01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
all right so we will uh I'll I'll tell
 
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
the clerk that and we'll get to that
 
01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
the clerk that and we'll get to that
and

01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
and let's see these are our last Senate
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill so if we reach reach agreement on
 
01:34:57.649 --> 01:34:57.659 align:start position:0%
them today we will not have to come back
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
as a committee so
 
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
there we go Senate Bill 207 Tony you
 
01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee Amendment
 
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
you could explain it emotion explain it
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
to us and uh
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
um Amendment 1982 H to Senate Bill 207
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
and just uh refresh people this this
 
01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:25.129 align:start position:0%
and just uh refresh people this this
bill

01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
um is related to a situation where
 
01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
you've got police or fire who are in
 
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
some traumatic situation
 
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know other other such people
 
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
can provide counseling and by having
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
that set up the people doing the
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
counseling are covered under another
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
part of the statute that provides them
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
with some exceptions
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
confidentiality the idea is that if
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
you've dealt with a traumatic situation
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
and you're talking with somebody you
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
kind of work through it it's not helpful
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
if you have to uh carefully censor what
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
you say because you're worried it might
 
01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
be used against you and it's for the
 
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
same same reasons that mental health
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
professionals have that confidentiality
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
and you know religious ministers pastors
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
and whatever
 
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.430 align:start position:0%
and whatever
um

01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the amendment
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
was agreed to between the uh the police
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
and the fire folks and it just changes
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
you know who can who the members can be
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
and who can um it adds to who can
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
so originally this Bill had a study
 
01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
committee in the did you leave that in
 
01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.189 align:start position:0%
committee in the did you leave that in
there

01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
um I my understanding of what Carol's
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
planning is we'll deal with that issue
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
separately this amendment
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
by itself doesn't remove it
 
01:36:57.900 --> 01:36:59.030 align:start position:0%
by itself doesn't remove it
but

01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
um you can also have another amendment
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
right I mean there's I think we're going
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
to be voting at least three things for
 
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
this and one of them is a study
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee but that's not in this amount
 
01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:10.139 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so there'll be other
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
amendments on this bill that's my
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
understanding okay there's a rather
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hefty one is yours for example
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
so this is purely about section seven
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
the medical service Emergency Services
 
01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.490 align:start position:0%
the medical service Emergency Services
um

01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
so moved by representative
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
Lucas and is it seconded
 
01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:39.430 align:start position:0%
Lucas and is it seconded
okay

01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
and any anyone else have comments
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%

01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative Brody it Luke reads to me
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
is though this is for someone who is
 
01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:26.209 align:start position:0%
is though this is for someone who is
uh

01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%

01:41:31.729 --> 01:41:31.739 align:start position:0%
for license but is working on them yes
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%

01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
are registering here for the first time
 
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:38.940 align:start position:0%

Associates

01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%

any other discussion comment comments
questions

01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I'll point out I I had
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
suggested a slight change to
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative groda's Amendment because
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
there are several places in the
 
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that it refers to an acronym
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
cswe when I was actually looking at it I
 
01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
was saying to myself well is that c
 
01:42:46.370 --> 01:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
clinical or certified or exactly what is
 
01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
that so I went back to the original
 
01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
statute and the first place that that
 
01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
acronym is listed it still doesn't
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
explain it I I went through my notes and
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
discovered that it should be the Council
 
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
on social workers education so so that's
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
on page three line 15.
 
01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:12.179 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
um uh and I'm just suggesting that
 
01:43:16.139 --> 01:43:16.850 align:start position:0%
um uh and I'm just suggesting that
um

01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
if we adopt this amendment that that
 
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
should be clarified for statutes
 
01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:25.139 align:start position:0%
someplace well I think perhaps it could
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
be done as an enrolled Amendment if the
 
01:43:30.410 --> 01:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
committee agrees uh I think we're going
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
dealing with the previous Amendment as
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
well so this will not be the final
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment so we might as well spell it
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll change this on
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
page 3 line 15 to spell out c c a c r e
 
01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:52.910 align:start position:0%
page 3 line 15 to spell out c c a c r e
p

01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
p
 
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
no it's page page one online 31. Adam
 
01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.629 align:start position:0%
no it's page page one online 31. Adam
Chad

01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
Chad
 
01:43:59.639 --> 01:44:01.370 align:start position:0%
Chad
oh

01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the first
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
that's the only one I couldn't see that
 
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
but line 22 as well line 22 yeah that
 
01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
fine so line 22 being higher we spell it
 
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
out on that one right okay spell out the
 
01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
acronym is there any objection to doing
 
01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:28.010 align:start position:0%
acronym is there any objection to doing
so

01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
okay we'll do that as an editorial
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
comment then
 
01:44:35.209 --> 01:44:35.219 align:start position:0%

01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
just I just want to point out that it
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
also creates a um
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't this create a committee or
 
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:49.500 align:start position:0%

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.470 align:start position:0%

01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
and um that's in the original Bill not
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment oh and we will
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
oh I see that's the amended analysis
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%

Mental Health Professions
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a formal Amendment for
 
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
that but I move we delete it
 
01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:26.930 align:start position:0%
that but I move we delete it
just

01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
I want to put out uh section one is
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
legislative findings I'm okay removing
 
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
it but it's not part of the committee ah
 
01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:35.030 align:start position:0%
it but it's not part of the committee ah
defined

01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
I'll correct that to be sections two
 
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.129 --> 01:46:43.139 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:46:43.139 --> 01:46:48.950 align:start position:0%
is there a second
okay

01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing this because the speaker
 
01:46:54.530 --> 01:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
has asked us not to create any
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
unnecessary study committees when we had
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
the hearing we agreed that the timing
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
and schedule on this was not sufficient
 
01:47:06.169 --> 01:47:06.179 align:start position:0%
to actually accomplish very much
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
and thirdly we already have several
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
retained bills on Mental Health
 
01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
licensing and we will be looking into it
 
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
anyway we don't need a separate study
 
01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:19.139 align:start position:0%
committee to keep doing what we plan to
 
01:47:19.139 --> 01:47:20.810 align:start position:0%
committee to keep doing what we plan to
do

01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative Simon do you have
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
something to add
 
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh no you said it well thank you
 
01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
anyone else representing Broda thank you
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%

was on the original bill for the study
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee I will support the motion
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
case the motion is to delete sections
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%

early okay
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
all right so we have we will request a
 
01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:35.219 align:start position:0%
composite Amendment which will
 
01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
leave section one alone
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
delete sections two through six which is
 
01:48:43.930 --> 01:48:43.940 align:start position:0%
the study committee replace section 7
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
and add sections 8 through 11 from
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1915.
 
01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.550 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1915.
and

01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
then section 7 is
 
01:49:10.729 --> 01:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
the effective dates would be
 
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:18.109 align:start position:0%
for the
um

01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
the conditional licenses 60 days after
 
01:49:24.410 --> 01:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
passage which should be after Senate
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 655 goes into effect
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
the other one's on passage because
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's not a
 
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
not a question of interference
 
01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.219 --> 01:49:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
so the motion
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
is to amend Senate Bill 207 in these
 
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:53.810 --> 01:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'll make that motion and is there a
 
01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.310 align:start position:0%
I'll make that motion and is there a
second

01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:49:57.290 --> 01:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
representative blackis
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
all right I've said enough
 
01:50:01.609 --> 01:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
01:50:05.330 --> 01:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I think we've covered it okay anyone
 
01:50:11.689 --> 01:50:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay in that case the motion is to amend
 
01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:16.679 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 207 and the clerk can call
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative Simon yes representative
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%

Greenland would you deal with OLS to get
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
 
01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
all right I have an amendment
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
um which is over on the table I'll pass
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.970 --> 01:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
thank you I want to remind myself what I
 
01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:30.530 align:start position:0%
thank you I want to remind myself what I
did

01:52:30.530 --> 01:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:48.129 align:start position:0%
did
okay

01:52:48.129 --> 01:52:48.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:57.169 --> 01:52:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:57.179 --> 01:53:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
so um I moved Amendment
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is a
 
01:53:38.050 --> 01:53:38.060 align:start position:0%
a revision to the marital masters board
 
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
at their request to reduce the number of
 
01:53:43.609 --> 01:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
members and
 
01:53:43.619 --> 01:53:45.050 align:start position:0%
members and
um

01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
so that they can have a quorum
 
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
so we agreed
 
01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
that they should reduce the number of
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
members of the board
 
01:53:54.659 --> 01:53:57.290 align:start position:0%
members of the board
and

01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:59.950 --> 01:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
the bill the amendment has three parts
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
first it defines a quorum as three
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to put any limits on
 
01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:08.699 align:start position:0%
people who were appointed I said I
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
figured if you have fewer than three
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
people there you can't really have an
 
01:54:16.490 --> 01:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
effective meeting so Quorum is three
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
the marital Master Seat
 
01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
being eliminated immediately is because
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
the there aren't any more marital
 
01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:26.149 align:start position:0%
the there aren't any more marital
Masters

01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
Masters
 
01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
so it can't isn't filled can't be filled
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
we'll just eliminate it and then the
 
01:54:36.770 --> 01:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
third part is to
 
01:54:39.850 --> 01:54:39.860 align:start position:0%
delete the requirement for setting fees
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
in the requirements for interns and then
 
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
repeal RSA 328 C11 on fees because
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
that's all been
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
superseded by House Bill 655 and the
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
oplc fee set fee setting Authority
 
01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:01.490 align:start position:0%

02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
so it gives the authority to the to oplc
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
to investigate
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
and the appointments from a panel
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
clinical clinicians will be conducted by
 
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
the executive director
 
02:02:02.649 --> 02:02:02.659 align:start position:0%
so these are the four
 
02:02:09.250 --> 02:02:09.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
no I think
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
as far as no one has any further
 
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
questions I think representative growth
 
02:02:20.089 --> 02:02:20.099 align:start position:0%
explained it pretty well
 
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt well here I think
 
02:02:24.890 --> 02:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
it should be mentioned that it most
 
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
importantly it eliminates uh the section
 
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
of the Senate Amendment uh that was
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
causing lots of concern a members of the
 
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
public and a lot of other people so
 
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
that's completely deleted yes
 
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
yes and I would like to say that this is
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
it started as the sections we took out
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
of house bill 655 for further discussion
 
02:02:56.689 --> 02:02:56.699 align:start position:0%
and Analysis and so it cleans up a lot
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
of language that
 
02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:00.470 align:start position:0%
of language that
um

02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:02.890 --> 02:03:02.900 align:start position:0%
that we need the medical review
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has had some problems with
 
02:03:10.729 --> 02:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
uh conflict of interest
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
and this language establishes that the
 
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
board will say what kind of people they
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
need and then the
 
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
oplc will appoint them to that
 
02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:24.530 align:start position:0%
oplc will appoint them to that
subcommittee

02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
um there's one other thing the
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
um the electrician's board we want to
 
02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:32.629 align:start position:0%
um the electrician's board we want to
repeal

02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
we want to delete I think it's line one
 
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
on page seven
 
02:03:39.370 --> 02:03:39.380 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
removes their ability to appeal
 
02:03:46.129 --> 02:03:46.139 align:start position:0%
to the building code Review Board in
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
cases of conflicts about the
 
02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the building codes
 
02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:55.129 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the building codes
because

02:03:55.129 --> 02:03:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
it would be a lot easier to deal with
 
02:03:58.850 --> 02:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
the building code review board than with
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
a judge in that case
 
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
um is that the line that we you agreed
 
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
to take out yeah okay so that's line one
 
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:14.209 --> 02:04:14.219 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative I just wanted to say that
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative Grodd and I went over
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
this in great detail with uh director
 
02:04:25.129 --> 02:04:25.139 align:start position:0%
Courtney and uh
 
02:04:28.669 --> 02:04:28.679 align:start position:0%
attorney osterhout and you know I'm fine
 
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.050 --> 02:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
I guess we have I guess the
 
02:04:49.850 --> 02:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
subcommittees have to be have beaten
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%

anyone else
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative yep
 
02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:46.729 align:start position:0%
representative yep
um

02:10:46.729 --> 02:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.739 --> 02:10:49.490 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
this thing did originally uh repeal
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
um the right to petition the board for
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
review of a criminal record however the
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
amendment we just adopted uh replaced
 
02:11:03.890 --> 02:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
that so that remains
 
02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:05.030 align:start position:0%
that so that remains
um

02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
and as far as how long adjudication can
 
02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:09.290 align:start position:0%
and as far as how long adjudication can
take

02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
a little surprise to see two years I
 
02:11:13.129 --> 02:11:13.139 align:start position:0%
might have liked Lost but I wasn't going
 
02:11:15.649 --> 02:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
to do anything about it well that's the
 
02:11:17.689 --> 02:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
that's to allow time for the
 
02:11:21.410 --> 02:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
um that's a very generous limit yeah
 
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
yeah but they're
 
02:11:29.209 --> 02:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
in the recent past there have been
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
investigations that dragged on for much
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
longer than two years
 
02:11:35.149 --> 02:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
we hope that that would not be the case
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the future right okay yeah I mean
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
having somebody under that cloud that
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
long seems to be a problem but I'm not
 
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
going to object to it at this point okay
 
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
well the thing is it it permits a a
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
process of up to two years right it
 
02:11:57.169 --> 02:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it requires two years they
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
could get potentially it could get done
 
02:12:02.089 --> 02:12:02.099 align:start position:0%
with it quicker more quickly we will
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
hope that the expedited processes that
 
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create here will work
 
02:12:09.530 --> 02:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
better than what we have in the
 
02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
executive director is nodding in
 
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
agreement so it says they must hold the
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
final hearing within two years
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
we hope it'll be quicker all right any
 
02:12:24.070 --> 02:12:24.080 align:start position:0%

all right the motion passes 20-0 and the
 
02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
objections to consent
 
02:13:18.169 --> 02:13:18.179 align:start position:0%

02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 106. representative grassy
 
02:13:27.649 --> 02:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
you have a motion
 
02:13:30.169 --> 02:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh yes Madam chairperson and I'd move
 
02:13:33.169 --> 02:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
that we retain this bill oh second
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to speak to your
 
02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:37.790 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to speak to your
emotions

02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.490 --> 02:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
um short not much though it's uh the
 
02:13:42.050 --> 02:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
thing is this is something that the
 
02:13:44.109 --> 02:13:44.119 align:start position:0%
child care providers have asked for
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
HHS says they can do this without going
 
02:13:49.370 --> 02:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
to rules so they can do it themselves
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
possibly and what I'd like to see if
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
they can get that done this summer
 
02:13:54.890 --> 02:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
that's fine if they don't then we may
 
02:13:56.689 --> 02:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
have to force their hand
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative I think it was just
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
covered I'm good any other questions
 
02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
clarification I didn't quite hear which
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
the all the requirements for these
 
02:14:15.729 --> 02:14:15.739 align:start position:0%
certificates are in rules not in statute
 
02:14:17.930 --> 02:14:17.940 align:start position:0%

behalf of the committee a letter to the
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of hh-sc formally asking
 
02:15:25.609 --> 02:15:25.619 align:start position:0%
them to initiate rulemaking on this
 
02:15:25.619 --> 02:15:26.589 align:start position:0%
them to initiate rulemaking on this
issue

02:15:26.589 --> 02:15:26.599 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:15:29.149 --> 02:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we want them to do it so let's
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:39.119 --> 02:15:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%

02:15:44.810 --> 02:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 105 representative lacques I
 
02:15:46.729 --> 02:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
believe you have a second amendment
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to be to adopt an amendment
 
02:15:54.770 --> 02:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
and if you give me a moment I'll have
 
02:15:57.410 --> 02:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
your moment is it 1728 is it the one we
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
did in the subcommittee
 
02:16:06.530 --> 02:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.290 --> 02:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
I have two well it's House Bill 105.
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me that's my mistake extended
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.850 --> 02:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
yes I'm uh but I can pass that to
 
02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:30.770 --> 02:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:31.490 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

02:16:31.490 --> 02:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
the original intent of this bill
 
02:16:37.129 --> 02:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
this bill concerns the information that
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
both um
 
02:16:42.889 --> 02:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
a new mother is required to provide when
 
02:16:46.009 --> 02:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
the child is born and also the
 
02:16:49.089 --> 02:16:49.099 align:start position:0%
information that the facility
 
02:16:52.009 --> 02:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
provides and
 
02:16:54.770 --> 02:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
there was actually a committee that
 
02:16:57.410 --> 02:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald chaired that I was on
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
concerning this and the concern was
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of private information
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
that is required to be included
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
and there were in fact criminal
 
02:17:10.310 --> 02:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
penalties if inaccurate information was
 
02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
provided no it didn't didn't say
 
02:17:14.089 --> 02:17:14.099 align:start position:0%
inaccurate it says false information
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
well false so there's knowingly false so
 
02:17:17.639 --> 02:17:20.810 align:start position:0%
well false so there's knowingly false so
right

02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:22.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:17:26.810 --> 02:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
I'm actually finally Amendment here
 
02:17:31.490 --> 02:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
I have copies apologize are you looking
 
02:17:35.810 --> 02:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
for the amendment yeah which I know I
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
have in here
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:43.370 --> 02:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm all set I'll take it thank you
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
so one was to get rid of the uh the
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties for the information
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
other than for the information that was
 
02:17:57.589 --> 02:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
required to create a birth certificate
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
because uh if you you know that could be
 
02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:04.019 align:start position:0%
used for purposes of fraud
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and the goal had been to keep that
 
02:18:09.410 --> 02:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
information private at least if the
 
02:18:14.770 --> 02:18:14.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
concern about the impact of not having
 
02:18:20.929 --> 02:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
the information then the Senate amended
 
02:18:23.389 --> 02:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
it but their Amendment basically made it
 
02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
so it was impossible for the Secretary
 
02:18:27.290 --> 02:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
of State to issue birth certificates
 
02:18:29.570 --> 02:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
which is kind of a problem and there
 
02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
just wasn't time to um
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
the process where we could keep as much
 
02:18:40.250 --> 02:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
information private private as possible
 
02:18:43.009 --> 02:18:43.019 align:start position:0%
and still not cause other problems
 
02:18:45.290 --> 02:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
so the options would have been to retain
 
02:18:47.810 --> 02:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
it to work on it but instead this
 
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
amendment 1728 h
 
02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh keeps the part that decriminalizes it
 
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
uh you know the information that's
 
02:18:58.250 --> 02:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
provided that is not related to the
 
02:19:00.049 --> 02:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
birth certificate the other thing that
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
was the original bill is current statute
 
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
requires that the hospital or birthing
 
02:19:08.810 --> 02:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
Place keeps the records basically for
 
02:19:08.820 --> 02:19:10.089 align:start position:0%
Place keeps the records basically for
eternity

02:19:10.089 --> 02:19:10.099 align:start position:0%
eternity
 
02:19:13.490 --> 02:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
and this drops it down to seven years
 
02:19:17.570 --> 02:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
which is common for uh for other records
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.570 --> 02:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative oh yeah I'll let do you
 
02:19:25.969 --> 02:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
have a comment I do well I don't know if
 
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
there was a second but if there's a
 
02:19:29.889 --> 02:19:29.899 align:start position:0%
second I'll make a second um
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative ruckus's motion to adopt
 
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:19:38.349 --> 02:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else I I
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
the seven years is because
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
if a parent neglects to get a birth
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
certificate immediately upon the birth
 
02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
of a child the most usual time they come
 
02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
come back for it is when the kid goes to
 
02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:56.630 align:start position:0%
come back for it is when the kid goes to
school

02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
and therefore seven years of retention
 
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
of this record will allow
 
02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:03.170 align:start position:0%
of this record will allow
um

02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:06.290 --> 02:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
a birth certificate
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
a delayed birth certificate without as
 
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
much hassles it would be if they had to
 
02:20:13.010 --> 02:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
try and recreate memories and things
 
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:15.950 align:start position:0%
like that
um

02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
while retaining privacy I thought that
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
it was very important that we not burden
 
02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
the parents I don't mind so much
 
02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
burdening the hospitals but the parents
 
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
should not be burdened any more than
 
02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:31.490 align:start position:0%
should not be burdened any more than
necessary

02:20:31.490 --> 02:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:20:31.500 --> 02:20:33.889 align:start position:0%
necessary
so

02:20:33.889 --> 02:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:36.650 --> 02:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
that's why seven years yes
 
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
in my time here in the legislature
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's been very few bills that have
 
02:20:46.730 --> 02:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
gotten me really really fired up or that
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
I've thought about for several days
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
after we heard them so I'm proud to be
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
part of this although it's not perfect
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
and where we all wanted to go with it it
 
02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
anyway I can't represent a Bailey
 
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
well a question there was an earlier
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh 1504 what happened to that
 
02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
so which seems to include the same
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
material as this most current one in the
 
02:21:16.849 --> 02:21:16.859 align:start position:0%
final piece this one is it had earlier
 
02:21:19.130 --> 02:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
sections it's simpler I can help with
 
02:21:21.770 --> 02:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
that it's this in the subcommittee that
 
02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
a memo is not adopted it was done this
 
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
one was the one that was adopted so it
 
02:21:27.349 --> 02:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
took out the part about the mother's
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
medical records correct yeah record
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
number correct
 
02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:37.130 align:start position:0%
number correct
gold

02:21:37.130 --> 02:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
just as a genealogist and also as
 
02:21:42.349 --> 02:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
someone who handled data for dcyf I want
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
to thank the committee and everybody
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
who's worked so hard in this it raised a
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
lot of concern across a lot of sectors
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
that work with the data and you all did
 
02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
a great job thank you
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative shuitt
 
02:21:57.290 --> 02:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:21:59.090 --> 02:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
um just to chime in
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Aber that
 
02:22:04.510 --> 02:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
this bill presented quite a few issues
 
02:22:07.849 --> 02:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
and at first I thought that retention
 
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
was the way to go however I'm
 
02:22:13.370 --> 02:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
particularly glad to see that something
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
is coming forward so that we can get rid
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
of the penalty that was out there thank
 
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you madam
 
02:22:30.410 --> 02:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
chair so I I I want to just make sure
 
02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
the record reflects the fact that we had
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of public input uh with regard to
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh the absolutely essential aspect of uh
 
02:22:42.969 --> 02:22:42.979 align:start position:0%
the medical ASP uh
 
02:22:46.370 --> 02:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
screening that's done that goes into the
 
02:22:50.770 --> 02:22:50.780 align:start position:0%
records uh that uh that there's some
 
02:22:55.070 --> 02:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
extremely pernicious uh childhood uh
 
02:22:57.950 --> 02:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
abnormalities that that can occur which
 
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
can be a you know virtually limited if
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're screened immediately or
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
virtually immediately uh and if if this
 
02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
if this information is not
 
02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
obtained and acted upon uh you can have
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
people's lives dramatically uh
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
diminished as a result of it so I think
 
02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
the public should know that that we are
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to still support that kind of
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
information gathering without uh putting
 
02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
the public in general Jeopardy
 
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
especially the the the knowingly false
 
02:23:37.849 --> 02:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
information aspect of the existing
 
02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
statute that we don't want so thank you
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
all right thank you other other
 
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
representative leckis yeah just for the
 
02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:45.950 align:start position:0%
representative leckis yeah just for the
record

02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:46.550 align:start position:0%
record
um

02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know even if this bill as originally
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
written had passed it would actually we
 
02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
did get that testimony people were
 
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about it
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
um but even the original bill would not
 
02:23:59.870 --> 02:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
have stopped the requirement that that
 
02:24:02.330 --> 02:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
early childhood testing be done that's
 
02:24:04.130 --> 02:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's other statute
 
02:24:06.530 --> 02:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
and things that set that in place and
 
02:24:08.450 --> 02:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's an obligation on the doctor in the
 
02:24:10.010 --> 02:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
health care facility
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
so whether or not HHS had the
 
02:24:15.050 --> 02:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
information on what was done I mean that
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
was still an obligation and so while I
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
understand you know people were
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
concerned that this that might impact it
 
02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it really would have
 
02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:27.469 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it really would have
anyway

02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay

02:24:40.429 --> 02:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none the motion is to
 
02:24:46.969 --> 02:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment 1728 to Senate bill 105.

bill 105.
 
02:25:38.090 --> 02:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
is there a second

rep representative Simon you have on
 
02:26:49.849 --> 02:26:49.859 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 53 you love emotion yes
 
02:26:51.050 --> 02:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
ma'am chair I would like to move
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:02.270 --> 02:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay you should speak to your motion
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
um yes so um this bill dealt with
 
02:27:07.670 --> 02:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
um new refrigerants that are being
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
released to the market because the uh do
 
02:27:12.770 --> 02:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
the federal Clean Air Act uh the
 
02:27:14.270 --> 02:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
refrigerants that we currently use are
 
02:27:15.650 --> 02:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
going to be phased out over the next
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
period of time and so
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
um this amendment basically
 
02:27:24.889 --> 02:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
um puts into building code
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
um the necessary code to make the new
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
refrigerants legal to produce and use in
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it's been
 
02:27:33.050 --> 02:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the building code review
 
02:27:34.849 --> 02:27:34.859 align:start position:0%
board and they're just looking for our
 
02:27:34.859 --> 02:27:37.309 align:start position:0%
board and they're just looking for our
ratification

02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
ratification
 
02:27:39.170 --> 02:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
representative true do you wish to speak
 
02:27:42.650 --> 02:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
so I view this as a a problem that has
 
02:27:51.170 --> 02:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
been created uh by the Clean Air Act
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
and our reaction to it
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:02.210 --> 02:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
people are able to builders are able to
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
install the new refrigerant gases
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
because the the ones we currently are
 
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
using uh being uh
 
02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:13.570 align:start position:0%
using uh being uh
uh

02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:13.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
withdrawn uh you stop throwing away
 
02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:20.929 align:start position:0%
withdrawn uh you stop throwing away
um

02:28:20.929 --> 02:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:23.450 --> 02:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
it's just something we have to do
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so I support the support team member
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else comments
 
02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
definitely true thank you thank you
 
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
every word representative I do want to
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
clarify that when we um update
 
02:28:40.130 --> 02:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the future will be
 
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
updating the building codes
 
02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
and when we do update them this is going
 
02:28:47.090 --> 02:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
to be part of the definition of the
 
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
building codes now so this will
 
02:28:50.809 --> 02:28:50.819 align:start position:0%
automatically be part of the building
 
02:28:52.730 --> 02:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
code updates should this need to change
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you yes the building
 
02:28:56.929 --> 02:28:56.939 align:start position:0%
code review board
 
02:29:00.170 --> 02:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
when that we go to a newer edition of
 
02:29:03.790 --> 02:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
the building code we will they normally
 
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
include any amendments that are still
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
relevant that were adopted earlier
 
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to comment that this
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
merely in increases the number and type
 
02:29:20.570 --> 02:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
of refrigerant that can be made in or
 
02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
sold in or used in the state it doesn't
 
02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:25.070 align:start position:0%
sold in or used in the state it doesn't
delete

02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
delete
 
02:29:28.130 --> 02:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
the authority to use any existing
 
02:29:30.349 --> 02:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
refrigerants or any equipment that uses
 
02:29:33.170 --> 02:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
existing refrigerant it just says you
 
02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
can also as an option use these others
 
02:29:39.290 --> 02:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's
 
02:29:41.330 --> 02:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh if they're going to be coming more
 
02:29:43.849 --> 02:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
widely available we want to adopt that
 
02:29:43.859 --> 02:29:46.130 align:start position:0%
widely available we want to adopt that
position

02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:46.140 align:start position:0%

02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none the motion is to
 
02:30:00.650 --> 02:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment 1959 to excuse me 1951.
 
02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:02.330 align:start position:0%
