Murray thank you Mr Speaker and good
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
morning to my colleagues um members of
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
the bill before us now is an important
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
first step in restoring public trust in
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
our local law enforcement and demanding
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability from the
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
government this legislation requires
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
that any Municipal police vehicles
 
00:33:57.629 --> 00:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
purchased after January 1st of 2025 must
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
be marked if there they are to be used
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
for routine traffic Patrol this bill
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
does not prevent any undercovered
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
detective work or other necessary uses
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
of unmarked police vehicles this change
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
is not abnormal as similar legislation
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
has been passed in 17 States in
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
Washington DC data has IND indicated
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
over and over again that marked police
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles reduce traffic violations and
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
encourage safe driving if your priority
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
is more issued tickets sure keep things
 
00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919 align:start position:0%
the way they are but if your prior
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
priority is safer roads and fewer
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
traffic violations this bill is how we
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
get there I would ask my colleagues who
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
prioritize Public Safety and government
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
accountability to vote no on the
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
committee's itl motion so a better
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
motion can be made and so I can
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
introduce my floor Amendment thank you
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill clearly targets
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities only many of these
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal Police agencies operate within
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
limited number of unmarked cars and
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
resources in many cases officers fill
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
dual roles to include administrative
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
detectives in addition to patrol and
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
Enforcement this is an unfunded mandate
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
that would force all municipalities and
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
would possibly have a fiscal impact for
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
over 200 towns and 13 cities in New
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should we be micromanaging our
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies and
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities should we not allow
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
individual cities and towns to decide
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
what tools are best suited for their
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
individual Community
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
needs when we see an increase in traffic
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
collisions and fatal accidents will we
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
stand up and take responsibility or will
 
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
we point the finger at the police for
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
not enforcing laws after we handcuff
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
them this bill is very vague yet broad
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
it raises more questions than it should
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
to Be an Effective law for example would
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
this mean that if an unmarked police
 
00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle observes a traffic offense he or
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
she has lost the police Powers if they
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
observe a speeding vehicle must they let
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
go and if so the speeding vehicle causes
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
an accident strikes a pedestrian or
 
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise causes injury or death is the
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
officer municipality exempt from
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
liability what offenses are considered
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
traffic enforcement a majority of Motor
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
Vehicle violations are indicative of
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
driving under the
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
influence will we be asking police
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
officers to use a crystal ball to see if
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
an operator is under the influence prior
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
to initiating a motor vehicle stop and
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
making contact with the driver this bill
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
is silent on the definition of what
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
constitutes a traffic
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
law the US Department of Transportation
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
national highway safety commission tells
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
us that approximately 15,000 motor
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle related deaths occur annually on
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
our nation's roadways each year and
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
reducing speed is a high priority and
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
objective to effective speed enforcement
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
is essential to the countermeasure to
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
risks to that end the development
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive speed enforcement
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines for law enforcement a key
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
part of those guidelines includes the
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
use of both marked and unmarked police
 
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles in order for municipalities to
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
apply for and receive Federal grant
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
money for traffic enforcement there must
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
follow the guidelines if the bills were
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
to become law we would be passing an
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate cutting off their
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
access to Federal money and telling them
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
how best to keep their local communities
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
safe I have not heard one compelling
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
argument for not using unmarked police
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
cars for Motor Vehicle
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
Enforcement is the point of policing to
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
get citizens to the Bay of the laws only
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
when they feel there's an immediate
 
00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
police presence or all the
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
time will this bill serve the interest
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
of Public Safety or is it because some
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
of us don't like getting caught breaking
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
itl representative Muse has asked for a
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to ask this time it is

committee report of inexpedient to
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 1237 this is a
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
division vote chair recognizes
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
that the use of unmarked cars for
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
traffic enforcement can put drivers
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
especially female drivers in situations
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
where they are uncertain if a vehicle
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
pursuing them is an actual police
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle or an impostor and if I know
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
that numerous studies show that visible
 
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh that highly visible
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement reduces crime rates and
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
that marked Vehicles actually deter
 
00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
traffic violations and if I also know
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill has no immediate
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
financial impact because it doesn't take
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
effect until until January 1st
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
2025 then would I press the red button
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
to defeat the itl motion so another
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
motion can be made thank
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes representative Roy
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill only targets
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities and lets the state police
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
who have the most unmarked vehicles and
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
write the most tickets alone if I know
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
that this bill is properly debated in
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
the town halls where they have to
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
actually pay for the police cruisers and
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
if I further know that budgets for 2025
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
are being done now so it does have an
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
immediate effect on
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities and finally Mr Speaker if
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
I know that the state police actually
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
who are not involved in this spoke out
 
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.079 align:start position:0%
against it and said that it will hurt
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and the ability to stop
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
people from committing crimes would I
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
if I know that the members of the

committee agree that torture is horrible
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
and should be unlawful but I further
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
know that it's already unlawful and the
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee could not think
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
of one instance or thing that would be
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
considered torture that's not already
 
00:51:35.069 --> 00:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
illegal in this country and if I further
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
know that we don't make every single
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
thing a law that is already illegal for
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
example we don't have a law against
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
human sacrifice because it's murder
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
would I vote with the committee to keep

once said it's deja vu all over
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
again you may remember HB
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
1068 in the form of HB
 
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
342 just last year no we're going to
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
hear how HB 342 passed through the body
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
last year and that is true you'll also
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
hear that the other body on the other
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
side of this wall passed this this bill
 
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
last year also true but then it died on
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's desk this too is
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
true you'll hear this bill is merely a
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
checkbox for those families with kids
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
under the age of six when entering
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
school this is true too you will hear
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
that this that it is important to
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
discover lead poisoning in kids at an
 
00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:02.839 align:start position:0%
early age this is true
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
too what you won't hear is the
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
unintentional consequences such as
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
asking daycare centers in our public
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
schools to become the policy agent a
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
policing agency that is create that will
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
create extra hours to process the added
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
paperwork this bill will create also you
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
won't hear about the barrier this will
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
create for kids entering School
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
all this while we already have laws on
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
the books concerning blood
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
level blood Le level checking and
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
educating parents of children under the
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
age of
 
00:55:41.309 --> 00:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
six so we have the same bill the same
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
concerns this bill
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
creates the same house the same body on
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
the other side of this
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
wall and the same
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
Governor you might ask yourself is a
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
checkbook check box really necessary for
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
something we already address in other
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
laws just to see if we will receive
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
different results this
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
year join me in selecting the red button
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
so another motion can be made and Mr
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker I would like to request a div
 
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
division vote thank you Mr
 
00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
I I wasn't going to say all of that but
 
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
I agree with my colleague on much of it
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
what I need to say is this is not going
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
to result in an awful lot of extra
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
paperwork because it's just adding one
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
more line to paperwork that's already
 
00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:45.799 align:start position:0%
required about as we've
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
said a testing that is already
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
required the reason to bring it back is
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
that lead is still a terrible cognitive
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
and developmental danger to
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
children and the effects of lead
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
poisoning lead to increases that are
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
unnecessary in our school
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
budgets in addition to the fact of lives
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
that could have been made better
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
so what we are asking for is once again
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
to say the right thing to do is to add a
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
line to the form
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's not going to present any barriers
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
to entry because it's just informational
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
if the test has not been given nobody's
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
going to Bar people from
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
school so I ask you very from the bottom
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
of my heart for the children to do this
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.510 align:start position:0%
ownership of used vehicles to certain
um

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh what's it called tant also known as
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
cash assistant Ware
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
recipients um it would appropriate
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
$220,000 to be matched by federal funds
 
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh assumes the overhead to vendors
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
to be 10% leaving about 396,000 for
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle purchases at an estimated
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle the pursuit to help alleviate
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
the burdens of people financially
 
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
struggling is noble and I commend the
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill for their desire
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
to do good however there are some
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
reasons why this pilot program is not a
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
good idea first of all it's already been
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
done so it's not really a pilot program
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
um they had a program in this state and
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
it was discontinued and there are many
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
reasons why that may
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
be the used car market is incredibly
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
inflationary with limited inventory the
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
estimated cost for each used vehicle in
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
this program is very high even in an
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
inflated Market it's not clear that even
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
if a recipient can get off of
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
Transitional Assistance due to receiving
 
01:04:52.269 --> 01:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
a vehicle that the $20,000 the state
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
invested in the vehicle would be off
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
offset by the decrease in future
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
benefits that's one of the principal
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
arguments in favor of the bill
 
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
additionally there are logistical issues
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
with the bill concerning continuing
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance for the vehicles with used
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
cars there's always a likelihood of
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
unforeseen mechanical failure and issues
 
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
that can result in the vehicle becoming
 
01:05:15.269 --> 01:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
inoperable and requiring extensive cost
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
for repair if a person can't afford to
 
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
buy a used car is it certain they can
 
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
afford to continue with the maintenance
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
even if the vehicle is warrantied for a
 
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.589 align:start position:0%
even if the vehicle is warrantied for a
year

01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
every year used cars can cost thousands
 
01:05:29.269 --> 01:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
in repairs instead of making monthly
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
payments on brand new cars people who
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
have used cars are constantly paying to
 
01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.230 align:start position:0%
have used cars are constantly paying to
keep

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
keep
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
it there's also a limited ability to
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
detect and prevent fraud in this in this
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
proposed program as a recipient who
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
takes ownership of veic of a vehicle
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
through the through the program could
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
turn around and sell it they do take on
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
full ownership it's not clear that the
 
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
program is a wise investment for the
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
state due to the many logistical issues
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
it prevents for the government that's
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
charged with carefully handling taxpayer
 
01:05:59.069 --> 01:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
money programs like this are best left
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
to private Charities and private
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
donations the legislature like Charities
 
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
to their donors have a fiduciary duty to
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
the people there are currently charities
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that are doing this
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
wheels for wishes Helping Hands of
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
America and taking Take the Wheel New
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there are National
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
organizations that help also Charities
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
and businesses are working together to
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
meet these needs in the community
 
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
my friend is borrowing my car right now
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm in the Jeep today because she's got
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
the Honda uh our family only owns used
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
cars by the way and um the last month
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
the Jeep got a new starter new tires uh
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
we need that in the winter so we just
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
put it back on the road we took it off
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
cuz it needed repairs put it back on for
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
the winter um the Honda got tires last
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
year but it still needs a gauge cluster
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
which we're having a hard time finding
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
um all I can say is thank God my husband
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
is a mechanic because the costs to keep
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
our used cars would be even higher than
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
they already are so I don't see the
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
imperative for this bill it's not wise
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
and further I don't understand um why a
 
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
charity that's meant to help people
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
won't help people in New Hampshire
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
without this bill as one of the
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
Charities that um voiced their uh
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
support for the bill headset I don't
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
understand why certain
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um will offer charity without
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
State funding but others can't all of
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
this can be done in the private sector
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
with voluntar voluntarily donated funds
 
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
if we have organizations that are doing
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
this already the social workers at the
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
office of um Transitional Assistance
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
should be helping by referring to those
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
Charities that exist spill creates a
 
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
program that's not wise investment and I
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
ask that you would support um I ask that
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
you would vote against the ought to pass
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
motion and support so another motion can
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:08.920 align:start position:0%

investment and comes with complexities
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
that are Bel better dealt with in the

my kids to have have the right to
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
self-determination in these decisions I
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
want Granite Staters to know that their
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions are their own and
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
I want voters to weigh in on this
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
important issue we need to send this to
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%

01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:55.189 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.629 --> 01:21:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
that you know at some point there there
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
are Avenues to enforce rules I don't
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
think anybody's going to be particularly
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
happy if we start doing that so you can
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
necessary

01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative kab is recognized to
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr Speaker abortion is
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
currently legal in New Hampshire through
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
24 weeks and Beyond in in the case of
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
fetal fatal fetal abnormalities or when
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
the mother's life or health is at risk
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
polling data has made clear that the New
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire majority of New Hampshire
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
citizens are in favor of the law as it
 
01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
stands today this proposed cacr seeks to
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
make two big changes from the law as it
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
is today first it establishes that quote
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
every individual has a fundamental right
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
to abortion end quote every individual
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
is pretty ambiguous it could be
 
01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
interpreted to mean that everyone and
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
including the father could demand an
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
abortion simply because he didn't want
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
the woman he impregnated to have his
 
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
baby it could be further interpreted to
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
mean that a man also has a
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to an abortion and
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
let's say wisely that a hospital denies
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
that man an abortion does he then have
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
an equal protection claim against the
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
hospital this could be fixed by amending
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
to say every pregnant individual instead
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
secondly the resolution provides for
 
01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
abortion post 24 weeks when necessary it
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
is unspecific as to what necessary means
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
and would ensine a vague standard into
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
our constitution necessary could allow
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
an abortion to be performed right up
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
until birth simply because a woman
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
wanted one and a doctor felt it was
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
necessary to honor that wish there is no
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
need to put such a problematic CC a
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
constitution because abortion is already
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
legal in New Hampshire and women already
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
have the freedom and reproductive
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
Liberty to make these decisions with
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
their healthare
 
01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
providers so let's vote red on this and
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
wait until we can get the language right
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
and respect what the majority of New
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
you representative marjerie Smith has
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker I love this body I've been here
 
01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.070 align:start position:0%
Speaker I love this body I've been here
since

01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
1996 a long
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
time and I still love it I love being in
 
01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.229 align:start position:0%
time and I still love it I love being in
this

01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
room I love looking at all of your faces
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
I love seeing you age along with me and
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
I love seeing the young people
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
who have joined
 
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
us we
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
are the best legislature in the United
 
01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:37.719 align:start position:0%
States there are 400 of us we each
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
represent basically a handful of Voters
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
3,400 voters we go into the grocery
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
store and someone comes up to us and
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
says about such and such a bill what are
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
you thinking that doesn't happen in
 
01:25:55.679 --> 01:25:56.830 align:start position:0%
you thinking that doesn't happen in
other

01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:26:02.109 --> 01:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
states we come as close as you can to
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
having not a representative democracy
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
but a direct democracy I was sad when
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
durm voted to become an sb2 town because
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
I thought there was nothing better than
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
sitting in a gym and being able to see
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
all of the citizens of the
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
town talk about a particular issue and
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
that is something that I think is
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
incredibly important what does that have
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
to do with what we're talking about here
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
today I'm looking around and I will tell
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
you my baby is 54 years old it's been a
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
while since I have been involved
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
directly in the
 
01:26:55.719 --> 01:26:58.350 align:start position:0%
directly in the
reproduction

01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
reproduction
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
business and I'm happy for
 
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
that my my
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
grandchildren though are of an
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
age where this matters directly to them
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
but it's not only my grandchildren or
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
your grandchildren or your children or
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
you every one of us is affected in one
 
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
way or another
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
by how future Generations decide to
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
act for years this state was a
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
Libertarian State a a classic
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
libertarian state where we said the
 
01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
government should stay out of Private
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
Business and it is a time when this
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
legislature almost always in the control
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
of the Republican Party recognize that
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
and respect Ed personal privacy personal
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
privacy was
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
Central and we trust our
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
voters we saw just last week that
 
01:28:09.109 --> 01:28:09.119 align:start position:0%
contrary to all of the media reports an
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
incredible number of people turned out
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
to vote because in this state we take
 
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
seriously our
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
government I cannot think of an issue
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
that comes closer to affecting the lives
 
01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
of every single person in this state
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
than the issue that we have before us
 
01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
today in this Constitutional
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment up until the Supreme Court
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
acted several years ago we would not
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
have had to do this but the Supreme
 
01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
Court has said to each and every state
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
it is the state's
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
obligation to de side about issues of
 
01:28:58.109 --> 01:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights and if the state
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't take that
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility we're leaving a hole in
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
the fabric of our government and in this
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
state we have always believed that it
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
should be the people who decide 3,400 of
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
them elect
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
us we hear every bill that people want
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
us to to consider we do all of these
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
things we believe in limited government
 
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
in this state yes it is true that at the
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
moment there is
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
legislation on the books that says 24
 
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
weeks for an
 
01:29:45.109 --> 01:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
abortion and that is absolutely true but
 
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
we have several bills on the calendar
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
today that would change that and nothing
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
can stop stop us from getting a dozen
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
more next year and the year after and
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
the year after except one thing and that
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
is if we once and for all say that 400
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
of us cannot fit in a doctor's office we
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be there it should be the the
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
woman the person involved her family the
 
01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
people she chooses to invite into that
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
room and we should decide once and for
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
all that we have a lot of very important
 
01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
business in this state and we shouldn't
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
be wasting our time with trying to
 
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
intrude on people's private
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%

01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:43.000 align:start position:0%

interest of limited government and
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%

that the Senate will also pass the
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment and in November
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
we would send the issue to the voters
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
and let the people decide thank you very
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
the question before the house is the
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
motion of about to pass on
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
ca23 this being Constitutional Amendment
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution a vote of 3 fifths
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the membership of the house is
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
required for
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
passage representative Lynn is
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
if I know that because the current fetal
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
Life protection act enjoys widespread
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
public support among New Hampshire
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
citizens of all Stripes there simply is
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
no threat to abortion rights in this
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
state despite the NeverEnding political
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
rhetoric to the contrary and therefore
 
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
this proposed constitutional amendment
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
is totally unnecessary and if I know
 
01:33:56.109 --> 01:33:56.119 align:start position:0%
that the vague wording of this amendment
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
would allow abortions to be performed
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
virtually up to the moment of birth if a
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
woman for whatever reason felt that
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
abortion was quote unquote necessary and
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
could find a physician willing to bless
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
her decision and finally if I know that
 
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
the vague wording of this amendment
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
which grants the right to abortion to
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
anyone also carries the potential of
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
allowing a man who has impregnated a
 
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
woman to insist that
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
she abort the child even if she does not
 
01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
wish to do so in order for example for
 
01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
the man to avoid responsibility for pay
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
supporting the child then would I vote
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
no on this very ill-advised proposal by
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
pressing the red button thank you Mr
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%

01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
that Granite Staters value their
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
personal freedom and liberty Above All
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
Else and do not want the government
 
01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
involved in the most private medical
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
decisions they make with their doctors
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
and their loved ones and if I know that
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
the majority of granite Staters
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
consistently say that they want this
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
right which they had known for 50 years
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
explicitly restored to them in our
 
01:35:11.119 --> 01:35:12.270 align:start position:0%
explicitly restored to them in our
state's

01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
state's
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution and if I know the proposals
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
that we now see each year about new
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
abortion restrictions at 15 days or at
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
15 weeks cause great concern for women
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
and families in our state and that these
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
can be put to rest if we amend the
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution with this language
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
protecting the right to choose up to 24
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
weeks as it is in current law and
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that amending the
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
state's Constitution is not done by us
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
but by us simply choosing to send this
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
question to the voters where it has a
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
very high 2third threshold for
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%

01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
right to keep us out of their most
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%

01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
zero that is from a commission report of
 
01:40:35.199 --> 01:40:36.310 align:start position:0%
zero that is from a commission report of
this

01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
body 91a the Preamble for 91a States
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
openness in the conduct of public
 
01:40:48.189 --> 01:40:48.199 align:start position:0%
business is essential to a Democratic
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
Society and we are 49th in the country
 
01:40:54.669 --> 01:40:54.679 align:start position:0%
in regards to access to
 
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
information would this bill make us 50
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
we are only one point away from being
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
50 this bill is not the answer it limits
 
01:41:09.149 --> 01:41:09.159 align:start position:0%
freedom in particular Freedom of
 
01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
Information it will actually increase
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
litigation the people that might be
 
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
abusing the system will have another
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
claim of action against agencies they
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
can simply say the agency is improperly
 
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
asserting the amount of time it takes to
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
address a
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
request or it'll block someone
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
requesting something in good faith
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford or they don't
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
want to put the effort or cause trouble
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
by suing the agency to enforce the
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
statute this is an
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
overcorrection of the problem of
 
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
addressing a few bad
 
01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
actors now I want to bring your
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
attention to part of the 91a statute in
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
particular particular the portion titled
 
01:41:57.589 --> 01:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
remedies the court May award attorney's
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
fees to a public body or public agency
 
01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
or employee for having to defend against
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit under the provisions of this
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
statute of this chapter when the court
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
finds that the lawsuit is in bad faith
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
frivolous unjust wanted or
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
oppressive so there is already a
 
01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored solution to bad faith
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
and Bad actors in the
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
law that allows push back on actually
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
frivolous request and lawsuits but also
 
01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
allows good faith
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
request the statute itself is already
 
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:36.669 align:start position:0%
request the statute itself is already
the

01:42:36.669 --> 01:42:36.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
solution a judge can punish someone
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
abusing the system and they can also
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
vindicate a citizen for a violation of
 
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
91a this bill can only punish good faith
 
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
acting citizens because there's already
 
01:42:55.629 --> 01:42:55.639 align:start position:0%
a remedy for Bad
 
01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
actors we can only go one spot lower we
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
are 49th let's not become 50th let's
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
honor the Preamble of
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
91a openness in the conduct of public
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
business is essential to a Democratic
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
Speaker chair recognizer Senator Michael
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:34.990 align:start position:0%
Speaker chair recognizer Senator Michael
O'Brien

01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and good morning
 
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh as many of you know I do a
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
lot of things so wife will tell you I
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
think I do too much and I have to agree
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
with you but the thing is one of the
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
other jobs that I have is a vice
 
01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
president of the board of alderan in the
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
city of Nash but I'd like to keep my
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
comments away from nashor per se but we
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
can use that as the
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
example now the thing is NASA does not
 
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
want to limit any right of a citizen to
 
01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.950 align:start position:0%
want to limit any right of a citizen to
get

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
information we meticulously in nashille
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
have our meetings televised on closed
 
01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:26.030 align:start position:0%
have our meetings televised on closed
circuit

01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
TV people can turn in and they can see
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
it if you don't or if you missed the
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
meeting because you were busy or
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
something like that you can go to
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
channel 16 and see the meeting again
 
01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
because they
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
rebroadcast and I'll also tell you when
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
the dump is
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
open but the thing is
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's plenty of access to the
 
01:44:59.709 --> 01:44:59.719 align:start position:0%
information number two we
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
meticulously every uh minute or
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
everything that is discussed at an
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
automatic meeting and all meetings is
 
01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.589 align:start position:0%
automatic meeting and all meetings is
copied

01:45:11.589 --> 01:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
copied
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
verbatim verbatim if you were to look at
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
our particular uh meetings you can get
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
rece re a hard copy in
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
time of word for word of what was spoken
 
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
at the meetings now some communities
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
maybe perhaps yours takes a synopsis but
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
we don't we documented to the
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
tea and so with these things if anybody
 
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
wants information it's there but it
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
takes it may take some time to access
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
but particularly if something that was
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
spoken once and then several months have
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
gone by there's a lot of meetings in
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
nashwa I have a meeting just about when
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
we're in session just about two three
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
meetings a week between either being
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
Lea's on or my committees so the
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
information is out there but then I got
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
to bring up what would you
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
do if you had a
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
citizen who without benefit of an
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
election feels that they have been
 
01:46:34.589 --> 01:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
appointed by I don't know who the dog
 
01:46:38.669 --> 01:46:38.679 align:start position:0%
catcher or something like that but they
 
01:46:41.589 --> 01:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
are the people's
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
Watchdog and
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
demand access to every access to the you
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
know some of the things that happen at
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
the meetings in the in involved in 91a
 
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.030 align:start position:0%
the meetings in the in involved in 91a
we

01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
have but then it comes down to we have a
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
legal department and legals got a lot of
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
things on their mind there's zoning
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
things that we got to work on there's uh
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
others uh contracts that need to be
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
negotiated and signed and as it turned
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
out you say this has no impact on any
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
minp IP ality I assure you it does
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
Nashua had to go out and hire another
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I'm sure that lawyer is
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
getting you know what U you know makes
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
some the amount of what a lawyer makes
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
particularly one bit of information
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
leads into another bit of information
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
and some of this stuff is personal in
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
nature uh such as uh Personnel type of
 
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
issues and employees issues and is some
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
things that need to be
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
redacted so this takes time for legal to
 
01:48:07.589 --> 01:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
it so you say it has no impact to the
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
municipality it does I can
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
attest Mr Speaker that I can show you
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
documents of requests about this
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
thick of what was you know
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
supplied enough is enough particularly
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to do the research and
 
01:48:36.430 --> 01:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
spend the time and go through the
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
documents again we have a website many
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
your communities do as well too so
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
somebody can go through the
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
website but I want to end this in such a
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
way to let you know Nation Joshua
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
supports the right to know
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
law but when it comes
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
down when do we have the break point of
 
01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.229 align:start position:0%
down when do we have the break point of
too

01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
much and that's what I want you to
 
01:49:10.109 --> 01:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
consider in voting this the regular
 
01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
requests are fine but one is too much
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
too much now you
 
01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.790 align:start position:0%
too much now you
say

01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
$25 that's a little bit too much but
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
what happens to the
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
information if they go out and get a
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
lawyer and take you to court which has
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
happened that $25 fee gets rolled into
 
01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
if they win their Court decision so they
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
get it
 
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
back okay so it's not like it's not
 
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
missing or anything like that it's this
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
has the backing of the New Hampshire
 
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association not to shut or
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
shut down a person's
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry into what city government does
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
but it's trying to make it a little bit
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
more practical and again I feel like by
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
me getting up and as a representative of
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
Nashua speaking on this I just put a
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
Target on my back but this isn't the
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
first time I have you know but
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
I want you to leave you with this
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
thought as an alderman in the city of
 
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
nashwa I get paid
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
$5,000 a
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
year okay some might say that's a lot
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
but the amount of meetings that we go to
 
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
and everything my wife doesn't think
 
01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:42.910 align:start position:0%
and everything my wife doesn't think
it's

01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:50:46.149 --> 01:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
enough but the thing is do I want to go
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
to conquered
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
prison for violation of the the public
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
trust for
 
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
$5,000 I
 
01:50:57.310 --> 01:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
mean you do the
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
math okay I was born a nice Catholic kid
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to live with in the confines
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
of the law I am not going to get in
 
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
trouble because I feel I have dedicated
 
01:51:13.229 --> 01:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
my life to public
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
service so I'm asking you to stand with
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
us and support this bill because this
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't eliminate requests to the
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
91a all it does is the second and third
 
01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
when it gets over a certain amount of
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
time and that's when we need to address
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
the issue and maybe it makes the choices
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
of the requests far more practical than
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
just spouting off that we're going to
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
make the request and I thank you Mr
 
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker so therefore I urge you to
 
01:51:54.589 --> 01:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank

citizen that cannot

afford and the CH cannot afford the

subject of retrieving records person
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
number one might take 5 hours to
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
retrieve information and person number
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
two for whatever reason may take 11
 
01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
hours to retrieve the same
 
01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
information who
 
01:55:30.589 --> 01:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
determines an amount of estimate of time
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
to retrieve
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
information number three and this is
 
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
just this is just a
 
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
scenario and this could happen what if
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
the employee decides to take 11 hours
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
even though it doesn't take that long to
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
retrieve the information on Char and
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
charges is $25 an hour or
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
$275 and the recipient cannot afford to
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
pay that person is stripped of his right
 
01:56:03.550 --> 01:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
to know what is going on in his
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%

hearing heard testimony and the
 
01:56:16.589 --> 01:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
testimony mainly was on sizable requests
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
from commercial
 
01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.030 align:start position:0%

recipients

01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
recipients
 
01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
why does every person in New Hampshire
 
01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
suffer and pay high fees for right to
 
01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:30.629 align:start position:0%
suffer and pay high fees for right to
know

01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
information because of the problem
 
01:56:38.350 --> 01:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
between business and an uh public
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
entity I also understand that on
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
occasion a large request will be
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
made which is costly and the the person
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
never picks it up therefore it is costly
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:56:58.510 --> 01:56:58.520 align:start position:0%

attorney general who I understand is
 
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
updating the right to know memorandum
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
should become involved with logic and
 
01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
Common Sense and help solve the problems
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
rather than us passing house bill 1 oot
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%

of New

Hampshire there are many unanswered

questions regarding right to

all the municipalities is necessary to

ascertain the
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
answer is the Attorney General's
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
office involved to
 
01:59:44.109 --> 01:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
discuss and find Common Sense solutions

to the problems if not the Attorney
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
General's office in my opinion needs to
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
step up to the plate so to speak and
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
help solve the
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%

02:00:35.229 --> 02:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right to know requests how the
 
02:00:38.589 --> 02:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
way the people get to keep government
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
transparent in their
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
actions and the actions of the office
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
without right to know there would be no
 
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
way to keep government at all honest and
 
02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
transparent the citizens pay taxes to
 
02:00:57.310 --> 02:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
government and citizens have a right to
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
know how their money is spent and
 
02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
policies made with minimal charges to
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
the requested
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
information with House Bill
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
102 being able to charge up to $25 an
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
hour for retrieving
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
records if the time to retrieve exceeds
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
11 hours again is discrimination against
 
02:01:24.069 --> 02:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
people that cannot afford the
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
fee therefore their right to know what
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
is happening in government is
 
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.000 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
102 and Mr Speaker I request the
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
Lynn thank you Mr Speaker as amended
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
this bill allows governmental bodies to
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
recoup the costs of what are in in
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
effect extraordinary right to know
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
requests those that take over 10 hours
 
02:02:13.270 --> 02:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
to process and respond to this is
 
02:02:16.069 --> 02:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation governmental bodies
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
are not mandated to impose these charges
 
02:02:23.550 --> 02:02:23.560 align:start position:0%
costs allowed cannot exceed $25 per hour
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
o if once you go over 10 hours and
 
02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
charges imposed must be reasonable
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
reasonableness can be reviewed by the
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
right to no on budsman and ultimately by
 
02:02:34.679 --> 02:02:35.390 align:start position:0%
right to no on budsman and ultimately by
the

02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
court before costs can be charged under
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment the public body must
 
02:02:43.069 --> 02:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
articulate its policies so that the
 
02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
public knows up front what charges may
 
02:02:45.159 --> 02:02:46.109 align:start position:0%
public knows up front what charges may
be

02:02:46.109 --> 02:02:46.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
imposed approximately with with regard
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
to this the suggestion that somehow you
 
02:02:54.109 --> 02:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
know this bill is uh is kind of out of
 
02:02:58.510 --> 02:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
Step approximately 37 other states have
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
laws like this they have they impose
 
02:03:03.069 --> 02:03:03.079 align:start position:0%
condition costs in different different
 
02:03:05.069 --> 02:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
ways I'm not saying that ours is you
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
know there's uniformity but 37 other
 
02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:11.560 align:start position:0%
states have uh Provisions for imposing
 
02:03:15.149 --> 02:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
costs um so I submit there really is no
 
02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
substantial issue as to the court as to
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
the Bill's constitutionality part one
 
02:03:22.350 --> 02:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
article 8 of The Constitution does not
 
02:03:24.750 --> 02:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
confer the right to get any amount of
 
02:03:26.910 --> 02:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
records from the government for any
 
02:03:29.709 --> 02:03:29.719 align:start position:0%
reason at the cost of the taxpayer
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's the important thing here the fact
 
02:03:35.069 --> 02:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
that you have a right to certain records
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you have the right to
 
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
get them for free that's you know you
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
you have the right to travel under the
 
02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
that's a fundamental right under the
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
Constitution that doesn't mean the
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
government has to buy you a car or that
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
you can't be charged tolls on the the
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
road um it it's just that one doesn't
 
02:03:55.069 --> 02:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
follow from the
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
other the purpose of this uh bill is to
 
02:04:01.629 --> 02:04:01.639 align:start position:0%
avoid Shifting the costs of very large
 
02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
requests from the tax from the person or
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
company making the requests to the
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the municipality or the
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the state to the to ensure
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
that governmental bodies can receive at
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
least some compensation when their
 
02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
employees are distracted from their
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
regular duties to respond to such
 
02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:21.109 align:start position:0%
regular duties to respond to such
timeconsuming

02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
timeconsuming
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
requests the 10-hour threshold ensures
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
that for the vast majority of what I
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
would refer to as normal requests no
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
charges will be imposed most large
 
02:04:34.189 --> 02:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
record requests are from commercial
 
02:04:36.910 --> 02:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprises which can afford to pay and
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
will simply pass such costs on to their
 
02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
customers but our committee heard
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from local officials in a
 
02:04:46.589 --> 02:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
number of places throughout the state
 
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
that there are some requests that are
 
02:04:51.629 --> 02:04:51.639 align:start position:0%
abusive where people make the request
 
02:04:53.109 --> 02:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
not because they really want the
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
information but just to harass and
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
inconvenience the municipality because
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
they believe there's some conspiracy
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
going on or whatever um people make and
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
and as evidence of this probably the
 
02:05:08.669 --> 02:05:08.679 align:start position:0%
strongest we there was one witness I
 
02:05:11.229 --> 02:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
recall testifying that they literally in
 
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
this town they have a they have boxes
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
and boxes of of requests that people
 
02:05:18.990 --> 02:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
have where people made requests the
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
governmental body complied and nobody
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
ever bothered to pick them
 
02:05:25.549 --> 02:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
up um the last point I would make is you
 
02:05:28.149 --> 02:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
heard one of the prior speakers refer to
 
02:05:29.629 --> 02:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's a provision under
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
the under the rights of no law that
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
allows a governmental body to seek um to
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
seek uh costs and other remedies if if
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
there's an abusive request that's that
 
02:05:44.709 --> 02:05:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's there and it has it it you know
 
02:05:47.709 --> 02:05:47.719 align:start position:0%
it it it's not really much of a of an
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
effective remedy and and the reason for
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
that is this under the right to no
 
02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:56.679 align:start position:0%
law the person requesting doesn't have
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
to say why I want the information or
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do it what I'm going
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
to use it for or whatever they can
 
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
request you know they they they can
 
02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
basically say listen you know I have
 
02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
trouble sleeping at night so I want I
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
want to know the date of birth of every
 
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
person that was married in New Hampshire
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
over the last 50 years you and I might
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
think that's crazy what why but that you
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
can't ask that question why do I why do
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
you want the information so it's very
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
very difficult to S to to to to um to
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
enforce the idea that something is
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
abusive because they they on what
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
grounds on what grounds is it abusive I
 
02:06:40.030 --> 02:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
I want this I want these records it's
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a lot of Records but so what
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's my right I want the
 
02:06:47.950 --> 02:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
records this requires in in what in in
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
circumstance where there's an
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinary request this requires that
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
the person have at least some skin in
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
the game and I think that in these
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances that's really
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate um so I for all of those
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
reasons I believe that this is a this is
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
a entirely appropriate bill that will
 
02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
address the problems that we that that
 
02:07:16.510 --> 02:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh have been uh have been identified and
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
will not have the will not require us
 
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
all of us taxpayers to Bear the burden
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
in these situations and I think that's
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
entirely appropriate uh you you can get
 
02:07:31.470 --> 02:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
the information but at at a certain
 
02:07:33.310 --> 02:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
point you got to have some skin in the
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
game you got to pay for it for those
 
02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
reasons I ask you to support the OTP
 
02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:40.520 align:start position:0%

02:09:46.109 --> 02:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
succeed if I know Mr Speaker that this
 
02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
bill would severely
 
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
harm government accountability and
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
transparency in New
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%

right to know

Hampshire and if I
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
know that the right to know law is an
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly useful tool in identifying
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
systemic government abuse it has exposed
 
02:10:36.750 --> 02:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
police misconduct how various agencies
 
02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
regulate how our laws are enforced and
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
how we are
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
taxed and if I know that this bill will
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
give government agencies a significant
 
02:10:50.589 --> 02:10:50.599 align:start position:0%
tool to obstruct providing this Vital
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
Information to taxpayers who should not
 
02:10:57.310 --> 02:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
have to pay for either an agency's
 
02:11:01.149 --> 02:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
overzealous attempts to keep information
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
secret or the agency's poor document
 
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
management policies and lastly if I know
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
the committee did not consider more
 
02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
targeted proposals that could limit
 
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
excessive requests without deterring the
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents from making
 
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable requests for documents and
 
02:11:25.629 --> 02:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
there are already
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in New Hampshire law that
 
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
check against frivolous requests when
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
the court finds that the lawsuit is in
 
02:11:39.149 --> 02:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
bad faith frivolous unjust vexatious
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
wanting I don't know about that word or
 
02:11:45.390 --> 02:11:45.400 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:10.599 align:start position:0%
if I know from my long experience on the
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
select board that people in companies
 
02:12:14.669 --> 02:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes take advantage of the right to
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%

02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:18.669 align:start position:0%

expeditions
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
and if I know that those fishing
 
02:12:22.350 --> 02:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
Expeditions take Municipal Employees
 
02:12:25.390 --> 02:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
away from their assigned tasks and cost
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers significant dollars and if I
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
know that the Attorney General's office
 
02:12:33.149 --> 02:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
stated that the implementation of a
 
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee system for large right to
 
02:12:39.149 --> 02:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
no requests supports the spirit and
 
02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of the right to know law and our
 
02:12:43.549 --> 02:12:43.559 align:start position:0%
state's Constitution's principle of
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable access to governmental
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
records and if I know know that the data
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
gathered by the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:12:52.549 --> 02:12:52.559 align:start position:0%
Association that this bill will only
 
02:12:55.709 --> 02:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
provide a local option that would only
 
02:12:58.549 --> 02:12:58.559 align:start position:0%
affect large requests and help provide a
 
02:13:01.229 --> 02:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
mechanism for municipalities to uh and
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
requesters to collaborate and if I know
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill eliminates surprise fees
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
provides a mechanism to appeal the right
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
to know Ombudsman and the right to no
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
law already provides for a no filing fee
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%

weatherization programs the New
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves program run through the
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
utilities and the weatherization
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
assistance program run through the
 
03:53:15.070 --> 03:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy together these two
 
03:53:17.550 --> 03:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
programs weatherize approximately a
 
03:53:19.950 --> 03:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
th000 homes per year a drop in the
 
03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
bucket of the current need quantifiable
 
03:53:24.429 --> 03:53:24.439 align:start position:0%
only to the extent that project
 
03:53:26.590 --> 03:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
proposals far outweigh the budgets for
 
03:53:29.269 --> 03:53:29.279 align:start position:0%
these programs year after year without
 
03:53:31.750 --> 03:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
fail what is the current need of
 
03:53:34.269 --> 03:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
weatherization where is it needed
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
exactly we don't have a clear picture
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
other than it's large
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
solving the problem of weatherization of
 
03:53:44.309 --> 03:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
homes is crucial to solving the larger
 
03:53:46.590 --> 03:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
housing crisis in our
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
state the benefits of having an
 
03:53:50.710 --> 03:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
adequately winterized home should be
 
03:53:53.309 --> 03:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
obvious to everyone here it makes a
 
03:53:55.110 --> 03:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
difference in the lives of our
 
03:53:57.510 --> 03:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
constituents who are the most likely
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
people to be living in inadequately
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
weatherized homes they are your
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
neighbors people with disabilities
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
single parent households Black and
 
03:54:08.510 --> 03:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hispanic families the most likely people
 
03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
to be living in substandard housing
 
03:54:12.510 --> 03:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
every community in our state has a good
 
03:54:15.110 --> 03:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
share of housing stock whose residents
 
03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
are paying over and above what they
 
03:54:20.510 --> 03:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
should to keep warm this hurts all of us
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire saves program
 
03:54:24.510 --> 03:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
estimates that it adds $3 to the local
 
03:54:26.830 --> 03:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
economy for every dollar invested in
 
03:54:26.840 --> 03:54:27.830 align:start position:0%
economy for every dollar invested in
their

03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
programs and no matter what accounting
 
03:54:32.110 --> 03:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
you use improving the quality of life
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
for our constituents is why we are
 
03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
buttons figuring out ways to collect the
 
03:54:41.950 --> 03:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
data that we need assessing the programs
 
03:54:44.309 --> 03:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
and policies currently in place
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
especially given the large amount of
 
03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
federal dollars coming our
 
03:54:51.030 --> 03:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
way Gathering input from stakeholders
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
these are all the first steps to getting
 
03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
a handle on a crucial aspect of our
 
03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
housing crisis or we could look the
 
03:54:58.750 --> 03:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
other way and congratulate ourselves on
 
03:55:01.550 --> 03:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
doing what we do best sometimes it seems
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
count on things to take care of
 
03:55:05.349 --> 03:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
themselves and rely on the resilience
 
03:55:07.389 --> 03:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
for which Granite Staters are
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
famous I get study committees are just
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
not that
 
03:55:14.070 --> 03:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
exciting but having one can be the
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
jumping off point for getting something
 
03:55:19.309 --> 03:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
big done where a big job is needed when
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
I saw that this Bill had nine
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors in this house and three
 
03:55:25.510 --> 03:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
across the wall I thought well there you
 
03:55:27.870 --> 03:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
go there's two committees right
 
03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
there three representatives and one
 
03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
Senator meeting for less than a year to
 
03:55:35.189 --> 03:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
take to make a report doesn't seem like
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
a big ask put me down for one of the
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:39.710 align:start position:0%
a big ask put me down for one of the
spots

03:55:39.710 --> 03:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
spots
 
03:55:41.830 --> 03:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
so if you think that assessing existing
 
03:55:43.269 --> 03:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
programs and data collection on
 
03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
weatherization is an important task of
 
03:55:47.670 --> 03:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
oversight which properly belongs to the
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislature if you think that helping to
 
03:55:52.790 --> 03:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
fix our housing crisis helping stop
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
waste and unnecessary pollution
 
03:55:56.710 --> 03:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
improving local economies and helping
 
03:55:59.229 --> 03:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
families live better quality lives are
 
03:56:01.790 --> 03:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
all things your constituents appreciate
 
03:56:04.429 --> 03:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
then please vote against the itl motion
 
03:56:06.830 --> 03:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
so that a better motion can be made and
 
03:56:08.469 --> 03:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
I request a division vote Mr speaker
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:56:13.990 --> 03:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:17.070 --> 03:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
Harington thank you Mr Speaker so let's
 
03:56:18.349 --> 03:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
take a little look at this bill and see
 
03:56:21.070 --> 03:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
what it actually does as stated it has
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
four members on it so these four members
 
03:56:25.149 --> 03:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
are going to have a lot of work to do
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
starts out by saying quote identifying
 
03:56:29.269 --> 03:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
the current state of weatherization in
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
our state including the number of homes
 
03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
that are properly weatherized and those
 
03:56:36.309 --> 03:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
that are not the department of energy in
 
03:56:38.670 --> 03:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
their testimony said the department is
 
03:56:40.349 --> 03:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
unable to identify the number of homes
 
03:56:42.630 --> 03:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that are not are or
 
03:56:44.469 --> 03:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
not weatherized New Hampshire does not
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
maintain any type of database that
 
03:56:47.630 --> 03:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
tracks residential homeowner
 
03:56:49.550 --> 03:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
installation of a given energy
 
03:56:52.710 --> 03:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
conservation measures so the entire
 
03:56:55.149 --> 03:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
department of energy can't do what these
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
four members of this committee are going
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
to do Mr Speaker if this is passed in
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
committee it goes on to say that they're
 
03:57:10.269 --> 03:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
going to look at comprehensive set of
 
03:57:12.670 --> 03:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations and incentives to
 
03:57:14.950 --> 03:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
weatherize weatherization efforts in our
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
state well what that basically means is
 
03:57:18.910 --> 03:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
how can we figure out a way to get more
 
03:57:20.349 --> 03:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
money out of the rate payers and the
 
03:57:22.110 --> 03:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to give to someone in a
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
weather rise their house it doesn't
 
03:57:26.269 --> 03:57:26.279 align:start position:0%
mention anything about con cost
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness whether these should be
 
03:57:30.070 --> 03:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
cost beneficial measures that just says
 
03:57:31.750 --> 03:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to spend other
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
people's money and it doesn't also
 
03:57:36.070 --> 03:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
mention that there's huge amounts of
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
money being spent by the state right now
 
03:57:40.910 --> 03:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
we got a massive Grant from the federal
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
government under the
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
weatherization weatherization assistance
 
03:57:46.990 --> 03:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
program this past year uh I think it was
 
03:57:49.950 --> 03:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
$18 million uh through the New Hampshire
 
03:57:53.309 --> 03:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
saves program we spend tens of millions
 
03:57:55.229 --> 03:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
of dollars a year on Energy Efficiency
 
03:57:57.429 --> 03:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
and weatherization and in fact New
 
03:57:59.309 --> 03:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is ranked in one of the in the
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
top states in the country as far as
 
03:58:05.189 --> 03:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
dollars spent per capita on Energy
 
03:58:08.030 --> 03:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and weatherization so in
 
03:58:10.670 --> 03:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
summary we have a study committee that's
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
impossible to do their task because the
 
03:58:14.429 --> 03:58:14.439 align:start position:0%
whole department of energy says they
 
03:58:15.790 --> 03:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
can't do it so certainly four
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
individuals can't it has no mention of
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
being cost effective let's just go spend
 
03:58:22.110 --> 03:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
other people's money and it doesn't
 
03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
discuss the fact that we already have
 
03:58:25.830 --> 03:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
multiple programs in effect to take care
 
03:58:28.110 --> 03:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
of weatherization of private housing so
 
03:58:30.110 --> 03:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
please join me in voting in favor of the
 
03:58:30.120 --> 03:58:37.510 align:start position:0%
please join me in voting in favor of the
itl

03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:37.520 --> 03:58:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
motion

03:58:41.990 --> 03:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.950 --> 03:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative cap Kaplan has asked for
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:57.229 --> 03:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:59.790 --> 03:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
there this will be a division vote
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.439 --> 03:59:37.429 align:start position:0%

03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:39.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

yeah
 
03:59:42.309 --> 03:59:42.319 align:start position:0%

03:59:57.149 --> 03:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
inquiry if I know that helping to fix
 
04:00:00.110 --> 04:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis starts with Gathering
 
04:00:03.269 --> 04:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
data and stakeholder input and assessing
 
04:00:03.279 --> 04:00:05.389 align:start position:0%
data and stakeholder input and assessing
current

04:00:05.389 --> 04:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
current

and bringing our existing housing stop
 
04:00:12.469 --> 04:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
stock up to standard in terms of
 
04:00:14.990 --> 04:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
weatherization and insulation is crucial
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
in our tight housing
 
04:00:20.269 --> 04:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
market if I know that economic growth in
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
our state can only happen if we can
 
04:00:23.790 --> 04:00:23.800 align:start position:0%

Bernardi thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to
 
04:05:55.149 --> 04:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
support this amendment and let me just
 
04:05:57.870 --> 04:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
read it for you it's very simple neither
 
04:06:01.229 --> 04:06:01.239 align:start position:0%
slavery nor involuntary servit servitude
 
04:06:04.750 --> 04:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
except as punishment for a crime whereas
 
04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
the party shall have been duly convicted
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
shall exist in the state of New
 
04:06:12.910 --> 04:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or any other place subject to
 
04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
its jurisdiction now you may recall that
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
this language is identical to the 13th
 
04:06:20.670 --> 04:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the United States
 
04:06:23.710 --> 04:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution except substituting New
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for United
 
04:06:31.149 --> 04:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
States adopting this identical language
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
and having having this hearing on this
 
04:06:38.030 --> 04:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
bill helps tie us to the historical
 
04:06:41.429 --> 04:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
precedent of all the past cases where
 
04:06:44.550 --> 04:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
this where this issue was litigated most
 
04:06:47.229 --> 04:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
particularly the issue involuntary
 
04:06:49.630 --> 04:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
servitude I'd just like to digress for
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
one moment to talk about the 13th
 
04:06:55.149 --> 04:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment and how it was
 
04:06:58.269 --> 04:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
passed in the Senate the vote was
 
04:07:01.469 --> 04:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
38-6 all the Republicans and only two
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
Democrats voted for it in the house the
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
vote was 119 to 56 all the Republicans
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
and 14 Democrats voted for it I'm hoping
 
04:07:16.030 --> 04:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
that we'll have a broader bipartisan
 
04:07:19.229 --> 04:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
response to this particular
 
04:07:22.149 --> 04:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
version it was submitted to ratification
 
04:07:24.990 --> 04:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
on the 1st of February
 
04:07:29.070 --> 04:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
159 years ago today it's the only
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that was signed by the
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
president President Lincoln signed it
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
before he sent it out New Hampshire was
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
the 23rd of the 27 States required to
 
04:07:38.560 --> 04:07:40.510 align:start position:0%
the 23rd of the 27 States required to
ratify

04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
ratify
 
04:07:43.870 --> 04:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
it it makes sense to adopt this because
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's parallel language to the US
 
04:07:50.349 --> 04:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment and that again
 
04:07:53.830 --> 04:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
carries in all the history of all the
 
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
litigation and all the hearings that
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
have been conducted on this subject if
 
04:08:01.710 --> 04:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
we just adopt the current version that's
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
been proposed we're starting as if it
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
was from Ground
 
04:08:06.640 --> 04:08:08.590 align:start position:0%
was from Ground
Zero

04:08:08.590 --> 04:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
Zero
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
now you may ask
 
04:08:13.870 --> 04:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
why would we want to do
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
that you
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
know we all know the Claremont case was
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
decided by the meaning of the word
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
charity written in our constitution from
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
1784 excuse me cherish not
 
04:08:31.439 --> 04:08:33.109 align:start position:0%
1784 excuse me cherish not
charity

04:08:33.109 --> 04:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
charity
 
04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
so what we see is evidence that
 
04:08:41.109 --> 04:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
historical precedent historical language
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
is looked at by the courts when they
 
04:08:47.950 --> 04:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
examine the meaning of a particularly
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment most
 
04:08:58.189 --> 04:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
importantly the issue involuntary
 
04:09:02.349 --> 04:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
servitude was raised in the dobs
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
decision invol pregnancy being carried
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
to full term was proposed to be
 
04:09:08.199 --> 04:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
to full term was proposed to be
involuntary

04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
involuntary
 
04:09:14.309 --> 04:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
servitude the court rejected that
 
04:09:18.349 --> 04:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
finding we bring that history into our
 
04:09:21.309 --> 04:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
decision today if we adopt the full
 
04:09:25.389 --> 04:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
language as it is proposed in this
 
04:09:29.229 --> 04:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that same logic of
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
having uh pregnancy be considered
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude in my mind is
 
04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
similar to saying parents are invol
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
voluntary servants to their children
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
until the age of 18 this is just not
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
logical yet it is out there and it is a
 
04:09:48.670 --> 04:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
case that people are talking about
 
04:09:48.680 --> 04:09:49.750 align:start position:0%
case that people are talking about
bringing

04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
bringing
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
forward so I urge
 
04:09:55.950 --> 04:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
bipartisan passage of this amendment I'd
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
like to see everyone vote for
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
elimination or Banning of both slavery
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
and involuntary servitude in New
 
04:10:06.590 --> 04:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Mr Speaker does a
 
04:10:10.030 --> 04:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%

04:10:13.040 --> 04:10:18.189 align:start position:0%

representative

04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:23.070 --> 04:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
colleagues9 years ago to the
 
04:10:29.469 --> 04:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
day we had the debate in the United
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
States Congress around the issue of
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
slavery 159 years ago to the day January
 
04:10:38.239 --> 04:10:39.990 align:start position:0%
slavery 159 years ago to the day January
31st

04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
31st
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
1965 and I think it is precient that we
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
are here today discussing this same
 
04:10:49.790 --> 04:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
debate having the same debate that they
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
had in
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
1865 the debate before us is whether or
 
04:10:58.389 --> 04:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
not to approve this amendment and I'd
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
just like to speak for a second about
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
that the state and federal Relations
 
04:11:05.109 --> 04:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
Committee approved the language of the
 
04:11:08.070 --> 04:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
original Bill 20 to Z and there were
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
some concerns brought up by the chairman
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
around prisons and what the position of
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner the commissioner of our
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
prisons and what their position would be
 
04:11:22.030 --> 04:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
about this legislation they came and
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
offered a letter in support of the bill
 
04:11:28.990 --> 04:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
as it stood originally and that was
 
04:11:31.109 --> 04:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
because commissioner Hanks the
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner of our prisons and
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves understand that slavery is a
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
moral wrong
 
04:11:40.750 --> 04:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's an excuse uh for something that
 
04:11:43.469 --> 04:11:43.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist anymore and folks this
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
is a tough issue and and all of us here
 
04:11:49.389 --> 04:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
you know think I think some of us might
 
04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
think that this issue has already been
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
solved uh but I would like to to posit
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
that and the hearing for this bill
 
04:11:58.030 --> 04:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
happened on National human trafficking
 
04:11:59.790 --> 04:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
awareness day and I and I think that was
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
another one of the coincidences in this
 
04:12:05.070 --> 04:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
bill which point to support there are
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
1.1 million people in the United States
 
04:12:10.349 --> 04:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
right now who are classified as being
 
04:12:14.469 --> 04:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
slaved uh enslaved in either sexual
 
04:12:17.710 --> 04:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
servitude enforced Labor uh human
 
04:12:20.229 --> 04:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
traffic 1.1 million people is the
 
04:12:21.750 --> 04:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
estimate of how many people right now in
 
04:12:23.950 --> 04:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
the United States are enslaved and
 
04:12:25.510 --> 04:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's why there are days like human
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
trafficking awareness day that's why we
 
04:12:29.469 --> 04:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
care so much about human trafficking
 
04:12:31.109 --> 04:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
because this has been recognized as an
 
04:12:34.030 --> 04:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
issue that is a moreal wrong so the
 
04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
amendment here before us today would re
 
04:12:39.070 --> 04:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
authorize the same language that's
 
04:12:41.550 --> 04:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
currently in the United States
 
04:12:43.750 --> 04:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution's 13th Amendment the
 
04:12:46.269 --> 04:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
problem with that language is it leaves
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
there an excuse for slavery and in my
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
opinion as someone a student of History
 
04:12:56.510 --> 04:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh there should not be any exemption for
 
04:13:00.910 --> 04:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
slavery uh slavery in any form is wrong
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
and commissioner Hanks agrees with that
 
04:13:05.790 --> 04:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
the 20 members of the committee agreed
 
04:13:07.630 --> 04:13:07.640 align:start position:0%
with that when you have an issue where
 
04:13:09.910 --> 04:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
the Liberty Alliance and left-wing
 
04:13:11.950 --> 04:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
activists are together on the same issue
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
and then you have some centralists in
 
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
the same who are on the same issue I
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
think that's an issue that's worth
 
04:13:19.109 --> 04:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
supporting because people on all sides
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
the on the aisle whether wherever you
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
fall on the economic spectrum or the
 
04:13:26.710 --> 04:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
social Spectrum agree that servitude
 
04:13:29.109 --> 04:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude for another is a
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
moral wrong and as we stand here 159
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
years ago to the day of when the
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
Congress of the United States debated
 
04:13:40.910 --> 04:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment as I stand under Abraham
 
04:13:44.309 --> 04:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
Lincoln who helped pass this amendment
 
04:13:46.830 --> 04:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
and saved our Union in that moment and
 
04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
as I sit in my seat as someone who would
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
not have been allowed in this
 
04:13:55.349 --> 04:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
building not that long ago within some
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
of our lifetimes here I think for me
 
04:14:00.830 --> 04:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
this is one of those legisl this is a
 
04:14:03.550 --> 04:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that's clear to support and
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
I understand the concerns that were
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
brought forward but I have to say that
 
04:14:10.469 --> 04:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is an important thing
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
and the legislative intent of the
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
committee had nothing to do with the
 
04:14:16.990 --> 04:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
other things that were brought up by my
 
04:14:19.510 --> 04:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
friend at the other Das the legislative
 
04:14:22.189 --> 04:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
intent of the committee had to do with
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
abolishing slavery once and for all so
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
this didn't have to do with abortion
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
this didn't have to do with any other
 
04:14:30.429 --> 04:14:30.439 align:start position:0%
issue other than slavery and and I think
 
04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
trying to dilute it by bringing up those
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
other issues does this let legislation
 
04:14:37.520 --> 04:14:38.229 align:start position:0%
other issues does this let legislation
of

04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
disservice so my friends colleagues I
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
would ask you again just as the United
 
04:14:49.830 --> 04:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
States Congress did 159 years ago to
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
vote against this amendment and vote for
 
04:14:55.950 --> 04:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
the bill as ought to pass because
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
slavery is a moral wrong all of us in
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
this building understand that and there
 
04:15:04.830 --> 04:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
is no exception to that so thank you
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
very much so Mr Speaker and I app
 
04:15:09.149 --> 04:15:09.159 align:start position:0%

04:25:31.990 --> 04:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
of military personnel and even calling
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
up the inactive reserve to fill gaps in
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
the ongoing Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
and this this was the last Stitch effort
 
04:25:43.469 --> 04:25:43.479 align:start position:0%
to bolster ranks before enacting a draft
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
some on the left called it a backdoor
 
04:25:47.630 --> 04:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
draft at the
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
time and this is when recruitment was at
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
an all-time high after the spike of
 
04:25:54.429 --> 04:25:54.439 align:start position:0%
patriotism and voluntary enlistment
 
04:25:57.389 --> 04:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
following 9911 we're currently
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing record lows in Recruitment
 
04:26:00.560 --> 04:26:01.389 align:start position:0%
experiencing record lows in Recruitment
and

04:26:01.389 --> 04:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:04.670 --> 04:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
Retention so now we're poised with the
 
04:26:06.510 --> 04:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
media and leaders from both sides of the
 
04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
warmongering uni party readying us for
 
04:26:12.910 --> 04:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
hot conflicts the world
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
over we don't have the numbers to fight
 
04:26:18.990 --> 04:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
any prolonged War so a draft will be
 
04:26:21.109 --> 04:26:21.119 align:start position:0%
necessary and while the state cannot
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
openly oppose the draft we do not have
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
to help them punish those that do we can
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
signal to DC that Granite Staters do not
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
support another bloody Forever War and
 
04:26:33.550 --> 04:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
especially utilizing conscription to
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%

04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
registration some concerns the committee
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
had about HB
 
04:27:06.630 --> 04:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
1338 were
 
04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
the conscientious objector checkbox on a
 
04:27:12.550 --> 04:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
driver's license application and the
 
04:27:15.149 --> 04:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
section that dealt with prohibiting the
 
04:27:18.070 --> 04:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
state from cooperating with federal
 
04:27:21.149 --> 04:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
government laws or an executive order to
 
04:27:24.030 --> 04:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
assist federal law
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement in regards to the con
 
04:27:29.550 --> 04:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector box the committee
 
04:27:32.189 --> 04:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
felt it would mislead an applicant to
 
04:27:35.870 --> 04:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
think that with a flick of the pen the
 
04:27:38.990 --> 04:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
appc could achieve conscientious
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
objective status when actually the
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
process is longer and much more
 
04:27:49.429 --> 04:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
involved the other concern mentioned
 
04:27:52.109 --> 04:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
involved eliminating New Hampshire from
 
04:27:54.349 --> 04:27:54.359 align:start position:0%

04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%

Act if this bill were to pass the loss
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
to the state could be Federal funding
 
04:28:06.910 --> 04:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
while the affected IND individuals could
 
04:28:09.830 --> 04:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
experience eligibility difficulties when
 
04:28:12.389 --> 04:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
applying for executive branch jobs or

04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
the government uses the first two levels
 
04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
of its total military force namely

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
if I know we shouldn't punish people and
 
04:30:37.109 --> 04:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
prevent them from going to College just
 
04:30:38.670 --> 04:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
because they are
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
anti-war and if I also know that given
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
the way things are going in the world
 
04:30:46.109 --> 04:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
right now War very well may be on the
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
horizon and given the war fatigue in
 
04:30:51.109 --> 04:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
this country that that means that a
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
draft is all but certain and lastly Mr
 
04:30:57.389 --> 04:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that is almost always
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
the poor that are sent to kill and die
 
04:31:04.149 --> 04:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
and not the fortunate sons who get
 
04:31:06.309 --> 04:31:06.319 align:start position:0%

04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
news look across this country and what's
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
happening in
 
04:34:36.869 --> 04:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
Texas as of right right now the governor
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
of Texas has invoked the Constitutional
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
provision on
 
04:34:45.551 --> 04:34:45.561 align:start position:0%
Invasion and activated his State
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
National Guard to defend the state of
 
04:34:52.029 --> 04:34:52.039 align:start position:0%
Texas per the Governor from
 
04:34:54.269 --> 04:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
Invasion there is already
 
04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
talk in a number of different circles
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
from leaders of this country of
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
federalizing the National Guard to
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
remove the power of the Guard from the
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
governor of Texas now this act this this
 
04:35:10.510 --> 04:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh resolution is not about what's going
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
on in Texas right now but this is the
 
04:35:17.310 --> 04:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
concept behind it in our system states
 
04:35:20.189 --> 04:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
are the Dual sovereign states have the
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
same sovereignty that the federal
 
04:35:24.189 --> 04:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
government enjoys and under the
 
04:35:27.070 --> 04:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
definition of sovereignty you will find
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
gets to have their own military
 
04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
service this is a resolution about the
 
04:35:37.269 --> 04:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
state militia the state guard in
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
particular when
 
04:35:43.470 --> 04:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
Florida attempted to staff their state
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
guard they came under attack they were
 
04:35:49.709 --> 04:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
threatened they were told that they
 
04:35:51.349 --> 04:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
should not be doing this it was
 
04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
advertised as if it was some sort of a
 
04:35:56.109 --> 04:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
some sort of a vigilante thing but it's
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's under State Control it's under the
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
control of the Governor New Hampshire
 
04:36:03.910 --> 04:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
also has this same concept in law a
 
04:36:06.310 --> 04:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
state guard it ex exists it's already
 
04:36:08.830 --> 04:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
there and if the day comes that we ever
 
04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
need to staff it we can expect the same
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
fight and the same threats that Florida
 
04:36:16.910 --> 04:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
experienced when they tried to staff
 
04:36:18.990 --> 04:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
theirs it has gotten to the point that
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government is treating the
 
04:36:24.189 --> 04:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
states as if they don't have the right
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
to their own militaries under State
 
04:36:29.551 --> 04:36:29.561 align:start position:0%
control that's why I have drafted this
 
04:36:31.750 --> 04:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
we need to send a signal that we will
 
04:36:35.551 --> 04:36:35.561 align:start position:0%
not accept being a lesser power we are
 
04:36:37.869 --> 04:36:37.879 align:start position:0%
not thank
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%

04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:39:09.869 --> 04:39:09.879 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire Constitution part 1
 
04:39:12.990 --> 04:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
articles 25 and 24 as well as the Second
 
04:39:14.189 --> 04:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the United States
 
04:39:16.150 --> 04:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution outlined that an
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
well-trained militia is a proper natural
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
and sure defense of a state and if I
 
04:39:23.789 --> 04:39:23.799 align:start position:0%
know that RSA chapter 111 defines that
 
04:39:26.230 --> 04:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
state militia as consisting of all
 
04:39:28.510 --> 04:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
able-bodied and willing people not

currently enlisted in the US or state
 
04:39:33.109 --> 04:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
military and finally if I know that
 
04:39:35.551 --> 04:39:35.561 align:start position:0%
bills were filed in DC this year year to
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
infringe upon these fundamental
 
04:39:39.470 --> 04:39:39.480 align:start position:0%

04:40:06.910 --> 04:40:06.920 align:start position:0%

04:42:57.868 --> 04:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
to our vehicle inspection laws basically
 
04:43:00.270 --> 04:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
it's easier just to give an example it
 
04:43:02.910 --> 04:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
lets you if you buy a new vehicle go two
 
04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
years without an inspection so I was
 
04:43:07.230 --> 04:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
born in March if I go out today to
 
04:43:08.788 --> 04:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
celebrate this bill passing and buy a
 
04:43:12.868 --> 04:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
new car um in March of 2026 I would have
 
04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
to get it inspected for the first time
 
04:43:16.910 --> 04:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
so uh couple issues with this bill and
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
this is the things that most of the
 
04:43:19.628 --> 04:43:19.638 align:start position:0%
opponents are going to bring up is the
 
04:43:23.310 --> 04:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
safety of vehicle inspections
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
so I looked around for data and believe
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
it or not it's kind of hard to find data
 
04:43:33.310 --> 04:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
on vehicle inspections and the effect
 
04:43:35.550 --> 04:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
they have on the safety of our roadways
 
04:43:37.628 --> 04:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
and I found a government accountability
 
04:43:39.910 --> 04:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
office report that had a bunch of
 
04:43:43.550 --> 04:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
studies kind of all melded together and
 
04:43:46.590 --> 04:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
when I looked at that report every study
 
04:43:48.150 --> 04:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
and this is five or six studies from all
 
04:43:50.948 --> 04:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
over the world actually it concluded
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
that there is no Advantage no safety
 
04:43:56.750 --> 04:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
advantage that we get from vehicle
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
inspections um and this report was done
 
04:44:03.910 --> 04:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
on all cars so this bill is only on
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
brand new new cars so that's very
 
04:44:07.628 --> 04:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
important to keep in mind we're talking
 
04:44:10.510 --> 04:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
about a very small sliver of cars and
 
04:44:12.190 --> 04:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
when you dig into this report a little
 
04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
bit more they looked at all 50 states so
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is actually one of 16
 
04:44:18.788 --> 04:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
states that still requires vehicle
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
inspections if you look at the other
 
04:44:22.948 --> 04:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
states that don't require inspections
 
04:44:25.708 --> 04:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
there actually is no difference in the
 
04:44:28.030 --> 04:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
fatality and injury rate so again
 
04:44:31.390 --> 04:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections don't tend to have a
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
statistically significant effect on the
 
04:44:36.150 --> 04:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
safety of our roadways
 
04:44:38.708 --> 04:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
um another thing when you dig into this
 
04:44:41.310 --> 04:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
report a a little bit deeper is the
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
cause of vehicle uh vehicle accidents
 
04:44:46.868 --> 04:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
only 2% of them are actually caused by
 
04:44:49.868 --> 04:44:49.878 align:start position:0%
component failures so the report goes on
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
to say because this was like a report
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
about looking into studying vehicle
 
04:44:56.910 --> 04:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
inspection looked into studying them a
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
little bit more and the report literally
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
said like
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
listen component failures are such a
 
04:45:05.190 --> 04:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
minor Factor vehicle wrecks that's it's
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
not even worth researching it we might
 
04:45:09.390 --> 04:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
as well look into causes of uh vehicle
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
accidents that are more prevalent um
 
04:45:16.430 --> 04:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
so it is true that if you look at the
 
04:45:18.910 --> 04:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
data that some new vehicles do fail
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
inspection but if you dig into that data
 
04:45:23.070 --> 04:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that the causes for
 
04:45:25.230 --> 04:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
those failures is pretty minor so in
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
2022 880,000 new vehicles were inspected
 
04:45:32.948 --> 04:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
and of that only 142 failed so that's a
 
04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
I mean just a minuscule number and out
 
04:45:37.628 --> 04:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
of that 142 one of the biggest factors
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
was glass so that could be like a chip
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
in your windshield that could be window
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
tenting that could be all kinds of
 
04:45:44.230 --> 04:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
things the second biggest factor in this
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
was literally like vehicle information
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at Vin plates license
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
plates or possibly a valid registration
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
so it it's it's not looking like these
 
04:46:00.110 --> 04:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
aren't real safety issues uh the other
 
04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
com the other argument against this is
 
04:46:05.750 --> 04:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
high mileage vehicles
 
04:46:09.310 --> 04:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
so if you are driving your vehicle and
 
04:46:11.550 --> 04:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
some people put 30 40,000 Mi on their
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle you're driving it for a reason
 
04:46:15.390 --> 04:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
so you're going to take care of that
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle so I again maintaining your
 
04:46:20.830 --> 04:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
warranty all that stuff you're going to
 
04:46:22.990 --> 04:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
take care of your car so the uh
 
04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
inspections I feel are just kind of
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
redundant and lastly the what they're
 
04:46:31.708 --> 04:46:31.718 align:start position:0%
going to talk about is the EPA so our
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspections have emissions
 
04:46:36.510 --> 04:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
testing added into it
 
04:46:40.830 --> 04:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
and the emissions testing portion of the
 
04:46:42.430 --> 04:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
the of the inspection is something we're
 
04:46:43.948 --> 04:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
going to have to go back and and
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
reevaluate because the EFA or the EPA
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
actually requires us to do that and then
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
we have to talk about our missions and I
 
04:46:52.510 --> 04:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
guess they have to take it from other
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
parts so basically what's going to end
 
04:46:57.470 --> 04:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
up happening is when we go we pass this
 
04:46:59.948 --> 04:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
law we can go to the EPA and say listen
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is what we've done and you
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
know considering that this is on the
 
04:47:09.230 --> 04:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
cleanest I guess segment of our vehicles
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
brand new cars some of them EV some of
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
them hybrids it's really not going to
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
affect our emissions or our air quality
 
04:47:17.310 --> 04:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
that much and on top of that if you look
 
04:47:19.868 --> 04:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
at the states around us Rhode Island you
 
04:47:21.390 --> 04:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to get your new vehicle
 
04:47:22.830 --> 04:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
inspected or you don't have to get
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
admissions testing for two years
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut you don't have to get you
 
04:47:28.830 --> 04:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
you can go four years so I mean if Rhode
 
04:47:30.270 --> 04:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
Island and Connecticut can work out with
 
04:47:32.190 --> 04:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
the EPA that they can go that long
 
04:47:33.670 --> 04:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
without AEM Mission sessioning I think
 
04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
new hampsh I'm sure does so lastly if
 
04:47:40.470 --> 04:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
you look at it you know going to getting
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
a vehicle inspection doesn't seem like a
 
04:47:46.230 --> 04:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
big deal but if I say I take an hour out
 
04:47:47.390 --> 04:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
of your time to go get a vehicle
 
04:47:49.590 --> 04:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
inspection this bill is going to save
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
about 80,000 vehicle inspections a year
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
that equates to 10 years of our
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
constituents time so given that there's
 
04:47:59.150 --> 04:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
no real effect on safety there's no real
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
effect on emissions is it worth it for
 
04:48:04.030 --> 04:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
us to ask for 10 hours of our con
 
04:48:06.390 --> 04:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
consent time just to kind of have safety
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
theater so that's about all I got so
 
04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you and I
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
request a division
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:27.280 --> 04:48:30.628 align:start position:0%
 
syes

04:48:30.628 --> 04:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
see so colleagues you just heard a lot
 
04:48:38.910 --> 04:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
of interesting uh data from the uh the
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
kind gentleman from uh Meredith but like
 
04:48:44.948 --> 04:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
all data there's two sides to the coin
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to try and talk about some
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
of the other ways that this data can be
 
04:48:52.350 --> 04:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
interpreted and about some safety issues
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
so the first thing that you should
 
04:48:56.590 --> 04:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
remember is that the bill as it is
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
written possibly is not just about new
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
cars but rather about cars that could be
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
two and perh in some cases depending on
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
the date of birth for the person who
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
buys it and when the model year came out
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
could be actually 3 years old and that
 
04:49:14.708 --> 04:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
means a lot of mileage on the
 
04:49:14.718 --> 04:49:16.470 align:start position:0%
means a lot of mileage on the
road

04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:49:19.590 --> 04:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
now all of our neighboring states in New
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
England do have inspection programs and
 
04:49:25.390 --> 04:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
they vary in the way that they take care
 
04:49:28.470 --> 04:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
of those uh issues
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
but we have to be really careful about
 
04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
how if we look at other states and other
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
parts of the the country
 
04:49:39.628 --> 04:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
why those that don't have inspection
 
04:49:44.030 --> 04:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
programs don't have them they don't have
 
04:49:47.230 --> 04:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
the kind of road conditions weather
 
04:49:49.470 --> 04:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
conditions that are prevalent here in
 
04:49:52.270 --> 04:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if you think about it the
 
04:49:54.270 --> 04:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
weather changes here quite
 
04:49:57.628 --> 04:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
frequently the elevations for roads can
 
04:50:00.270 --> 04:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
change 89 for instance can be quite
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
lovely in just a gentle rain but to go a
 
04:50:05.390 --> 04:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
little further 89 suddenly you got a
 
04:50:08.788 --> 04:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
little snow blizzard on your hands um in
 
04:50:10.590 --> 04:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
addition to that here in New Hampshire
 
04:50:14.510 --> 04:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
they use brine liquid salt water to
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
treat the roads if you drive over to
 
04:50:20.510 --> 04:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont they don't do that so that brine
 
04:50:23.948 --> 04:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
has an effect on your vehicles and part
 
04:50:25.788 --> 04:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
of the inspection program takes a look
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
be I want to talk about how we look at
 
04:50:39.788 --> 04:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
this safety data
 
04:50:42.430 --> 04:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
information one of the reasons that um
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
again my colleague referred to the fact
 
04:50:47.788 --> 04:50:47.798 align:start position:0%
that there only a couple less than a
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
less than 200 failures of new cars over
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
80 uh I think he said 880,000 but let's
 
04:50:58.830 --> 04:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
review how this process usually works I
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't know about you but I owned years
 
04:51:06.150 --> 04:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
back a relatively new car and I brought
 
04:51:07.948 --> 04:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
it in and they found a problem with it
 
04:51:11.430 --> 04:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
and what did I do I said we just fix it
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
and they did and they fixed it under
 
04:51:17.230 --> 04:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
warranty and so while it would have
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
failed inspection under that
 
04:51:22.628 --> 04:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
circumstance it actually passed because
 
04:51:25.830 --> 04:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
I took care of the problem then and I
 
04:51:28.628 --> 04:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
saved some money while I was doing it so
 
04:51:30.470 --> 04:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
think about that your constituents
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
potentially can save money and the the
 
04:51:36.190 --> 04:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
the amount of new vehicles that actually
 
04:51:39.868 --> 04:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
fail on first blush is much higher than
 
04:51:43.510 --> 04:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.150 --> 04:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
suppose the department of
 
04:51:49.070 --> 04:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
safety is against this bill and one of
 
04:51:51.150 --> 04:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
the big reasons is that the bill
 
04:51:54.548 --> 04:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
provides no mechanism for an alternate
 
04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
for an alternative stickering scheme so
 
04:51:59.990 --> 04:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're the local police officer driving
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
down the road and you see a car with no
 
04:52:03.120 --> 04:52:05.430 align:start position:0%
down the road and you see a car with no
inspection

04:52:05.430 --> 04:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
04:52:10.150 --> 04:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
sticker and what do you do is the is the
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
car new enough to avoid having to have
 
04:52:14.670 --> 04:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
that sticker do we put a different kind
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
of sticker in subsequent legislation I
 
04:52:20.350 --> 04:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
think we have to be mindful that this is
 
04:52:22.270 --> 04:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
not quite ready because they haven't
 
04:52:24.590 --> 04:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
answered that question we certainly
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
don't want police officers pulling over
 
04:52:30.390 --> 04:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
all vehicles just because there's a
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
question about whether they have
 
04:52:33.868 --> 04:52:33.878 align:start position:0%
stickers or not and they can't answer
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
that question easily like they do
 
04:52:41.350 --> 04:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
now I want to talk about the EPA
 
04:52:45.310 --> 04:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
issue it is true that some other states
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
have been able
 
04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
to um modify their agreements for about
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh greenhouse gases with the EPA but we
 
04:52:57.230 --> 04:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
need to be mindful of this fact here in
 
04:53:00.350 --> 04:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire more than nearly half I'm
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
sorry nearly half of the greenhouse
 
04:53:06.910 --> 04:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
gases come from motor vehicles and we do
 
04:53:06.920 --> 04:53:09.070 align:start position:0%
gases come from motor vehicles and we do
not

04:53:09.070 --> 04:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:53:12.270 --> 04:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
have alternative sources that the EPA
 
04:53:14.830 --> 04:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
could say well we can we can you can
 
04:53:18.270 --> 04:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
forgo some of the yearly in uh EPA you
 
04:53:18.280 --> 04:53:19.470 align:start position:0%
forgo some of the yearly in uh EPA you
know

04:53:19.470 --> 04:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:53:22.990 --> 04:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
testing and we'll have other industries
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
make up for it we just don't have those
 
04:53:27.868 --> 04:53:27.878 align:start position:0%
types of Industries those heavy carbon
 
04:53:30.230 --> 04:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
polluters they just they're not here in
 
04:53:32.910 --> 04:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
the state so that's a real issue and
 
04:53:35.628 --> 04:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
this build does not speak to
 
04:53:39.788 --> 04:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
how we'll fix that problem if in fact it
 
04:53:41.548 --> 04:53:41.558 align:start position:0%
comes to
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
pass you know and I've already alluded
 
04:53:47.670 --> 04:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
to this but 24 to 36 months is too long
 
04:53:50.470 --> 04:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
for uh an annual
 
04:53:52.390 --> 04:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
inspection I don't know how many miles
 
04:53:55.628 --> 04:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
you put on your car but um many people
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
will go well beyond the reasonable
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
expectation for tires they will go well
 
04:54:03.750 --> 04:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
beyond the reasonable expectation
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
possibly for breaks um these things
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
often times people learn of the problem
 
04:54:13.230 --> 04:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
because they get their vehicles
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
inspected not everybody is an under the
 
04:54:20.430 --> 04:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
hood kind of guy or girl who can fix
 
04:54:26.270 --> 04:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
these things they need that for them
 
04:54:31.150 --> 04:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
finally a big impetus for this bill
 
04:54:33.948 --> 04:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
was this sort of feeling that there were
 
04:54:36.510 --> 04:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh our constituents who were
 
04:54:40.350 --> 04:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
complaining about the garages were not
 
04:54:41.948 --> 04:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
treating them
 
04:54:45.510 --> 04:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
fairly and yet the numbers of formal
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
complaints is minuscule compared to the
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
numbers of literally the millions of
 
04:54:53.708 --> 04:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
cars that get inspected and recently the
 
04:54:58.350 --> 04:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
DMV has made changes about posting on
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
your report your inspection report and
 
04:55:02.948 --> 04:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
there's further work about getting a
 
04:55:05.910 --> 04:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
poster in the inspection station that
 
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
tells you you can call the New Hampshire
 
04:55:10.470 --> 04:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety talk to the New
 
04:55:12.070 --> 04:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state police and they will
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
come down if you feel grieved about your
 
04:55:18.030 --> 04:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
garage's work you can come down and have
 
04:55:22.390 --> 04:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
them look at your inspection and say yes
 
04:55:25.350 --> 04:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
this is correct or no it's not and um
 
04:55:27.070 --> 04:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
but that does not happen often but it
 
04:55:27.080 --> 04:55:28.310 align:start position:0%
but that does not happen often but it
could

04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:55:28.320 --> 04:55:30.910 align:start position:0%
could
happen

04:55:30.910 --> 04:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:55:34.150 --> 04:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
so um if not already requested Mr
 
04:55:41.270 --> 04:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr Speaker good
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
afternoon Co colleagues just like the
 
04:55:56.110 --> 04:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
pastor in the church when he says
 
04:55:57.830 --> 04:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
tonight's sermon will be short my
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
comments will be
 
04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
brief I stand in support of HB 1391 I
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
believe 1391 is a logical and practical
 
04:56:10.548 --> 04:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
change to the inspection program now in
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
testimony opponents to this bill brought
 
04:56:15.310 --> 04:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
up issues about cars that are driven
 
04:56:19.030 --> 04:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
hard driving 35,000 mil 40,000 miles and
 
04:56:20.830 --> 04:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
the big issue was okay we're not going
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
to inspect these at 70 or 880,000
 
04:56:27.628 --> 04:56:27.638 align:start position:0%
miles well I've had the chance in many
 
04:56:30.910 --> 04:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
in in my past to buy a new car and when
 
04:56:32.910 --> 04:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
I've leased or purchased a new car I
 
04:56:35.868 --> 04:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
bring it to the same dealership and when
 
04:56:38.270 --> 04:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
I bring it to the same dealership they
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
they honor my warranty but in addition
 
04:56:44.030 --> 04:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
to that I get a checklist in some cases
 
04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
15 to 20 points in which they check my
 
04:56:49.470 --> 04:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
tires they check my fluids to check my
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
brakes etc etc so the mechanics go
 
04:56:56.350 --> 04:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
through an extensive or at least a a a
 
04:56:57.948 --> 04:56:57.958 align:start position:0%
piece of it to go through your car to
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
find out potential issues so I find that
 
04:57:03.788 --> 04:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
that that argument is kind of M
 
04:57:05.750 --> 04:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
so in closing I believe that this bill
 
04:57:08.548 --> 04:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
is logical and a practical change to the
 
04:57:11.030 --> 04:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
inspection program I ask you to press
 
04:57:13.868 --> 04:57:13.878 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I I know that contrary to the

04:59:12.750 --> 04:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
bill but that matters of Public Safety
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
in this complex world that we live in is
 
04:59:18.430 --> 04:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
never a simple
 
04:59:21.230 --> 04:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
matter and if we protect the lives of a
 
04:59:24.628 --> 04:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
few people by this program isn't that
 
04:59:27.390 --> 04:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
really part of what we're trying to
 
04:59:29.670 --> 04:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
accomplish and if I know that this bill
 
04:59:31.910 --> 04:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
will allow vehicles with high mileage to
 
04:59:34.350 --> 04:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
go uninspected
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:59:38.350 --> 04:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
the number of new cars that fail
 
04:59:41.030 --> 04:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
inspection I want to repeat this again
 
04:59:44.030 --> 04:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
is seriously under reported most of them
 
04:59:47.110 --> 04:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
get fixed right away what I now vote red
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
so that another motion can be
 
04:59:52.110 --> 04:59:52.120 align:start position:0%
made chair recognize representative Au
 
04:59:56.750 --> 04:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:00:02.030 --> 05:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that only 15 states still
 
05:00:04.110 --> 05:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
require annual
 
05:00:07.150 --> 05:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
banal inspections and in New England the
 
05:00:08.590 --> 05:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
state of Connecticut does not require
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
safety inspections on personal vehicles
 
05:00:13.190 --> 05:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
and only requires emissions inspections
 
05:00:15.708 --> 05:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
after four years and the state of Rhode
 
05:00:17.270 --> 05:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
Island requires them only after the
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
second year which is very similar to
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
this bill and if I know that states that
 
05:00:23.350 --> 05:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
have discontinued inspection programs
 
05:00:24.788 --> 05:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
including States like Colorado and
 
05:00:26.230 --> 05:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
Wyoming with some of the harshest
 
05:00:28.670 --> 05:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
weather in the country have seen no
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
discernable increase in accidents and if
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
I know that this this bill exempts only
 
05:00:36.548 --> 05:00:36.558 align:start position:0%
a small number of vehicles that are
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
brand new and that annual inspections
 
05:00:40.910 --> 05:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
will otherwise still be required just as
 
05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
they are now would I now press the green
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%

federal government has no guard rails on
 
05:06:14.830 --> 05:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
its ever increasing debt and if I know
 
05:06:17.190 --> 05:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
that no one alive today has consented to
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
be governed by this federal government

05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
federal government is completely Rogue
 
05:06:29.230 --> 05:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
and only acts outside a law and further
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
if I know that this Federal Government
 
05:06:34.270 --> 05:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
taxes its own citizens at 40% just so it
 
05:06:36.750 --> 05:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
can bomb citizens of other nations as a
 
05:06:37.788 --> 05:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
05:06:40.150 --> 05:06:40.160 align:start position:0%

included integrated circuits laths

Machinery light bulbs and many other
 
05:09:49.510 --> 05:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
products Taiwan would like for their

relationship to continue as it is
 
05:09:53.350 --> 05:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
mutually beneficial relationship for
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
both New Hampshire and Taiwan the recent
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
elections in Taiwan are a good
 
05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
indication by the Taiwanese
 
05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
people that their desire is for the
 
05:10:04.030 --> 05:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
current party the Democratic People's
 
05:10:06.310 --> 05:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
Party to remain in charge as life is
 
05:10:08.430 --> 05:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
good for Taiwan at this time and they
 
05:10:09.708 --> 05:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
wish for the trend of peace and
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
prosperity to continue the only threat
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
to Taiwan lies across the straight of
 
05:10:16.990 --> 05:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
fosa Taiwan is a friend in need of our
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
support at this time and by passing this
 
05:10:21.390 --> 05:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
resolution you can join me in saying
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
just that Taiwan we support you the
 
05:10:26.190 --> 05:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
methods by which we support Taiwan this
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
time are suggested in the resolution a
 
05:10:30.750 --> 05:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
simple driver's license reciprocity
 
05:10:32.590 --> 05:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
agreement with New Hampshire you drive
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side of the road over
 
05:10:36.430 --> 05:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
there by the way a memorandum of

Taiwan an interesting historical fact is
 
05:11:18.030 --> 05:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
my leags also known as Madame Chang
 
05:11:19.708 --> 05:11:19.718 align:start position:0%
China's Eternal first lady and her
 
05:11:22.190 --> 05:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
sister Ching Lings the mother of China
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
learned to swim in Meredith Bay and
 
05:11:26.190 --> 05:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
attended summer school on Meredith neck
 
05:11:28.590 --> 05:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
from 1908 to
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
1913 Madame Chang later had a summer
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
house in wolfboro and spent many Summers
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
there until her passing in 2003 at the
 
05:11:36.590 --> 05:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
age of
 
05:11:39.030 --> 05:11:39.040 align:start position:0%

05:11:40.708 --> 05:11:40.718 align:start position:0%

05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
president chanai Sheek lived in a
 
05:11:46.708 --> 05:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
Lakehouse on Sun Moon Lake up on the
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
mountains in Taiwan I suspect that our
 
05:11:51.628 --> 05:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
Lake wiip reminded her of Home
 
05:11:53.510 --> 05:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
although I bet she preferred to SL swim
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
in our Lake winaki as our lake has much
 
05:11:58.830 --> 05:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
clearer water it's imperative that we
 
05:12:01.190 --> 05:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
support Taiwan at this juncture their
 
05:12:03.390 --> 05:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
young democracy is vibrant and strong
 
05:12:04.830 --> 05:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
they are the eighth largest trade
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
partner with the United States and let's
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
not forget that Taiwan produces 70% plus
 
05:12:11.548 --> 05:12:11.558 align:start position:0%
of the world's large-scale integrated
 
05:12:13.868 --> 05:12:13.878 align:start position:0%
circuits absent these chips we would not
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
be making any phone calls sending emails
 
05:12:18.750 --> 05:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
or driving any of our cars and trucks
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
much of the 21st century Life as we know
 
05:12:23.510 --> 05:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
it would come to a halt you get that
 
05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
idea we' get back to the anong era New
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs the strong ties to
 
05:12:30.430 --> 05:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
Taiwan to continue as they are as they
 
05:12:32.590 --> 05:12:32.600 align:start position:0%

05:12:34.948 --> 05:12:34.958 align:start position:0%

05:18:07.948 --> 05:18:07.958 align:start position:0%
standard
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
vehicle so you'll see in the claim in
 
05:18:11.548 --> 05:18:11.558 align:start position:0%
the house calendar
 
05:18:13.868 --> 05:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
report that the proposed legislation
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
already exists under Federal CH uh
 
05:18:19.230 --> 05:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation under the Clean Air
 
05:18:23.310 --> 05:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
Act it does not neither the EPA or the
 
05:18:25.150 --> 05:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
justice department are in the regular
 
05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
habit of patrolling our New Hampshire
 
05:18:30.190 --> 05:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
highways any more than placing agents to
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
monor the garages that perform per these
 
05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
inspections so Highway enforcement will
 
05:18:37.830 --> 05:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
not happen at the federal level which is
 
05:18:39.430 --> 05:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
why several states have already passed
 
05:18:42.030 --> 05:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
legislation similar to this rolling coal
 
05:18:44.548 --> 05:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
bill in order to curb this nefarious
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
action to State regulation has um no
 
05:18:49.948 --> 05:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
means of enforcement on the state level
 
05:18:52.230 --> 05:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
as it does in your calendar to make that
 
05:18:54.390 --> 05:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
statement um as the reason for opposing
 
05:18:57.070 --> 05:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is extremely disingenuous the
 
05:18:59.590 --> 05:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
entire point of this legislation is to
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
make enforcement possible
 
05:19:04.390 --> 05:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation places the right tool
 
05:19:06.430 --> 05:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
in the hands of law
 
05:19:09.470 --> 05:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement I also want to be clear this
 
05:19:11.470 --> 05:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
legislation does not Target the driver
 
05:19:13.750 --> 05:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
of an older vehicle that inadvertently
 
05:19:16.150 --> 05:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
belches fumes as a former tractor
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
trailer driver myself I'm fully aware
 
05:19:21.270 --> 05:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
that these slight transgressions are
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes the cost of
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
operation this is about the local guy
 
05:19:26.990 --> 05:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
that costs up
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
$1,500 to Il legally install one of
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
these devices which are easily easily
 
05:19:35.270 --> 05:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
identifiable even without belching black
 
05:19:37.990 --> 05:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
smoke these rather oversized devices are
 
05:19:39.670 --> 05:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
attached under the hood and an obvious
 
05:19:41.868 --> 05:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
place the switching devices inside the
 
05:19:44.990 --> 05:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
cab are also another giveaway not to
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
mention the oversized exhaust pipes and
 
05:19:49.230 --> 05:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
if you still can't recognize it another
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
identifier is the decals that these
 
05:19:53.470 --> 05:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
trucks often support decals reading
 
05:19:57.948 --> 05:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
rolling coal black smoke matters Prius
 
05:20:02.070 --> 05:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
repellent sorry or the obvious I roll
 
05:20:04.470 --> 05:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
whole it's said that we have no idea of
 
05:20:07.230 --> 05:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
how often this occurred that was one of
 
05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
the other comments isn't once enough how
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
many bank robberies do we let occur
 
05:20:16.510 --> 05:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
before we take action we have six bicy
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
we run over in Texas last year by a
 
05:20:21.470 --> 05:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
teenager that was trying to roll coal
 
05:20:22.830 --> 05:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
and then ended up rolling over the
 
05:20:25.868 --> 05:20:25.878 align:start position:0%
bikers instead would be quicker to move
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation if one of our children
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
were victim to
 
05:20:30.120 --> 05:20:32.110 align:start position:0%
were victim to
that

05:20:32.110 --> 05:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:33.708 --> 05:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
they're also debating the meaning of
 
05:20:35.868 --> 05:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
significant quantities in the original
 
05:20:38.350 --> 05:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
bill now any modification defeat a
 
05:20:40.990 --> 05:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle's admissions control is illegal
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
under federal law which is why my floor
 
05:20:44.830 --> 05:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment strikes these words from the
 
05:20:46.510 --> 05:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill there's a floor Amendment it no
 
05:20:49.868 --> 05:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
longer says significant quantities it
 
05:20:51.430 --> 05:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
could be rather nitpicky for to have
 
05:20:54.110 --> 05:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
this but let's be clear the intent of
 
05:20:56.948 --> 05:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
rolling coal is to break the law if the
 
05:20:58.510 --> 05:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
law breaker doesn't succeed in the
 
05:21:03.150 --> 05:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
as I said these modifications are easily
 
05:21:07.470 --> 05:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
identifiable and police know how to
 
05:21:10.708 --> 05:21:10.718 align:start position:0%
enforce laws let me repeat that police
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.470 --> 05:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
laws with the official while the
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
official position of the State Police is
 
05:21:21.470 --> 05:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
neutral in my conversations with the
 
05:21:23.190 --> 05:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
state police they have said this would
 
05:21:26.150 --> 05:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
be a valuable tool in their attempt to
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
calm New Hampshire
 
05:21:30.270 --> 05:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
roads now perhaps there are flaws in the
 
05:21:32.430 --> 05:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
drafting of this leg isolation but at
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
the minimum this bill should be sent to
 
05:21:36.310 --> 05:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
the body on the other side of the wall
 
05:21:39.150 --> 05:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
for a deeper dive the only reason I can
 
05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
think of opposing this is because we
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
support felons that create unsafe
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
driving conditions over providing
 
05:21:47.310 --> 05:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
support for law enforcement suffs to
 
05:21:49.948 --> 05:21:49.958 align:start position:0%
maintain safe and calm New Hampshire
 
05:21:51.788 --> 05:21:51.798 align:start position:0%
highways so if you're opposed to
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
felonious and unsafe driving practices
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
then help me remove this itl so that
 
05:21:58.510 --> 05:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
another motion can be brought forward
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
and let's let law enforcement do his job
 
05:22:03.948 --> 05:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker I ask for division
 
05:22:06.990 --> 05:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
V thank you chair recognize the
 
05:22:07.000 --> 05:22:21.070 align:start position:0%
V thank you chair recognize the
representative

05:22:21.070 --> 05:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:23.590 --> 05:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
Walt uh thank you Mr Speaker uh the
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee on Transportation voted this
 
05:22:29.390 --> 05:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
bill down or inexpedient to legislate 17
 
05:22:33.150 --> 05:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
to Zer for two main reasons one it's
 
05:22:35.990 --> 05:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
already illegal RSA
 
05:22:38.548 --> 05:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
26659 very briefly the engine and power
 
05:22:40.868 --> 05:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
mechanism every motor vehicle shall be
 
05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
so equipped and adjusted as to prevent
 
05:22:46.110 --> 05:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
The Escape of excessive fumes smoke
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
flame gas oil or fuel
 
05:22:52.110 --> 05:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
residue now this bill is about excessive
 
05:22:54.150 --> 05:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
smoke but it also comes with an
 
05:22:58.030 --> 05:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
excessive punishment for an individual
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
any this is from the bill any person who
 
05:23:02.350 --> 05:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
violates this section shall be subject
 
05:23:05.470 --> 05:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
to a penalty of not more than
 
05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
$5,000 does the punishment fit the crime
 
05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
the committee on Transportation says no
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
please join us and support the committee
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%

05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is inexp to
 
05:24:21.548 --> 05:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
legislate and House Bill
 
05:24:24.910 --> 05:24:24.920 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that what
 
05:24:38.510 --> 05:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
we just heard was a compelling argument
 
05:24:40.750 --> 05:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
but what we really need is a serious
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
debate and if I know that existing
 
05:24:46.830 --> 05:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
federal laws on this issue are not being
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
enforced on New Hampshire roads and if I
 
05:24:51.628 --> 05:24:51.638 align:start position:0%
know that hb1
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
1447 would allow law enforcement to
 
05:24:57.350 --> 05:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
police this already illegal Behavior
 
05:24:59.430 --> 05:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
overturn the it
 
05:25:03.070 --> 05:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
and allow another motion to be made
