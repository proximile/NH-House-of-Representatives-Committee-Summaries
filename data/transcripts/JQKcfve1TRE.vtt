Pageant MC to describe her perfect date

she said
 
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
April 25th because it's not too hot or
 
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
not too cold
 
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
so we are here on the perfect date
 
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 align:start position:0%

and one of those persons is Senator Dan
 
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 align:start position:0%
the other people
 
00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
there's that was a compromise yes all
 
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
right well thank you for that uh Dan
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
Ennis uh from Bradford New Hampshire
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
representing District Seven and I'm
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
pleased to be here this morning
 
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
um with the August committee members and
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
the esteemed chair uh to introduce to
 
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
you Senate Bill uh 253 and this is a
 
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.930 align:start position:0%
you Senate Bill uh 253 and this is a
relatively

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
um simple and straightforward bill and
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at the text of the bill
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it's really less than a
 
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
page and essentially what this bill does
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
is simply create a situation where if a
 
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.810 align:start position:0%
is simply create a situation where if a
parent

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
requests the records of treatment for a
 
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
minor medical treatment that those need
 
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
to be released to the parent so you know
 
00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 align:start position:0%
as I say it's extremely straightforward
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
it does have some Protections in there
 
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
in the event a physician or other health
 
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
caregiver has reason to believe that
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
such disclosures would put the child at
 
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
risk then that information can in fact
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
be withheld I'm happy to take any
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
questions you might have and I know
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
there are others who will be testifying
 
00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 align:start position:0%
so much senator for coming and sharing
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
your bill with us my question is on line
 
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
16 of your bill which is section c it
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
says when a healthcare provider has
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
determined by clear and convincing
 
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
evidence based upon articulable fact
 
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
that disclosure of Records to a parent
 
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
is likely to result in abuse or neglect
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
then they can take action my question is
 
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
how does this match with RSA 169 C 13
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
which says that the burden for dcyf so
 
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases is a
 
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence how do we
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
reconcile that this bill amongst other
 
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
bills we've seen this session
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
is asking people who are mandated
 
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
reporters to utilize a higher burden of
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
proof than what dcif would look at when
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
determining whether abuse or neglect is
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
likely to occur or have occurred
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I can answer that in a
 
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
way that would satisfy me
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
um so if I might
 
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.010 align:start position:0%
um so if I might
um

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 align:start position:0%
do you feel that a change in language in
 
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
this bill would be appropriate perhaps
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
through an amendment to bring it in line
 
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
with that RSA personally I personally
 
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
having worked in child welfare for my
 
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
entire career cannot support any bill
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
that uses clear and convincing when
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
referring to abuse and neglect okay so
 
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
that's my personal stance and I've been
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
very vocal in the well and hear about
 
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.629 align:start position:0%
very vocal in the well and hear about
that

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 align:start position:0%
um but I can't speak for the rest of so
 
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
would it be true that you're more
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
comfortable with articulable facts I'm
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with making sure that
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
any bill that we have doesn't undermine
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
our child protective statute because I
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
think that we have an obligation to the
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
children of our state I agree thank you
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
 
00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:13.249 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton thank you Mr
chairman

00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering how this would
 
00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
translate into mental health where
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of the most protected
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
portion of mental or sorry medical
 
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.969 align:start position:0%
portion of mental or sorry medical
records

00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
um so I just don't know how this would
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
align well they're so carve out in the
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
bill for mental health so I think the
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
the the intent is that mental health
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
will be the same as physical health and
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
again information will be released to
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
the parent unless there is a reason to
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
believe the child would be at risk if
 
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
that information is released
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
so I mean mental health is a is a
 
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to understand why we even
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
need this bill it's my understanding we
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
have a constitutional right for parents
 
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
to access uh Records period yes thank
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
you for that and I I anticipated
 
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
um that question and I I think when you
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
look at it you say well okay then why
 
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.370 align:start position:0%
look at it you say well okay then why
not

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a statement that
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
reinforces what we all believe many of
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
us believe should be the case and that
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
is parents should have
 
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
open access to their child Children's
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
Medical Records so
 
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think it's a
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
reaffirmation and right now where we're
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
seeing information withheld in some
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
cases I think it makes sense to put this
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
into place
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm sorry I didn't
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
understand that oh it's like we do you
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
agree we do have a constitutional right
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
for access to records or
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera I believe that we do
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's being fully followed
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
in all cases
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
and this this I believe helps bring it
 
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
back to the fore and reinforces that
 
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.430 align:start position:0%
back to the fore and reinforces that
right

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr chairman follow-up
 
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
on line 12 you've you've jumped in with
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
a protective order yes and it looks like
 
00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
it's kind of automatic and it seems like
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
excessive and extreme to me which would
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
not be I don't believe that that would
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
apply in a constitutional right
 
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.730 align:start position:0%
apply in a constitutional right
so

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
um it's like a conflict here by putting
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
these exceptions in
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
I see and that was the biggest one and I
 
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
do agree with
 
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond on the issue of
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
the uh healthcare provider it's a broad
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
very broad term it is and articulate
 
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
it's a very low uh threshold and then of
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
course you get clearance Adventure which
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
is much higher right so uh
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
anyway I I guess if you don't want to
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
answer that I understand I'm not sure I
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
know how to answer that okay but thank
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate the question thank you
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
Senate yes
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
um something from me I do know in this
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
committee people from both parties
 
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.590 align:start position:0%
committee people from both parties
um

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
will speak in favor if it's their thing
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
and against if it isn't on why do we put
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
something in law that's already in law
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
and I've heard some very cogent
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
arguments from both sides why it doesn't
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
hurt if it's already in law uh under one
 
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
of the carve outs we know that there are
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
certain federal exceptions
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
um you may not know I'm part-time CEO of
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
a medical and Counseling Center in
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
Kingston so I take these things up with
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
my staff and learn a lot and sometimes
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
that translates to what I'm doing here
 
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
yes and they have told me repeatedly of
 
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
the carve outs that are federal if a
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
person of tender age is a patient or a
 
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
client certain things are not shareable
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's federal law and to me the
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
parenthetical a uh simply just
 
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
underscores we believe that we will
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
follow that
 
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
I've also heard from my staff that they
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
like the the idea of articular bull
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
facts even if it's unpronounceable it's
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
a good idea because otherwise you can
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
get extremely subjective that's right
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
and while many people in the medical and
 
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
counseling profession are
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
you know as objective as they possibly
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
um would you believe with me that there
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
were some who aren't I would believe
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
that be required to okay prove your case
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
you don't want this information passed
 
00:12:45.889 --> 00:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
on is it because you have an agenda or
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
is it because you think there's good
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
reason if there's good reason you should
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
be able to articulate it absolutely yes
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you is that your purpose of that
 
00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
that is the purpose representative thank
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
you for clarifying welcome
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
and forgive me my allergies are awful
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
today so my that isn't quite where it
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
normally might be but thank you any
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
questions representative Moulton yes
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman uh another
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
source of concern that I have over this
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
is that they're
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
and this is a little bit
 
00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:17.090 align:start position:0%
and this is a little bit
um

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
different than I than I The Stance I
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
normally take
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
um because I I have issues usually if
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's too much of a of a punishment
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
um but in this case I'm on the opposite
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
end of the spectrum where there's
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
there's no punishment and
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our law system
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
has a hard time preventing laws from
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
being broken and they're only punishing
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
laws after they're broken and by having
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
some type of punishment it can tend to
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
defer crime but we have a hard time
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
preventing crime yes so in this case if
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
there's so what coming together uh in
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
this case if there's no punishment
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
involved then there's no way to defer
 
00:14:04.079 --> 00:14:06.350 align:start position:0%
involved then there's no way to defer
this

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
um from being broken in other words on
 
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
line 18
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
there there has to be that they would
 
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.949 align:start position:0%
there there has to be that they would
um

00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the health care would have to determine
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
that there would be abuse and neglect
 
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:23.060 align:start position:0%
correct but there's no way to really
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
know that so then if they're going and
 
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
disclosing all of this mental health all
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
these mental health issues
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
aren't they without knowing you got to
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
get into a question I am okay if there's
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
how how would we
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
if there's no way to know if there's
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
going to be abuse or neglect and no
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
punishment if they disclose something
 
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
then they're more likely to disclose
 
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.750 align:start position:0%
then they're more likely to disclose
something

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
without you know without knowing what's
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
going to happen and that can put the
 
00:14:59.889 --> 00:14:59.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
but there's also no penalty for
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
withholding that information if there is
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
articulable evidence that it might put
 
00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.019 align:start position:0%
the child at risk so I think you can go
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
on both sides of that particular
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
question the intent of this bill wasn't
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
to put people in jail but rather to
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
emphasize that this is important to
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
parents and families and to provide a
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
little bit of guidance there
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Senator to
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
follow up would it be the case that
 
00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:29.269 align:start position:0%
follow up would it be the case that
perhaps

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
were this to be signed into law and we
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
start to notice uh breaches of this in
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
any direction the follow-up then can be
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
some enforcement mechanism it could be
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime isn't it the case
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
that this is simply stating our intent
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
this is what we want that's correct okay
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
and that is the intent of the bill
 
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.550 align:start position:0%
and that is the intent of the bill
yes

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay any other questions
 
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
okay saying none thank you so much
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you and thank you all for
 
00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.339 align:start position:0%
your time and consideration have fun
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes that Jennifer Jones
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
welcome Jen to our place
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
in it you're only in trouble if you
 
00:16:34.129 --> 00:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
don't turn the mic on
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
you're good good morning good morning
 
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
um Jen Jones or Jennifer if I'm in
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
trouble like I said
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
um nice to see you all this morning
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me Office of the
 
00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:47.459 align:start position:0%
child advocate
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so we are here this morning in
 
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
opposition of SB 253
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
um and so while the office of the child
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
advocate absolutely recognizes the
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
importance for parental rights and
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
access to their child's health care
 
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.110 align:start position:0%
access to their child's health care
records

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:06.949 align:start position:0%
records
um

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
you know in an effort to be in the know
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
and to be able to safely parent their
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
child we also recognize flaws in this
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
bill that would put a child at risk one
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
of those flaws being
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
when you talk about a medical
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
professional or a health care provider
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
being able to recognize if abuse and or
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
neglect would be a risk factor in in
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
this bill it asks those providers to
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
make that judgment based on
 
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
um a preponderance of evidence and
 
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
that's a greater standard than we even
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
ask our investigators
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
um you know for example for a cpsw with
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
a division for children youth and
 
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.930 align:start position:0%
a division for children youth and
families

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
um they aren't even held to that
 
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.950 align:start position:0%
um they aren't even held to that
standard

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
able to access a totality of facts right
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
they they're tasked with an
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
investigation they're working with
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
Health Care law enforcement um Partners
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
in investigating
 
00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:05.390 align:start position:0%
in investigating
um

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
all aspects of the allegation and we're
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
asking that burden really to be put on
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
our Mental Health Providers our health
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
care providers when they don't have the
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
ability to to conduct such an
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
investigation to have those answers in
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
the Forefront and so I think in some of
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
that conversation has come up already
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
um you know in this room where it puts
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
our our children at risk and there are
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
protocols in place to ensure that Mental
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
Health Providers medical providers are
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
reporting concerns for abuse and or
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
neglect or
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
or um giving parents information that
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
they need to know or understand in an
 
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:48.539 align:start position:0%
effort to keep their kids safe and so
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
um you know I think this new uh ask is a
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
really really difficult one and it has
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
the you know the
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
possibility of really putting our
 
00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
children at risk and
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
um I also want to touch on the fact that
 
00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:02.630 align:start position:0%
um I also want to touch on the fact that
um

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
asking this Loops in mental health and
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
um parents being able to access their
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
children's mental health records that's
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
a really sacred relationship and I think
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
it runs the risk of
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
being able to be misused or
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
misrepresented and I think that's why
 
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.950 align:start position:0%
misrepresented and I think that's why
these

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
records are typically very difficult for
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
anyone to get a hold of
 
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
um you may see that play out where a
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
child May absolutely have disclosed
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
something may have happened to them
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
right but there's also co-occurring
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
mental health and that that may be used
 
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
to erode the child's credibility when in
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
fact both could be true
 
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
um and so I think
 
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:47.930 align:start position:0%
um and so I think
um

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
you know we we're very concerned that
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
mental health records are being looped
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
into this as well
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and I'm happy to
 
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none you came as genuinely as Jen
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much well thank you glad
 
00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
Dr Julie Kim I know you've got to get
 
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
back up north so
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
um I have a request that you get taken
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
uh soon on and here you are
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
thanks good morning I'm Dr Julie Kim I'm
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
here to testify as a pediatric
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
oncologist who's been practicing at
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health now for almost 18 years
 
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
in addition I'm the incoming president
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire chapter of the
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics so I
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
represent the pediatricians across this
 
00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
represent the pediatricians across this
state

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
as pediatricians our commitment is first
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
and foremost to our patient providing a
 
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
safe space for communication is
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
essential to upholding the commitment
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
which is why I speak on behalf of many
 
00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:54.539 align:start position:0%
who oppose Senate bill 253.
 
00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
as a pediatric oncologist my patients
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
have life-threatening diagnoses when I
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
meet a new adolescent patient I assure
 
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
them that our conversations happen in a
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
safe space open communication with my
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
patient is imperative for me to manage
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
their chemotherapy and their side
 
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.100 align:start position:0%
effects my patients will become
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised from their
 
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy and their increased risk
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
for infections
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
I need to know if my teen patients are
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
sexually active so I can appropriately
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
screen them and treat their infections
 
00:21:26.169 --> 00:21:26.179 align:start position:0%
before an infection becomes
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
life-threatening I need to know whether
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
my patient who is receiving chemotherapy
 
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
or radiation needs reproductive
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
counseling I also need to know if my
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
patient smokes Vapes drinks alcohol or
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
has a substance use disorder so we can
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
treat these as they may interact with
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
their treatments for that saves their
 
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.029 align:start position:0%
their treatments for that saves their
lives

00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
some teens as you know don't want their
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
parents or Guardians to know these kinds
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
of details about them they're going to
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
kill me it's a common comment and while
 
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419 align:start position:0%
I guarantee a safe space for discussions
 
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
with them that does not mean I block all
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
information to parents or Giver or
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
caregivers I and every pediatrician wish
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
every child had a nurturing caregiver
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
relationship and open communication with
 
00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.419 align:start position:0%
those who love them we spend much of our
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
time promoting and celebrating healthy
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
parental involvement and communication
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
and we work with our developing
 
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
adolescents to teach them how to manage
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
their emotions and communicate more
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
effectively with their caregivers we
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
offer to be present and facilitate and
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
mediate discussions with them
 
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the time this is
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
successful and my teen patients are able
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
to speak with their caregivers they can
 
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
process the news together support each
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
other and they all realize they have the
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
same goal as their child that my patient
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
everyone wants this patient to live the
 
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
healthiest life possible
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
however we still need to be mindful that
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
there are will there are exceptions and
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
there will always be exceptions I care
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
for a sexually active teenager with a
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
bone cancer and the first day that I met
 
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
her I diagnosed her with a sexually
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
transmitted infection she and her
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
parents already had a volatile
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
relationship her parents had a history
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence toward each other
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
and the parents had already sent my
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
patient away to live with other
 
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
relatives for short stints of time when
 
00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
her behavior became difficult
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
she did not want her parents to know she
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
was sexually active or about the
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
infection she did not think that she or
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
her parents could handle the additional
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
emotional turmoil on top of this new
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of cancer
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
so we discreetly treated her sexually
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
transmitted infection and we also
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
started appropriate contraception for
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
her so as it would have been
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
life-threatening for her if she were to
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
become pregnant while receiving
 
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy and radiation
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
we maintained a safe space with our
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
patient and this patient provider
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
relationship provided her a place to
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
talk to adults in a way that she had
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
never had a chance to before
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
she ended up being the first in her

family to go to college she's actually
thriving

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
thriving
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
as much as every pediatrician wants to
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
encourage healthy involvement by parents
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
and caregivers safe dialogue is not
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
always possible
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
however our commitment to our patient
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
must remain Central to our roles we must
 
00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:06.500 align:start position:0%
protect this please oppose Senate Bill
 
00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
253. thank you and I'm happy to answer
 
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
any questions I have a question when you
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
start breaking out specifics
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
you used numbers of topics like sexually
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
active sexually transmitted disease
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
that's not in play here
 
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for that in this bill
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
that is a carve out already federally
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
when my medical staff read this they I
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
asked them specify the things that were
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
this bill to pass you still cannot do
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
and they mentioned what you mentioned so
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not hearing a convincing argument
 
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:45.299 align:start position:0%
from you would you care to try to make
 
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:48.860 align:start position:0%
the argument using
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
problems of body and soul that are not
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
already forbidden here so I'm not an
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
expert on the semantics of legalese
 
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
certainly but I will say that as
 
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
pediatricians we want to protect all
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
spaces of that communication that we
 
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
have with our our patients our patients
 
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
are truly Central to our jobs and that
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
involves everything about that patient
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
so you're saying nothing
 
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
should be communicated to this child's
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
parents is is that what you're saying no
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
I think you misunderstand so all
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
pediatricians would love it if all the
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
patients could communicate openly with
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
their parents and their caregivers we
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
actually celebrate that and we would
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
hope that our families could develop
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
that kind of communication sometimes
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
that's not safe for the patient though
 
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:37.940 align:start position:0%
and when that's the case then we have to
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that our patient is our
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
priority I agree and that sounds like
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
what's described as isn't it an
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
articulable fact
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
if that is the case that is you
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
articulated it and it can be noted and
 
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.649 align:start position:0%
articulated it and it can be noted and
therefore

00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
I still haven't heard
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
anything that convinces me
 
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.029 align:start position:0%
anything that convinces me
okay

00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.850 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion by clear and
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence the fact that the
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
teen parents abused each other
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
in your opinion would that be clear in
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence to protect again I
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
am not an expert on the legalese and I
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
don't understand as it my expertise is
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
not in understanding the language of
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence so okay so
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
you would need to consult with your
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
certainly with your attorneys to figure
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
out where you would tie okay and uh
 
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
follow up but yeah one one follow-up
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
what where you articulated is what you
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
articulated is where you believe that
 
00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:51.350 align:start position:0%
articulated is where you believe that
this

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.130 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
that this bill would harm uh has a
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
potential of harming the child
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
what you are taking correct to us okay
 
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative disamoni
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.669 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
on uh line seven of the bill
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
it says a parent or legal guardian of a
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
minor child shall be entitled to have
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
full access to the medical records of
 
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's on line seven and eight and then
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
you go down to line 16 and it says
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh where when a health care provider has
 
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
determined by clear and convincing
 
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
evidence based upon articulable facts
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
that disclosure of Records to a parent
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
or legal guardian of a minor child is
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
likely to result in abuse and neglect
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
does that statement help you to
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
understand that if you as a physician
 
00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:03.620 align:start position:0%
who know your patient feel that it would
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
create abuse or neglect if you disclosed
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
and it's written in the law would that
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
help you to um to agree to this bill
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
again I'm not an expert in legalese and
 
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
I'm always worried when semantics become
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
involved so I would really need to
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Dr uh specific to
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
semantics when you are carrying out your
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
your job with your patients
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
and you and as you just stated that
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
determining a issue
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
that could put the child to rest should
 
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
the parents know but you also spoke of
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
medications they're from
 
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
with the parents paying the bill would
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
they not be aware or are they made aware
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
of the medications that would be
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
prescribed for their
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
their child
 
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
um that is true unfortunately we don't
 
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
have a good protection for insurance to
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
protect information for our patients
 
00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
sometimes that is true just a follow-up
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay well thank you for that
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
I'll stipulate to that reality but that
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
being the case does that
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
allow the parents then to come to you to
 
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
say why is this being prescribed and
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
then what would be the response
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
the parent actually identifies that on
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
the bill it's usually my patients with
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
cancer chemotherapy their bills are 70
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
pages long so somebody would have to go
 
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
through with a fine-tooth cone to
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
identify that
 
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative just one more for
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
clarification Patrick thank you for your
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
tolerance Mr chairman uh doctor in the
 
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
semantics of prescribing uh it's not
 
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
quantum physics to look at medications
 
00:29:58.850 --> 00:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:01.220 align:start position:0%
sexual disease
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
parents would make that's just suggest
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
they may know what that is
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
would that then precipitate them to come
 
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
to you to say why is this being
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
prescribed and then what would the
 
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
response be in that situation so again
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
we always try to encourage our teens to
 
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
communicate openly with their parents so
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
there would probably be another
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
discussion with the child the patient
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
the Adolescent patient to figure out
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
what is the best way to disclose the
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
information but I want the patient to be
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
responsible and in charge of that
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
information thank you
 
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Dr Kim for taking
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
time out of your day to drive all the
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
way down here and share your expertise
 
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:43.940 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
my question is about
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
um kind of normal normal procedures
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
with adolescents so I think that
 
00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
um it could be helpful for our committee
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
if we had a better understanding of
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
um kind of the developmental differences
 
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
between treating say an eight-year-old
 
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
and treating a 16 or 17 year old because
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
your example was an older older child
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
are there circumstances where
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
um you would approach that situation
 
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
differently as when it comes to talking
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
to parents or when it comes to making
 
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
the decision to have a child disclose to
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
their parents instead of having the the
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
pediatrician get in the middle of it uh
 
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
just kind of as a general sense children
 
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
under I think the age of about 11 or
 
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
less their parents have automatic access
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
to their medical record and
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
developmentally that seems appropriate
 
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
um again there's always exceptions to
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
the rule that you might have a 10 year
 
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
old that is developmentally Advanced for
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
their age and have some reason to
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
protect their information as a
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
pediatrician we would take that into
 
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.289 align:start position:0%
pediatrician we would take that into
account

00:31:53.289 --> 00:31:53.299 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
as the child becomes older it's also as
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
a pediatrician and the American Academy
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
of Pediatrics we also recognize we need
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
to teach our adolescents how to take
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
control of their own health care this is
 
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
a safe time to
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
teach adolescents to
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for their health and
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
to learn these steps it takes to be an
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
adult it's the it's not magic that
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes at age 18 you all of a sudden
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
have all these adult responsibilities we
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
somebody has to lead them to that
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to remind the committee
 
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
we have another committee rolling in at
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock so be brief and make it a
 
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:34.370 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock so be brief and make it a
question

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Dr Kim I
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to thank you for your work
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
because it's really important so thanks
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
and thank you Doctor uh chair recognizes
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.649 align:start position:0%
also from DH Matthew is it Hood
yes

00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.659 --> 00:32:57.169 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
we won't call you Jennifer because
 
00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:00.539 align:start position:0%
you're not in trouble and I'm not a
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
doctor so you don't have to fair enough
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record my name is
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood I'm the vice president of
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
government relations at Dartmouth health
 
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.430 align:start position:0%
government relations at Dartmouth health
um

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
and it's a pleasure to be here I'm here
 
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
to testify in opposition to how this
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
bill was brought in from the Senate to
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
your committee uh I'd reiterate
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
something that Dr Kim said and I love
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
semantics by the way so I hope to get
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
into some of the standards that we that
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
we've talked about so far
 
00:33:28.919 --> 00:33:29.870 align:start position:0%
we've talked about so far
um

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
as Dr Kim indicated we support parental
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
involvement in the care of their minor
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
child we encourage that
 
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
what we what we have a problem with is
 
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:42.740 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
in two ways first we're concerned that
 
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
it introduces a new standard that's
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with both state law
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
regarding abuse and neglect reporting
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
and federal HIPAA guidance so I'm going
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
to start with the state law regarding
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect reporting
 
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
providers and others are required to
 
00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.019 align:start position:0%
report suspected cases of abuse neglect
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
if they have a reason to suspect that a
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
child has been abused
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
additionally once a report is made dcyf
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
only needs to show and I think the child
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
Advocates spoke to this the child
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
Advocates office spoke to this probable
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
cause to move forward with its
 
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:20.030 align:start position:0%
cause to move forward with its
investigation

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
the child abuse statute defines probable
 
00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
causes facts and circumstances based
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
upon accurate and reliable information
 
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
including hearsay that would justify a
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable person to believe that a
 
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.589 align:start position:0%
reasonable person to believe that a
child

00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
subject to report under this chapter is
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence which is
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
the standard that's introduced in this
 
00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
bill as it was amended by the Senate is
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
a much higher standard than reasonable
 
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.669 align:start position:0%
a much higher standard than reasonable
belief

00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
belief
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
it is a standard of proof that is
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
greater than the preponderance of the
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
evidence which is generally more than 50
 
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.389 align:start position:0%
evidence which is generally more than 50
percent

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:54.950 align:start position:0%
percent
um

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
commonly used to prove civil liability
 
00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
though less than Beyond A Reasonable
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
Doubt standard used to use to prove
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
criminal liability
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
I looked at jury instructions in
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
preparation for this testimonial among
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
the descriptions of clear and convincing
 
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
is it's a very demanding standard
 
00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.470 align:start position:0%
is it's a very demanding standard
um

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
why is this an issue why is that an
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
issue it's an issue because it creates a
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
potential Conflict for reporting
 
00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.050 align:start position:0%
potential Conflict for reporting
individuals

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
if a reporter has to if a provider has
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
to report
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
if she has reason to suspect abuse she
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
could yet not meet the clear and
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
convincing standard and so release
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
medical records to someone who's seeking
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
for them under the clear and convincing
 
00:35:41.089 --> 00:35:41.099 align:start position:0%
that is creates the potential for harm
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to avoid with the
 
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
reasonable belief standard so I just
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize their different
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
standards here when the sponsor
 
00:35:49.569 --> 00:35:49.579 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill
 
00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:53.099 align:start position:0%
he referenced reasonableness but that's
 
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
not accurate this bill is clear and
 
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
convincing which goes exactly to
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
represent representative Raymond's point
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
that she raised which is it's a
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
different standard that creates a
 
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.810 align:start position:0%
different standard that creates a
conflict

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore it's inconsistent as you
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
noted Mr chairman with Federal HIPAA
 
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
guidance which provides that disclosure
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
of medical records need not be made when
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
the covered entity has a reasonable
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
belief that the individual has been or
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
may be subject to domestic violence
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect by such person
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
or treating such a person as a personal
 
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative could endanger that
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
individual so that's my first concern is
 
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
different standards that are used here
 
00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:29.099 align:start position:0%
the second concern in the in the
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
legislation as amended relates to the
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
provision about documenting the
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
determination in the medical record when
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
suspected abuse or neglect is reported
 
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
to dcyf the the report includes quote
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
the specific information indicating
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
neglect or the nature and extent of the
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
child's injuries among other things the
 
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
info in the report becomes part of the
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
case record which is confidential under
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
the child protection act
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
if the rationale is already being
 
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
reported why is it necessary to include
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
in the medical record
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
if the purpose
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
is to require reporting upon such
 
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
determination to deny record access then
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
you could spell out in that situation a
 
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
provider must report because frankly if
 
00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:11.099 align:start position:0%
a provider is not reporting medical
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
records then they should be reporting
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect to dcyf so I don't
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
know if that's the intent of the of that
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
provision of the bill but if it is I
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
would just specify and clarify that
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman happy to answer
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
I have a question in discussing this
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
bill with my staff both counseling and
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
medical they understand
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
that tender age people need protection
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
from Bad actor parents they also
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
understand that parents need protection
 
00:37:45.069 --> 00:37:45.079 align:start position:0%
from bad acting professionals and both
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
medical and counseling staff of mine no
 
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
people to whom this applies this seems
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
to me to be leveling the playing field
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that there are
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
Bad actors in counseling and medical
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
professions I think when we draft
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
legislation to address Bad actors we we
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
create problems it's like that bad
 
00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:09.710 align:start position:0%
create problems it's like that bad
um

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
bad facts make for bad law so I don't
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
know that I agree with you and I
 
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
represent Dartmouth Health that the
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
providers of Dartmouth Health are Bad
 
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.390 align:start position:0%
providers of Dartmouth Health are Bad
actors

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
actors
 
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't agree with that
 
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.230 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't agree with that
none

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.069 align:start position:0%
none
um

00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll wait to see what Board of
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
Medicine does as they reform their
 
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.230 align:start position:0%
Medicine does as they reform their
reporting

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking me question my
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
question do you believe that this bill
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
is necessary
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
if their parents already have a good
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
relationship with their child children
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
do you believe that this bill is really
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
necessary but this is like
 
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.270 align:start position:0%
necessary but this is like
putting

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
putting
 
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.329 align:start position:0%
putting
another

00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:49.339 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
step to put a kitchen grains especially
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about Childs that
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
have been abused by the parents or
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
children that they have a mental issues
 
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
or mental disabilities
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative I
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
um parents do have access to their
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
children's medical records today
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
and if the legislature wants to codify
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
that wants to specify that I think
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
that's com but that's completely
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable what the issue that I have is
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
is it as I said creates conflicting
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson thank you for
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
coming so I'm a little bit confused and
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that you could help me out
 
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.950 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that you could help me out
here

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm hearing is
 
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
there are different levels of
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
involvement when it comes to children
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
and suspected abuse so it starts off at
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
a level that's very we just suspect it
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
so we could make a report and then
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
they'll do the investigation and then we
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
might come to the next level of that
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence or more likely
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
than not this is happening
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and then we go up the scale so that
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
would be at this level but as we move up
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
this scale the next one would be the
 
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
clear and concise evidence is am I not
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
getting that correctly
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
um preponderance of the evidence and
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence neither of
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
which exist with respect today with
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.089 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I thought I just had that here
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
um describing it when I looked it up
 
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.829 align:start position:0%
um describing it when I looked it up
um

00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
so I guess maybe clear this so it says
 
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
that preponderance of evidence a parent
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
shall be awarded custody unless dcyf
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrates a preponderance of evidence
 
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
so we're going back to that idea of
 
00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence and that's
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
where I'm getting that's my where I'm
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
getting confused because it seems like
 
00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
the more information we withhold from
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
the parents the more we push the parent
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
out of the child's life am I and again
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
you said you like semantics so I'm
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
hoping you can help me understand the
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
process so what I'm trying to articulate
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
and I apologize if I'm not doing so
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
effectively is that it seems to me that
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're this bill would create two
 
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.790 align:start position:0%
we're this bill would create two
standards

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
one is reasonableness with respect to if
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
there's Reasonable Suspicion of abuse a
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
report is made
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
this this bill would change that
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
standard with respect to disclosure of a
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
Miner's records to its parents to clear
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
and convincing
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
which is it's different standard than
 
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
reasonable person standards so the
 
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
scenario that could result is that
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
a provider has to make a report
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
because they suspect they have a
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion that there's abuse
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
and neglect okay
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
and yet they could still be required
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
to disclose those medical the miners
 
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
medical records because it doesn't
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
satisfy a clear and convincing standard
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
so there's inconsistency between those
 
00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.150 align:start position:0%
so there's inconsistency between those
two

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
and that would potentially lead to the
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
harm that you're trying to avoid
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
presumably I guess I guess that's where
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
my confusion then is coming in because
 
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:21.380 align:start position:0%
the last follow-up I'm sorry
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
because the last person who testified
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
just presented a lot of facts which
 
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
would actually be clear and convincing
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
evidence and a reason to withhold that
 
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
information so I guess I'm that's where
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'm mixing up and then so I'm looking at
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
this as of how
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
like I said pushing the parent more and
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
more out of the child's life until you
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
get to the Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
when the child can actually parents can
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
actually lose custody so
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's why I guess I'm seeing
 
00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:56.579 align:start position:0%
this as it should be somehow steps into
 
00:42:56.579 --> 00:42:59.030 align:start position:0%
this as it should be somehow steps into
um

00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
the clear and convincing evidence so
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
we've already passed the I guess that's
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking you to explain to me is
 
00:43:06.839 --> 00:43:07.849 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking you to explain to me is
that

00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:10.700 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
dcyf or whatever
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
what are the steps that goes through
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
before the as a parent continues to lose
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
more and more custody or information
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
about their children so I would defer to
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
dcyf with respect to the process after a
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
hearing is commenced with respect to
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights or any of
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
the things that that you're suggesting
 
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
and I think those are standards do
 
00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.250 align:start position:0%
and I think those are standards do
increase

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
I'm purely focusing on the the medical
 
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
record access and comparing it to the
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
basis that is needed to make a report to
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
dcyf in the first place and I think I
 
00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:48.380 align:start position:0%
think I hear what you're saying about a
 
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
graduated scale of standards in terms of
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
proceeding as the parents risk of loss
 
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.650 align:start position:0%
proceeding as the parents risk of loss
increases

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
increases
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
um but I'm only speaking to that front
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
part about a report
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
and the disclosure of medical records
 
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
and I think those standards should be
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
the same I appreciate representative all
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
that you have a different perspective
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
with respect to a scale in that space
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
But for these purposes I think the
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
um just one quick okay I'm just not I
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just going to go back and ask
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
again wouldn't you say when we cut the
 
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
parents out of giving them the records
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
and including them in the conversation
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
aren't we then a step away from
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
basically taking away custody from their
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
child aren't we now making them less
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
involved in the child's life
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
when when medical records are withheld
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
the reason for doing so is because
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
there's a fear of neglect and abuse
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
that's very subjective I would imagine
 
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
would you agree that that would be
 
00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
subjective if there's we're not based on
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
facts well I I think as I mentioned the
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
report to dcyf detailing the Reasonable
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
Suspicion for abuse includes the facts
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
and circumstances that led to that
 
00:45:02.339 --> 00:45:04.430 align:start position:0%
and circumstances that led to that
conclusion

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.569 align:start position:0%
conclusion
sure

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr hood for testifying the
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
chair is now moving on we're going to
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
call Paula minahan from the hospital

Association and you've got 22 copies of
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
items and you've asked to speak for
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
three minutes Mr chair
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh we're moving on
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
just quick question no not of the last
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
witness we're moving on to the next one
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking a question to the witness
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
I'm asking a question to you go ahead
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
when we got recognized to ask a question
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
we asked the first question right
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
and if we get recognized to us the
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
following question you have to give us
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
the right to us another question that
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
keeps speaking right uh to a point I do
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
have discretion on that if somebody is
 
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
starting to ask a series of questions I
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
just asking because I just noticed the
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
differences thank you
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
yes good good morning welcome thank you
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%

Association representing all our
 
00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:18.020 align:start position:0%
hospitals we are opposed to Senate Bill
 
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
253 relative to parental access to minor
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
child's medical records as amended by
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to just give you
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
some context and I see representative um
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
McDonald good morning
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
um the there was a similar bill in in
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald's committee
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
housed in human services
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 406 we did testify on that
 
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
bill in February and due to several
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
concerns raised during the hearing by
 
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and after further
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
discussions with the sponsor that bill
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
was retained I mentioned that because
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
they it um Senate Bill 253 is is similar
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
in scope I guess I would say
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
um then when 253 was originally her
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
heard in Senate Judiciary the vote was
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
to re-refer the bill however it was
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
voted to be amended as you see it today
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the Senate so we um
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
didn't we had we have a number of
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
concerns we were not able to testify on
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
that version that hence why we are here
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
today I do want to State again as Dar as
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood from Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
said that we are in support of the
 
00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
general statement of purpose of the bill
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
and the vast majority of parents
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely are acting in their child's
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
best interest the reason there are laws
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
protecting the rights of minors and
 
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
again this is um age 12 and older to 21.
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely are acting in their child's
 
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
but um the reason there are rights for
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
minors are for the exceptions when
 
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
parents may not be acting in their
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
child's best interests so in order to
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
ensure that the rights of minors are
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
protected we do not have and that we do
 
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
not have conflicting dcyf reporting
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
requirements and inconsistencies with
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
federal laws we are asking that the
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee if they choose to ultimately
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
move this bill forward that you amend
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
the bill and I did articulate some
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
suggested amendments um to the bill and
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
I am happy to articulate those but
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
they've pretty much have already been
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
discussed prior we do have concerns with
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
the clear and convincing evidence again
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
it um it is setting a separate standard
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
so we believe it should be replaced with
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
reasonably believes and you can read our
 
00:48:38.819 --> 00:48:39.730 align:start position:0%
reasonably believes and you can read our
language

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:39.740 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
there we did add some language relative
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
to to HIPAA and I I attached a HIPAA
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
Privacy Rule q a right from the federal
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
government so I thought that would be
 
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.630 align:start position:0%
government so I thought that would be
helpful

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
um for you and what else
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
um and then adding another letter when
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
records or treatment of the minor are
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
directed by a court of competent
 
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:07.460 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so to add that
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
and again these are these changes are
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
intended to ensure Clarity for all
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
parties and provide consistent
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
application of the current state and
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
federal laws and regs that are in place
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
to protect minor children and we're
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the committee
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
um if you are so inclined to draft an
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
amendment that would include these
 
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
suggested changes and happy to answer or
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions Miss minahan
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
if we were to get language that would
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
help those of us who like the bill and
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
those of you who don't find that golden
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
sweet spot in the middle and I were to
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
convince the speaker to take this bill
 
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
out of my committee and give it to
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative chairman McDonald who has
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
a very similar Bill to this would we all
 
00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:56.540 align:start position:0%
be happy
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
some of us would be happy we again we
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
with these changes we are fine with the
 
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
bill I I think and I know representative
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
Perez I think had the question earlier
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
why do we need or someone did over here
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
um representative representative Perez
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
um why do we need this bill and I think
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
we are we had a long discussion
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative kovalt is the sponsor of
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 406 and he and I have had
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
many conversations about his bill it
 
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
basically and I think Matthew said this
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
it basically is codifying what is
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
currently in law but I think as a parent
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
and I am a parent and a grandparent I
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
think this is really important to
 
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
articulate in the law what their rights
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
are as a parent of a minor and I think
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
of my well my children are now
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
well over there now parents themselves
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
but when they were 12 I thought would I
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
really um I didn't realize I didn't have
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
access to their medical records I I
 
00:50:57.359 --> 00:50:58.430 align:start position:0%
access to their medical records I I
fortunately

00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
fortunately
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
um had great relationships and my my
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
husband and I with my children they um
 
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
so that but now I I've learned
 
00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:09.260 align:start position:0%
um why we need these laws and of course
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
I would want their them to have
 
00:51:12.059 --> 00:51:13.190 align:start position:0%
I would want their them to have
protection

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
um and if my daughter was looking as a
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
16 year old looking to get um birth
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
control that is really none of my
 
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.349 align:start position:0%
control that is really none of my
business

00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and I respect the medical
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
professional to have that relationship
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
with her so but I think it's really
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
important as a parent I understand what
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
your rights are and what your children
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
your parent your minor children's rights
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
are because they have rights too so I
 
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
think it actually is helpful to put this
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
into law we just cannot have two
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
different standards and Matthew being a
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
lawyer would did a much better job than
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
I I could to articulate why we would
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
have those um the concerns with those
 
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
separate standards but um that so I'm
 
00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you and to come up
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that all stakeholders
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
can be and the committee be supportive
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
of I'm ashamed to admit I don't know the
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
contents of 406 although I should how
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
close is it to this bill it articulate
 
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's actually you know a good question
 
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
um it it has a lot of the same
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
um um well as
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
the the con the the concept is the same
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
the words are different
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
um we don't use some of the words
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
completely clear and convincing it's um
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's less it's less legalese it
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that separate standard the
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
issue with 406 and I think this is
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
important because I think Senator Innis
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
um alluded to this that there are
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
anecdotes of individuals not having
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
access to their children's records you
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
have it's important and this is where
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative kofault um has some
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
concerns with 406 and so
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
held it or held it in representative
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
McDonald's committee there's also a
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
portal um now we have portals these laws
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
were written or the you know some of the
 
00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:05.099 align:start position:0%
medical records laws were written prior
 
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
to portals portals are excerpts from the
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
medical record and I think anyone that
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
uses one understands you can get your
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
lab results you can get you can just
 
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
have chats with your providers it's it's
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
a great tool
 
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
um but there are certain
 
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
um requirements and regulations relative
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
to portals that are um separate from
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
access to medical records medical
 
00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
records are is a full medical record and
 
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
the providers are able to separate the
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
mental health com the pieces of the
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
medical record that should not be shared
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
with a with a parent of a minor the
 
00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:44.099 align:start position:0%
portal is a little bit more nuanced and
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
more difficult so when people say they
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
have anecdotal evidence that their
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
access to the medical records was not
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
provided the evidence that has been to
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
me and I have done a lot of research
 
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
with representative co-fault on this and
 
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
he I think um would would concur
 
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
the issues that were raised are about
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
the portal not about access to medical
 
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
records two different things and I just
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
wanted to to point that out happy to
 
00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:11.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask one of Representative
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald
 
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.809 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald
um

00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
I don't have HB 406 with me
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative I'm Mr chairman I'm sorry
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
but go ahead but you do recall roughly
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's on this subject and it was retained
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
for further work it was and I'm almost
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
hearing that there's some good intent
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
behind this bill I mean I am still
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
concerned about bad professional actors
 
00:54:44.089 --> 00:54:44.099 align:start position:0%
as I am bad parents sure and I am just
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
wondering within the committee here if
 
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
we may wish to retain this bill and
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
figure out a way where the two bills
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
which are so close could be done in
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
tandem so the language that emerges from
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
both of them is not contradictory that
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
would make sense sure
 
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.970 align:start position:0%
would make sense sure
um

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:05.339 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman after you get your
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
decision on that question I have a
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
question of the person testifying well
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
it will it will make a difference in
 
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
what happens next could I see a very
 
00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.870 align:start position:0%
what happens next could I see a very
informal

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
informal
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
bobble head up and down or not on
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding with this to exec it either
 
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
today or soon versus
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
retaining it and working on it in tandem
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
how many would think retaining it and
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
working on it in tandem I think hands
 
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay I see
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh oh sure
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
yeah your seat filling yeah how many
 
00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
want to get this one done one way or the
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay well it seems that uh a motion to
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
retain would carry
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind any questions
 
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
addressed to the remaining and present
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
Witnesses should have that in mind
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative disamoni thank you Mr
 
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.790 align:start position:0%
representative disamoni thank you Mr
chairman

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
um if you would be so kind to help me
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.410 align:start position:0%
with this
um

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
a very very very very very long time ago
 
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
when I was the mother of a teenager
 
00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
whose friend went and got
 
00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
whose friend went and got
um

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.690 align:start position:0%
um
some

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
some medication with a doctor and had a
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
severe allergic reaction
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
because the doctor refused to give the
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
file because during the interview the
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
kids said
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
oh my God if my mother finds out about
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
this she'll kill me
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
so the doctor refused the child ended up
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
in intensive care unit due to the
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
reaction that she had was was that an
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate decision when there were no
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
reports of child abuse before or after
 
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question but I
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
don't feel
 
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
um authorized to answer that question
 
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
that that to me is more of a medical
 
00:57:19.609 --> 00:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
question but it was in the I mean the
 
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
health professional had to make a
 
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
determination and they wanted to protect
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
um and um but that is a very unfortunate
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh Ms minnehan would you believe that by
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
Vice chair it's just shown me the
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
language of House Bill 406 and I
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
discovered two things uh there will be
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
there is conflicting language and number
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
two I'm a co-sponsor of 406 and
 
00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's been it's been a long session
 
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much thank you
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
oh sorry you hadn't left and I caught it
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative panic
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for allowing me to
 
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:08.579 align:start position:0%
ask this one question
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
in the case of surgeries
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
I remember a case when my son had
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
surgery and he had an allergic reaction
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
to the anesthesia
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
his allergist wanted him to
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
um wanted us to find out what they gave
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
him so if he ever had
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
future surgeries not to give him that
 
00:58:34.609 --> 00:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
medication the hospital would not give
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not an abusive parent I didn't fall
 
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:44.420 align:start position:0%
into that category
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
I think maybe the hospital was afraid
 
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
there was going to be a lawsuit
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
so they held back
 
00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
so are there other reasons why you think
 
00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
that they would want to hold back
 
00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:00.299 align:start position:0%
information to parents because of
 
00:59:00.299 --> 00:59:01.970 align:start position:0%
information to parents because of
lawsuits

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:02.630 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
um

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question either but
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
what I can answer is and this came up
 
00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:08.420 align:start position:0%
during 406
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
discussions there are consent form again
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
as a minor the the individual gets has
 
00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
rights as they turn 12 and consent a
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
consent form and I have a big file on
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
406 and happy to pull that out and share
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
with you but there are protocols that um
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
to get consent from the minor to release
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
records to the parents um and that's
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
probably what was needed
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
um but I I can't obviously answer
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
specific questions but we've been
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
talking about mental health
 
00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.609 align:start position:0%
talking about mental health
um

00:59:46.609 --> 00:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
treatment but yes in order to release
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
medical records there is a consent form
 
00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
that is required of the minor child to
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for yourself and Emma savini
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
you have 22 copies to hand out and you
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
asked for two minutes and you've heard
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
the motion I'm likely to make in a few
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
minutes so that may significantly change
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.750 align:start position:0%

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for hearing
 
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%

well-being of all Granite Staters in
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
light of the motion you are anticipating
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
making I will be super brief we are here
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
in opposition to Senate Bill 253 for the
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
similar reasons that I've been
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
articulated already
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
but mostly because I just want to
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
reiterate confidentiality protects the
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
health of minors by promoting a youth
 
01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.609 align:start position:0%
health of minors by promoting a youth
driven

01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
driven
 
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
and safe environment for children to
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
receive Mental Health Care our children
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
are in a mental health crisis as we've
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
seen from yrbs data and you'll see in my
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
testimony there is it has been an
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
increase in depression anxiety and
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
suicidality amongst our minors so
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
anything we can do as
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
um parents
 
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
um guidance for minors and you as
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
legislators can do to promote more
 
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
effective and access to mental health
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
care for our miners the better I think
 
01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.490 align:start position:0%
care for our miners the better I think
um

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
again we think that this bill is very
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
similar to 406 and if you are able to
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
retain it in committee work on it and
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
get some language that helps balance the
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
rights of those minors to have privacy
 
01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:48.059 align:start position:0%
in their mental health treatment with
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
the rights of parents to obviously
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
parent their children and be effective
 
01:01:54.289 --> 01:01:54.299 align:start position:0%
parents that would be excellent happy to
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
saying no questions thank you so much
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your written testimony
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%

too and you've heard
 
01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:20.579 align:start position:0%
what's about to transpire so
 
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
if I could ask you to be very brief
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson members of the
 
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Holly Stevens I'm
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
the director of public policy at Nami
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Nami New Hampshire is a
 
01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:34.700 align:start position:0%
Grassroots organization
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
that whose mission is to improve the
 
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
lives of all people impacted by mental

education and advocacy
 
01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of Nami New Hampshire I am
 
01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
here today and opposed as the bill came
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
over from the Senate and I will be brief
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
you know our main concern is therapy
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
notes not therapy assessments not
 
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.089 align:start position:0%
notes not therapy assessments not
um

01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
treatment plans but the actual therapy
 
01:03:00.849 --> 01:03:00.859 align:start position:0%
notes themselves is our main concern
 
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
knowing that if a child
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
thinks or is told that the parent will
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
have access to those therapy records it
 
01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
may have a chilling effect on
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
the uh on their willingness to talk with
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
the therapist and it could really impact
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
that therapeutic relationship so that is
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
our main concern we do have we also
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
testified on House Bill 406 and had some
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions also agree that working with
 
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
the committee on this we think that we
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
can come to some sort of an agreement on
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
both sides to get something moving
 
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
forward either this session or next and
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
you and this concludes the hearing on
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
House Bill 253 and I now open the exec
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 253 and the chair
 
01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
makes a motion to retain the bill do I
 
01:03:59.450 --> 01:03:59.460 align:start position:0%

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'm very opposed to the bill
 
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
I'm very opposed to the bill
um

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
I think it's a mess
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
I don't I haven't heard anybody come in
 
01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
and say this
 
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
you know uh say we've had a problem we
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
need to fix this problem everyone has
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
come in and said we don't want this bill
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
except for the sponsor
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
so I think we should just set it aside
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
and work on the other bills that we have
 
01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
which are many
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh in that are retained and there's
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
already another bill to work on this in
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
