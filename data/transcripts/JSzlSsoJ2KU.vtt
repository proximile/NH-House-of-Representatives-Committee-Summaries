thank you uh mr chair uh thank you
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
barrett christina executive director of
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school boards
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
association we are opposed to house bill
 
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.749 align:start position:0%
association we are opposed to house bill
1147.

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
1147.
 
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
to be clear we're not opposed uh to the
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
bill because we don't think the
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
inclusion of curricular materials
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
reading lists
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
students survey dates and questions are
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
not public records indeed we believe
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
they are public records which is why we
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is unnecessary um
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 914
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
list what records are are available for
 
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
public inspection and the process of
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
that there's a definition of
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
governmental records and public records
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
and rsa 91a 1a i believe it is
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
so these these materials are already
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
public records there's no need to carve
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
out specific types of records that are
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
public records because they're already
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
public records
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
the right to know law applies to all
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
public bodies towns cities schools
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
village districts so on and so forth
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's no other provision in the right
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
to know law that i'm aware of that
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
carves out specific exceptions for
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
certain types of public records so i
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
don't know why schools should be any
 
00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.870 align:start position:0%
don't know why schools should be any
different

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.469 align:start position:0%
different
additionally

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
we have a provision in rsa 186 colon 11
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
a paragraph 9 c and that's roman numeral
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
9 c
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
and it says this talks about
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
objectionable course material about
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
curricular materials and books and
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
whatnot that's being taught in public
 
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.950 align:start position:0%
whatnot that's being taught in public
schools

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
there's a line that says to the extent
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
practicable a school district shall make
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum course materials available to
 
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
parents or legal guardians guardians for
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
review upon request
 
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
well this that statute only limits it to
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
parents or legal guardians the reality
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
is if anybody were to call a
 
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent and ask to see
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
curricular materials reading lists
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
student survey dates and questions
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
we would provide them anyway even
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
without this provision necessarily being
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
so no one disputes that these are our
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
public records we already have
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
provisions in other law that makes them
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
available to parents
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
and there's no specific carve out for
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
other types of public records for any
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
other type of public body so we think
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
the bill is unnecessary we'd ask you to
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
find it in expedient to legislate and i
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
the committee may have
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative walper
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea what prompted this
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill i mean it seems we don't normally
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
get bills unless there's some kind of uh
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
i want to say pretty egregious violation
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
of the law
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
so do you have any idea any knowledge of
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
where these
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
issues regarding these things have been
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
an issue in our state i do thank you
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
very much for the question
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative since the quote unquote
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination provisions that were
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
included in house bill 2 last year
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
alleging that school districts are
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
teaching things like critical race
 
00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:34.070 align:start position:0%
teaching things like critical race
theory

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
theory
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
and other allegations
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
about what's being taught in our public
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
schools we've seen repeated
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
voluminous expensive timely right to no
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
law requests across the state to
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
view curricular materials to review
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
teacher professional development
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
materials so on and so forth so
 
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
we believe that
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
this language was probably introduced
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to some of the issues
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
we've seen with the language that was
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
included in house bill 2 last year
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you

the two school districts also apply to

uh agree with what he's presented to you

the rsa 91a definition of governmental

specific language that has been added
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
with this bill the broad language
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
defining records should not be
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%

if the legislature starts adding

package i gave you i provided you with
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
rsa 33a which is the municipal
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
disposition and retention schedule this
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
document provides a list of specific
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
documents and document types to be
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
maintained for a specific time period
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
so on the town side there's an rsa for
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
the disposition of municipal records and
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
it includes a schedule that consists of
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
roughly 170 roman numeral records
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
that are public records and have to be
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
maintained according to a schedule
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
relative to school documents rsa 189
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
colon 29a
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
delineates record retention and
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
disposition as it applies to school
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
boards superintendents teachers and
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
truant officers and i've attached
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
that rsa to this package as well
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
boards are responsible now what is
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
interesting with this is that it does
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
not include a
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
list of records like the municipal side
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
does so it's interesting at the state
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
level that there is a list of records
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
that are to be maintained but at the
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
school level they leave it up to the
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent's office primarily to
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
determine those list of records and make
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
it available
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
and boards are responsible for setting
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
direct and policy to direct the
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent to establish a retention
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
schedule for all official school records
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
i don't know how widely it's being done
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
but in nashua i went and got the
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
retention schedule
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
and i attached it here
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
for you to see what's in here and i
 
00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
for you to see what's in here and i
think

00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a complete list and what it
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't include really are the curricula
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
or more school related materials that
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
are in the classroom that parents are
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
governmental records mean any
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
information created accepted or obtained
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%

quorum or majority thereof or any public
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
agency in furtherance of its official
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
duty without limiting the foregoing the
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
term governmental records includes any
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
written communication or other
 
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.910 align:start position:0%
written communication or other

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
whether in paper electronic or other
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
physical form received by a quorum or
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
majority of a public body in the
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
furtherance of its official function
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
whether a meeting or outside a meeting
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
of the body
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
the term governmental records shall also
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
include public records so that's a very
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
broad definition public bodies include
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
by definition any school district or sau
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
and all specific exemptions are defined
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
under rsa 91a to provide the
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
restrictions that apply to records for
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure so we think that rsa 91a
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
should be kept in the broadest possible
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
terms the language we should be listing
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
things in here we'll end up with a
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
pretty unruly document that will
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
probably never be complete and i think
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
we should encourage potentially looking
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
at section 189 colon 29a
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
at the state level listing the records
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
public school records like we do for the
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
uh municipal side the the city side i'm
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
not certain why one does it and one does
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
not but i know for sure that i think
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
what director christina director um
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
christina explained um
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
that this is a fallout from
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
people concerned about
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
dei and
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
critical race theory being introduced
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
into the classroom and they want to see
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
these curriculums and i don't think
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
these curriculums are as widely
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
available as they should be the one
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
thing in nashua i asked parents where do
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
you get a curriculum if you want it um
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
they couldn't tell me that that they
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
could go to a school and get a
 
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
could go to a school and get a
curriculum

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
you go to the grade level that your
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
child's in if they're in elementary
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
school go to the elementary school or
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
the middle school the high school
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
one of them said you have to go to the
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent's office but the
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
curricula being approved at our school
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
board tables sometimes it's approved
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
without the curriculum being present
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
because it's quote in the computer so
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
the parents aren't seeing it because
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's digitally not available in a
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
meeting so that's creating some stress
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
so i understand why this is happening
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
but i think we could add clarity but not
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
in rsa 91a thank you
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
documents are already covered by the
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%

that this is unnecessary
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
that these
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
records are widely available and
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
to change 91a
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.510 align:start position:0%
nice to see you all today uh my bill
1322

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
1322
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
is a fairly
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
simple bill
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me i'm just pulling up what i
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure i cover here for you
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's
 
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.510 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's
basically

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's a revision in 91a
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
and the bill would allow the sharing of
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
personnel records between agencies so
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
that governmental personnel who have had
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
maybe a problem
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
could not escape to another agency
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
because the other agency wouldn't know
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement
 
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.750 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement
um

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's where i thought of it
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
originally and now it's just it fits for
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
all of your other places if there's
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
somebody say for example um that did
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
maybe dubious at one uh post
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
had it in their personnel file currently
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
if they decide to move on or go to a
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
different jurisdiction
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
that doesn't follow with them or it
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
isn't available for the folks who are
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
hiring them to consider and that's all
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
it is it's just to you know give
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
everybody a an equal opportunity to see
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
who it is that they're actually hiring
 
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.589 align:start position:0%
who it is that they're actually hiring
so

00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll take any questions
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%

representative

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
for taking my question a quick question
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
are you talking just about personnel
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
files disciplinary files internal
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
investigation files
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
or you mentioned personnel files because
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
i believe already if a
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
candidate for a position applies and
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
signs a waiver
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
a another agency does have the right to
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
look at their personnel file
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
i'm the vice president of right to know
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and we are opposed to hb
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
1322 modifying the government records
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
exemption under rsa 91a colon 5.
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
the this amendment allows a public body
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
to share personnel records with other
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies or departments for
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of hiring the phrase other
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
agencies or departments is not defined
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
and could include state federal or
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
international agencies
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the event that a personnel file is
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
not correct
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
misinformation could be widely
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
disseminated and correcting that
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
information may not be possible
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
in addition we believe the language is
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
too broad and does not define what type
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
of personnel records can be disclosed
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
will job reviews be provided to a hiring
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
company should performance disagreements
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
between a supervisor and subordinate be
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
would available fully released to the
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
hiring department or agency but the
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
internal disciplinary records could be
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
released the partial release of records
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
for an unjust termination could destroy
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
a person's ability to obtain employment
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
this broad language added to a colon 5
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
section 4 could have an unjust and
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
detrimental impact on a person's future
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
employment and that's why we're opposed
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
we just feel it's too broad
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
the next speaker will be sheriff bill
 
00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:28.630 align:start position:0%
the next speaker will be sheriff bill
wright

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
good morning chair thank you
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
representatives for allowing me to speak
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'm testifying in favor of this bill um
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
as a hiring authority um just to give
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
you a little background uh my name is
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
bill wright i'm the sheriff elected
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
sheriff of belmont county i've been a
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer now for 24 years
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
i am in my first term of uh being a
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
sheriff and i am the hiring authority
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
for my agency
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
as it relates to uh hiring
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
um because of my tenure with the law
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement community i've seen good
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
employees and i've seen bad employees
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i've been involved in background
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
checks of some of these employees where
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
um if we had been able to see some of
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
these uh files before we hired these
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
people we could have identified them as
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
not being a a viable or a good candidate
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
and um and that we could have probably
 
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.750 align:start position:0%
and um and that we could have probably
um

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to not not employ
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
these people and and to uh keep them
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
within the public trust uh so again i'm
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
i'm in support in support of this bill
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
and uh part of that reason is because i
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
as a hiring authority i should have
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
access to these records and then make my
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
own decision as to whether or not this
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
candidate is a viable employee or not
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
we all have at some point worked for a
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
bad supervisor that may have had it out
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
for us because of differences but that
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
that can be documented and that can be
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
refuted by the employee uh through
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
documentation and uh it opens the door
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
for that conversation should i decide to
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh to either hire or not hire that
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
employee or prospective employee i think
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
that this is important um
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
information i have even when it comes to
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
the disclosures of
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
any type of settlement that was done
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
let's face it insurance companies uh do
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
these settlements it's not the the
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
entity that employs uh most of the time
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
and that there's information contained
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
within a a uh
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
investigation investigative file that
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
should be accessible to that uh
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know potential uh hiring authority
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
to make that determination whether or
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
i have i'm open for questions should
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
anybody have any
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
questions for the sheriff yes
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
representative trottier
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you sheriff
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
right quick question um on that
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
so these files that you're talking about
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
would the former or current employee
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay so when it comes to internal
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
affairs uh there's formal and informal
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
um internal affairs files that can be
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
contained so if we get a generic
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
complaint about an employee sometimes as
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
a fax finding
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us and we'll go ahead
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
and start looking into the matter
 
00:54:11.839 --> 00:54:13.030 align:start position:0%
and start looking into the matter
um

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
an example of that would be a complaint
 
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.150 align:start position:0%
an example of that would be a complaint
about

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
an officer running a red light
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
at that point we go ahead and start
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
looking at first off uh a quick
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
investigation into whether or not the
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
officer was on duty or the deputy was on
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
duty whether or not they were in that
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
generic area we may not open up a true
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
internal affairs investigation to where
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
there would be disciplinary cause for
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
that perhaps they were headed to
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
a location um or what have you that they
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
needed to get there as an emergency type
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
situation but it didn't warrant the blue
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
lights at that given time so we may not
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
um necessarily create a we want to
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
create a document that shows that a
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
complaint came in and that we did a
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
cursory investigation but at the same
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
time it didn't raise to the level of uh
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
where we're going to discipline a person
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
and involve the unions and
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
in that type of process so um would that
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
be uh there and available well it could
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
be and it would have um
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
information contained in there that that
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know it ended at the
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
cursory investigation portion of it that
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
it didn't raise to the level of a true
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
investigation so yes those documents
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
could be available it would have no
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process but again if these
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
started stacking up
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
it gives us an idea of kind of
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
what the employee's doing and maybe we
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
need to look into it further so that
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
i i have a question and
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
that's i i when
 
00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:43.670 align:start position:0%
that's i i when
you're

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
you're is your concern here employment
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
with regard to officers or is it
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
employment with regard to
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
none and
 
00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.710 align:start position:0%
none and
officers

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
my concern has to do with the police
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
side of the the field so i i can only
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
speak of
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh portions in general
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
because those are predominantly the
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
people that i hire i do hire uh civilian
 
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.150 align:start position:0%
people that i hire i do hire uh civilian
staff

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
on occasion that would be our
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
dispatchers or our administrative
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
assistants or clerks
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
which again we would want to obtain
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
those records as to any type of
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
internal affairs type situations in
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
order to to weigh in or to have some
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
form of a weight to say
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
whether these people are a viable
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
candidates or not whether they have
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
integrity issues or not things that
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
might that i might question at that
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
given time and uh we do uh polygraph a
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the employees that are uh
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
hired by us so that might be catalyst to
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
questions that we would ask during the
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
polygraph examination as well uh to to
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
determine truthfulness uh and in the law
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement field we are in light of the
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
public so uh and then with public
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
scrutiny on uh our jobs as we are i
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
think this just helps uh with the
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
transparency portions in the in building
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
and if i could just follow up on that
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
because i am under the impression or my
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
experiences that
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
police officers are generally well
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
vetted before they're hired by anyone
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
and including the polygraph
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
on occasion
 
00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.549 align:start position:0%
on occasion
but

00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
the police departments tend to be very
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
collegial in terms of sharing
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
information or that's been my experience
 
00:57:30.559 --> 00:57:31.430 align:start position:0%
information or that's been my experience
as

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh are you
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
indicating that there are
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
other agencies that
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let you know if there were
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
problems with an officer before you
 
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
attempted to hire them what i can tell
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
you in today's litigation society is
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
that a response that we traditionally
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
get from an agency
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that has a prospective candidate
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
that we're hiring or potentially hiring
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
and they have information but they
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
cannot share it is typically uh they
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
were employed here between these days
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
and there's no there's normally nothing
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
so you can kind of read between the
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
lines but that doesn't that does not
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
again we look for uh qualified
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
candidates to either qualify that
 
00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.430 align:start position:0%
candidates to either qualify that
they're

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
a prospective employee or disqualifying
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
them as a as an employee and these types
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
of records are what help us make that
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
determination to whether or not we
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
and to retain these people as employees
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
yeah one
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
one other question if i could
 
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.190 align:start position:0%
one other question if i could
the

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.630 align:start position:0%
the
uh

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
just to get back to the the lorry issue
 
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.230 align:start position:0%
just to get back to the the lorry issue
issue

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
the typical lori
 
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.589 align:start position:0%
the typical lori
list

00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
which has been there in the past which
 
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.390 align:start position:0%
which has been there in the past which
now

00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.670 align:start position:0%
now
will

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
be more public
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
has that been available in the past in
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
terms of determining whether somebody
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
does have that trustworthiness issue or
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
some other blemish on their record that
 
00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:07.190 align:start position:0%
some other blemish on their record that
would

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.470 align:start position:0%
would
would

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
cause you to have concerns with regard
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
to their employment
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
if a person was entered on the ees list
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
we would have access to knowing that
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
that person was on the list or not and
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
that can weigh into the factors not
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
everyone on the ees list is
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
considered a liar or considered
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know an abusive officer or what have
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
you so there's criteria that that gets a
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
person or an officer listed on that list
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
and then we have to determine what
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
based on inquiries based you know to why
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
why they're on the list and there could
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
be a multitude of factors that that
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
they're on the list then an employer can
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
make that decision if they want to hire
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
okay are there other questions for the
 
00:59:54.559 --> 00:59:56.870 align:start position:0%
okay are there other questions for the
sheriff

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
sheriff
 
00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.829 align:start position:0%
sheriff
yes

00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
good morning sheriff um i have a
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
question about the um
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
polygraph part of the interview process
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that polygraph
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
reports don't stand up in court as
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
evidence correct
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
as far as a criminal investigation
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes criminal criminals um so
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
what value is a polygraph in the context
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
of the hiring process it's an
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
investigative tool that we utilize
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
because even though that we're not using
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
it in a in a criminal case manner
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
this has to do with uh the employment of
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
a person so people are more apt to tell
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
us the truth as to what's going on in
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
to coincide with the information that
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
we've gone out and physically obtained
 
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.349 align:start position:0%
we've gone out and physically obtained
or

01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
inquired about so it's a supporting
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
factor it's another tool how much weight
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
would you follow up thank you how much
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
weight do you think a polygraph would um
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
hold in a in the entire hiring decision
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's up to the hiring
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
authority i i don't um
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
i really can't answer that i think that
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
if a person had
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
shown deception within a polygraph
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
examination and i'm only speaking on
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself as a hiring authority
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
um that would generate more questions
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
to reinterview this person and and to
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
kind of dig deeper into what is going on
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
with this process
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you for your testimony today
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman uh for
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
the record brian hawkins uh nea new
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh
 
01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.270 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh
uh

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
we we share uh some of the concerns that
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
described earlier with respect to this
 
01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:14.230 align:start position:0%
described earlier with respect to this
bill

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
but so i'll i won't repeat those but
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'll add just
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
first i think there there is a little
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
bit that is confusing to this in terms
 
01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:22.710 align:start position:0%
bit that is confusing to this in terms
of

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
you know what is the definition of a
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
governmental agency so for example if
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
i'm a teacher and i see a
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
an interesting job i want to take at the
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
department of education does it mean
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
that those two
 
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.829 align:start position:0%
that those two
agencies

01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
if they're included in as agencies
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
are part of this um but presuming that
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
they are because we're talking about
 
01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:43.990 align:start position:0%
they are because we're talking about
uh

01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.390 align:start position:0%
uh
91a

01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
91a
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
i think this is in the wrong place to be
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh this i think this probably belongs in
 
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:53.990 align:start position:0%
uh this i think this probably belongs in
our

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
labor or employment statutes rather than
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
in 91a
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
over the last several years the
 
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.789 align:start position:0%
over the last several years the
department

01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
of education state board of education
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the legislature has undergone some
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
numerous changes to
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
the the laws to
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
they are adding uh
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
provisions to
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
what's called section five violations
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
these are violations that if you are
 
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.829 align:start position:0%
these are violations that if you are
applying

01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
applying
 
01:03:25.839 --> 01:03:26.789 align:start position:0%
applying
um

01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
to be a teacher and
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
will have committed
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
any of these you you cannot be
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
employable by a school district
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire so i think
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
existing statutes
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
that deal with those types of issues um
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the other the other question i'll
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
just i'll go back to my example of the
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
teacher applying for the doe
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
does does everything in that personnel
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
file need to be shared with
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
the other employer
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not necessarily that it does if i've
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
been a teacher for 10 years
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
or all my evaluations need to be
 
01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.390 align:start position:0%
or all my evaluations need to be
shared

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
each each employer has its own
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
application process
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
um and it if it were the other way
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
around you know that includes a criminal
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
history records check for for schools so
 
01:04:21.119 --> 01:04:23.910 align:start position:0%
history records check for for schools so
um

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
and then just to to to reference
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
something that was brought up earlier by
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative trotter of course if if
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh consents uh they can have their
 
01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.470 align:start position:0%
uh consents uh they can have their
personnel

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
file course um released so i think that
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
i'll close my testimony there and
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any questions i
 
01:04:49.039 --> 01:04:50.950 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any questions i
can

01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
is there if
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
if i could just uh
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
inquire the
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
i read in the paper about teachers who
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
have engaged in misconduct and
 
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.549 align:start position:0%
have engaged in misconduct and
frequently

01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
they've moved from one district to
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
their bad behavior in the prior
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
their prior
 
01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:17.990 align:start position:0%
their prior
job

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.109 align:start position:0%
job
wasn't

01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
made known to the
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
new organization that hired them
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
is there some other
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
solution to that problem because
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
apparently it
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
that seems to be a problem on occasion
 
01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.470 align:start position:0%
that seems to be a problem on occasion
right

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.349 align:start position:0%
right
um

01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.910 align:start position:0%
so i think
um

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
there have that issue has been
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
looked at at the
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
by the legislature by the state board
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
i apologize for not bringing those those
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
provisions with me but i'd be happy to
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
provide what what has been done to to to
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
try and get at that
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
again i'd go back to
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
i think some of those are employment
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
decisions specific to education and i
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's i don't know that
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
91a is the place that we are
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
that would make sense to to to
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative trottier
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
i know in law enforcement there's the
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
ee list or the lorry list is there
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
anything like that for teachers or other
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
public servants
 
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.029 align:start position:0%
public servants
um

01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
firefighters teachers or ems
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
public to the uh
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
available to the public so so relatively
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh i got two two parts there relatively
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
recently um
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
and and this uh this is actually
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
something i neglected to mention
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
with the chairs question is uh the state
 
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
board of education um
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh had established a code of ethics and
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
a code of conduct uh that that that
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
teachers are excuse me that any educator
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
with a certificate is required to
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
abide by
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
um and and also obligated to report on
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
um if there is a violation of that so so
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
so so that that is in place and then
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
there as i said there are there are
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
provisions within the certification
 
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.029 align:start position:0%
provisions within the certification
process

01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:07:17.039 --> 01:07:17.910 align:start position:0%
process
that

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i i'd say i don't
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
know as if you could equate it to like
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd say there's a similar
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
goal or intent there to do that i'd be
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
happy to provide the committee with that
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative langley
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question is it standard
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
procedure that anybody that's hired for
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
education has a criminal background
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
check done
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative trottier
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you for
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
just kind of follow up to the last
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative question um is it just a
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
kernel motor vehicle record or do they
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
do character checks as they do with
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
other public servants
 
01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.190 align:start position:0%
other public servants
it

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
it is a criminal history records check
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
and i will confess that i
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
i am not an expert on what
 
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.269 align:start position:0%
i am not an expert on what
gets

01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
gets
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
vetted through that it does include
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it does include not just
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
convictions though it includes
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
it includes anything that would show up
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
under that process um
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm happy to uh
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
follow up with you on on um what would
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
be included in that
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
other questions mr hawkins
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
seen then thank you for your testimony
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
good morning again margaret burns with
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
having heard the testimony here this
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
morning i just have two comments
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
relative to house bill 1322.
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
focused on this being needed
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
particularly for the hiring of law
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers and law enforcement
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
agencies and i would just point the
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee to legislation that was passed
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
just last year amending rsa chapter 41
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
so adding 41 section 9-c
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement candidate background
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
checks i don't know if that law
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
addresses the concerns that have been
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
raised here this morning but at least in
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
part it seems just a little bit
 
01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.310 align:start position:0%
part it seems just a little bit
redundant

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
my second comment would be that should a
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
provision like this pass
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
it probably does not belong in 91 a
 
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.310 align:start position:0%
it probably does not belong in 91 a
five

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
the right to know law of course is about
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
the public's ability to access records
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
not about the government's ability to
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
share records among itself or between
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
different governmental agencies so there
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
may be a need if a provision like this
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
needs to be passed there may be a need
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
to just locate it in an employment
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
related statute rather than in the right
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
to know law
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
and those are my comments happy to take
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who'd like to
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we'll close the hearing on
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
i have to admit that i did a poor job of
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
scheduling today this is our next
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
hearing isn't scheduled till half past
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
10 i
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
from from past experience i scheduled
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
the hearings for uh yesterday and today
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
on a wider interval because generally
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
these topics seem to get more
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
attention but
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
apparently i
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
did a bad job but anyway we'll
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
recess the committee until 10 30 when
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
we'll hear our next hearing on house
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.400 --> 01:12:25.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.840 --> 01:13:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
nice

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:49.760 --> 01:14:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:14.390 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.080 --> 01:15:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.239 --> 01:15:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.679 --> 01:16:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
we'll call this meeting of the house
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee back to order
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
our next item of business today
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
is a hearing on house bill 1408
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
requiring the refund of residential
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of that bill is
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
and we'll call upon the representative
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%

you
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
a well-intended bill uh helped drafted
 
01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
a well-intended bill uh helped drafted
by

01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.070 align:start position:0%
by
um

01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
housing um defendant lawyers actually
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
and and we
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
have seen and i'm not sure you're aware
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
of this but
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
um since there is a lack of supply for
 
01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.550 align:start position:0%
um since there is a lack of supply for
housing

01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
people that are showing apartments start
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
to take advantage
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
of of people applying
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing now is that people
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
tend to not only charge you an
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
application fee they will charge you to
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
see the apartment they'll charge you per
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
person so if you can't afford the
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
apartment and you have to have a
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
roommate situation if you want to see it
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
with your roommates they'll charge you
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
per roommate and then they'll charge you
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
on the application fee they'll charge
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
you per applicant
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
um so it's like
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's no standard rate which we would
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
think that a background check should be
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
standard across the board it shouldn't
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
it should be a
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know fifty dollars
 
01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.790 align:start position:0%
i don't know fifty dollars
is

01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
but we're seeing
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
application fees everywhere from a
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
hundred to two hundred dollars
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
and then we're seeing people hold on to
 
01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:06.229 align:start position:0%
and then we're seeing people hold on to
them

01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
for an excessive period amount of time
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
and what that does is it limits the
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
ability for a low-income person
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
that is trying to find a place to live
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
afford another application fee
 
01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:20.870 align:start position:0%
afford another application fee
to

01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
choose a different apartment so this
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
what this intends to do
 
01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:27.270 align:start position:0%
what this intends to do
is

01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
really fairly return somebody's money
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
if they're not going to be given this
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
apartment so that they can afford to
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm open to questions
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative yes
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
you refer to landlords as they
 
01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.669 align:start position:0%
you refer to landlords as they
and

01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
put out a blanket statement uh i'm
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that all landlords
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
are taking uh these fees and holding
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
them and such
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely not
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
i have a really good landlord but that
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't negate that there's good and bad
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
people everywhere
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
on every side of business on every side
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
of the aisle
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't mean that we shouldn't
 
01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:20.709 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't mean that we shouldn't
mitigate

01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
things that affect the good people and
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
and work together on a common issue that
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that really disparages our
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
our citizens and prevents them
 
01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:32.149 align:start position:0%
our citizens and prevents them
from

01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
being able
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's not all of them so
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
how large is the problem and how do you
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
know how large the problem is
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
well thank you so much for your question
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
um it is a pretty large problem because
 
01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.870 align:start position:0%
um it is a pretty large problem because
not

01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.910 align:start position:0%
not
there's

01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
not all landlords
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
are even in the state i know a lot of
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
people that have property here
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
that live in other states so they don't
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
really have
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
the meeting and the face-to-face
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
humanistic value that some of us are
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
provided my landlord lives in the same
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
district but i'm lucky
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
that he votes for me
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
so i am very blessed but not everybody
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
has a good landlord
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
that knows you personally
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people when they're moving from
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
place to place
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
they're relying off the whim of a new
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
person that they may not even know who's
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
renting to them and they might be
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with a
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
third party there's a lot of
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
discrepancies aboard
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
across the board that we're trying to
 
01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.350 align:start position:0%
across the board that we're trying to
basically

01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
streamline this
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
i would love it if everybody had a
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
landlord like my landlord
 
01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.030 align:start position:0%
landlord like my landlord
and

01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
we're seeing this as a very common
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
problem as i don't need to mention
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
you're probably very aware of the
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
homeless crisis in manchester
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
and that it is spreading throughout the
 
01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:11.510 align:start position:0%
and that it is spreading throughout the
state

01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
01:36:15.119 --> 01:36:16.470 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
horrigan

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
horrigan
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.550 align:start position:0%
um we
well

01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard from the two uh i guess
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
they're not lobbyists they're advocates
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
sitting behind you and
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly what they're going
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
to say but they're probably
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
they're probably
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
not in favor of
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
refunding the fees
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
why not just eliminate the fees
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
altogether so the issue of refunding
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
them is uh
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
so the issue of refunding them then
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
a reason not to go step further and
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
just ban the fees all together well
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative horgan i don't think with
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
all due respect i don't think that's
 
01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
fair to the landlord
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
a time that they are going to need to
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
spend doing a background check and
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay for a
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
background check
 
01:37:06.639 --> 01:37:07.590 align:start position:0%
background check
and

01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
i just
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
see both sides
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
i am a representative of not just people
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
other questions for the representative
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative langley
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair good morning
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:32.390 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
question

01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday we had multiple people
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
testifying around here around
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
section 8 vouchers and housing choice
 
01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.070 align:start position:0%
section 8 vouchers and housing choice
vouchers

01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
vouchers
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
i wondered for that population as they
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
are looking to rent an apartment
 
01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:46.870 align:start position:0%
are looking to rent an apartment
would

01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
hud or the housing authority provide
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
them these fees or is this money that
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
they have to come up with out of their
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
own resources
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
as i unders thank you so much for that's
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
a very good question as i understand it
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
they actually have to come up with these
 
01:38:00.719 --> 01:38:01.669 align:start position:0%
they actually have to come up with these
fees

01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:38:01.679 --> 01:38:02.470 align:start position:0%
fees
so

01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
that puts people that are
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
living from paycheck to paycheck in a
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
real bind and with again a lack of
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
housing if you don't have that money
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
then you can't apply for the next
 
01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.030 align:start position:0%
then you can't apply for the next
available

01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
rental property
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
so again all this does
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
is give a fair shake to people that are
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
finding a place to live
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:38.229 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:53.030 align:start position:0%

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm the same person i was
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday elliot berry from new
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire legal assistance
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
and thanks for the opportunity to come
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
before you again today
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
i just for those of you who were here
 
01:39:06.239 --> 01:39:09.030 align:start position:0%
i just for those of you who were here
yesterday

01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
just brief reminder actually for those
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
who weren't the context for this is a
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
housing market where the median rent for
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
a two bedroom apartment is
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
just shy of fifteen hundred dollars
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
including utilities a vacancy rate below
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
one percent
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
and a population of approximately 27 000
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
people who are paying over half their is
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
half their income for rent
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the backdrop and i just want
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
to walk through a typical new hampshire
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
legal assistance client say an income of
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
sixteen hundred dollars a month uh
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
social security disability
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh and she's being evicted from her
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
current department uh because the
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
landlord wants to rehab the bill the the
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
unit and raise the rent so she starts
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
searching for
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
a unit and because her income is 1600
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
she needs the most she could possibly
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
pay for a unit is 800
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
which out there is you know it's like
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
looking for gold
 
01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.950 align:start position:0%
looking for gold
um

01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
she probably needs to apply to at least
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
10 places and probably more to get
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
that rare apartment and even if she's
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
only charged 50 dollars
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
that you know each time that's five
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars if she's looked at ten
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
places in a month and she's going to
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
find that place she has to do more
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's five hundred dollars and then if
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
she's probably accepted
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
she's going to have to pay a security
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
deposit plus first month's rent
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
for many on fixed income the application
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
will stop the search mid-month
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
because they can't pay any more
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
application fees
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
which for some will mean a longer period
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
of homelessness
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
so what is the application fee for
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
often it's a credit check
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
a criminal records check and the
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
administrative cost of obtaining and
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
reviewing other data on the on the
 
01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.109 align:start position:0%
reviewing other data on the on the
tenant

01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
such as references
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
under hb 1408 the cost of the criminal
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
record check
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
or the credit check is does not have to
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
be refunded out of pocket costs
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
are kept and again as the sponsor
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned that's a fair thing to do
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
but the administrative cost
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
is not something that they can hang on
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
to think about an administrative cost of
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
of a processing applications is one of
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
the most fundamental functions of being
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
a property manager
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's no different than collecting the
 
01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.310 align:start position:0%
it's no different than collecting the
rent

01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
rent
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
posting the rent in the in the tenant
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
ledger advertising for vacancies or
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
doing payroll there are all things that
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
are just inherent in the job of managing
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
rental property
 
01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.070 align:start position:0%
rental property
and

01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think a tenant should be imposed
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
a separate charge for each one of those
 
01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:04.310 align:start position:0%
a separate charge for each one of those
um

01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
when there are
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 applicants or more for every
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
given vacancy
 
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of an application fee that is
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
over and above
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of the the out-of-pocket cost
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
for the landlord is just pure gravy
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
and these never get refunded never
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
having said all that i do think there
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
are some improvements in the bill that i
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind i'd like to run
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
through that i think could make it a
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
little bit better for
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
all inval or
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
actually for landlords truthfully
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
um if you were to take a a look at line
 
01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.990 align:start position:0%
um if you were to take a a look at line
15

01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
where it says within 15 days of
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
submission of the application by
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
prospective tenant uh a landlord that
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
requires an application an application
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
fee shell
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
i think because i've been told by
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
landlords um
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i certainly believe them that
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes getting the the uh
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
return on the criminal record check
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
is takes longer than 15 days that i
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
think probably you need if you care if
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
you were to pass the bill you'd want to
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
extend that to 30 days
 
01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.510 align:start position:0%
extend that to 30 days
um

01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise there'll be times when
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
landlords can't comply
 
01:43:19.119 --> 01:43:20.229 align:start position:0%
landlords can't comply
um

01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:20.239 --> 01:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
the second thing is on line 17 and this
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
is really a simple thing
 
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.189 align:start position:0%
is really a simple thing
um

01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
17 and sub paragraph a says
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
inform an applicant
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh in writing
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
that they've been the applicant's been
 
01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:38.790 align:start position:0%
that they've been the applicant's been
denied

01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh it probably ought to say inform an
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
applicant who has been denied that
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
they've been denied otherwise you'd have
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
to take the people who are accepted and
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
tell them they've been
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
again it's a silly thing it's just a
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
minor drafting problem
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
i would also
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
recommend that if
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
the landlord pre-discloses
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
that they're going to charge 35
 
01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.470 align:start position:0%
that they're going to charge 35
for for

01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
for for
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
he has an out-of-pocket cost of 35
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
for a uh
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
criminal record check or x dollars for
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
credit check if he discloses those up
 
01:44:16.719 --> 01:44:17.830 align:start position:0%
credit check if he discloses those up
front

01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
front
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
and he
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
and that's all he charges that he
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to send any information
 
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
back to the tenant to the applicant
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
afterwards that everything he's charged
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
up front is a disclosed out-of-pocket
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
cost and there's no need to get back to
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
the landlord about that or to the
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
applicant about it and then my final
 
01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:38.950 align:start position:0%
applicant about it and then my final
change

01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
which may surprise some people i do
 
01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
think that the remedy
 
01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:45.109 align:start position:0%
think that the remedy
358-a

01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
358-a
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's our unfair and deceptive trade
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
practice the statute
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's a minimum one thousand dollar
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
penalty and i honestly think that under
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that's a tad high and
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
i would cut it instead of referring to
 
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.910 align:start position:0%
i would cut it instead of referring to
358a

01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
358a
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
i would simply make it a 500 penalty
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
and and largely
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
as a deterrent i'm not saying that
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
everybody suffers a 500 injury but if
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
you don't make it significant there's
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know and no one's policing this
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
stuff so you
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know you want to make some
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
significant deterrent and
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say and i'd be
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
questions for attorney barry
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan um
 
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
yes i am i'm glad that's glad to see
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
your proposed changing uh that 540 810
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
part that seemed
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
also the how unusual is it under current
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
practice to mail a
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
of survey rejection letter to to uh to
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
applicants i haven't had to
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
i have been on both sides of it but i
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
haven't had to uh rent it place out to
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
anybody or seek a rental apartment
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
myself since the last millennium so i've
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
been fortunate so i may be
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
behind the times but i don't remember
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
ever getting
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
or sending a letter to a potential
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
tenant usually well yeah the letter i
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
mean i don't think it's common practice
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
now but the issue if
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
any tenant fills out an application then
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
obviously they fill out where
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
where they are they give an address so
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
that if they are accepted they can be
 
01:46:18.719 --> 01:46:21.590 align:start position:0%
that if they are accepted they can be
contacted

01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
other questions for attorney barry
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm more than willing to work with
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh i i know that dave and nick are here
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
and i i'm more than willing to work with
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
people on some kind of compromise but i
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
just think that in the environment that
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're living in
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple fees
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
to try to find a single apartment
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
imposed on often the poorest people
 
01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
imposed on often the poorest people
around

01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
is just something we need to deal with
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
if i could just inquire is there
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
is there any limit on
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
the amount that a landlord could charge
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
for an application not a limit at all
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry representative langley you
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%

01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
hud pays for these uh for section 8
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
applicants they do not they also have to
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
raise their own uh hud doesn't pay for
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative lorenzo has a
 
01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:24.310 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative lorenzo has a
question

01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr claire and thank you for
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
telling my question uh attorney barry so
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
in some
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
suggested changes to this bill
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
an upfront
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
notice to the applicant that you're
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
going to charge fees right
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah let me try to be clear my concept
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
is and i haven't written this down my
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
concept is if all you're charging is the
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket expenses say of a credit
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
check and a uh um
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
if that's all you're charging you
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
disclose that up front and then you
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to send them anything about
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
why you're not returned
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's the idea i'm tossing around
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
just to follow up please
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
as far as the penalties
 
01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:23.910 align:start position:0%
as far as the penalties
um

01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
all right let's just talk about the
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:30.629 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
said this about a 15 to 30 day
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.639 --> 01:48:46.629 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
there'll be there would be a penalty if
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
the landlord does not send back the
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
fees in time in a timely manner
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
i almost think of this as being similar
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
to a security deposit law you know and
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
that and what we
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
the things that we do to return folks
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
security deposit
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's a time frame um
 
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.750 align:start position:0%
there's a time frame um
and

01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.350 align:start position:0%
and
the

01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
list of what was spent should be
 
01:49:14.639 --> 01:49:16.470 align:start position:0%
list of what was spent should be
itemized

01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
itemized
 
01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.910 align:start position:0%
itemized
and

01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
i was thinking in terms of maybe triple
 
01:49:20.159 --> 01:49:21.750 align:start position:0%
i was thinking in terms of maybe triple
damages

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
damages
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
landlord does not return the deposit to
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
the tenant rather than say a flat 500
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'll be grateful for what any whatever
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
you folks are willing to impose as a
 
01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
penalty i do
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
i do agree with you for sure that it is
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
very akin to the process
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh about security uh the handling of
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
security deposits
 
01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:51.189 align:start position:0%
security deposits
um

01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
the amount i think has to be enough to
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
motivate people to comply with uh to
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
comply with the law
 
01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.550 align:start position:0%
comply with the law
and

01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
i'll happy to leave that to
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
sorry i just have one more thank you mr
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
cheers i thank you
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
journey barry for taking my question no
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
um me we as we're reading through this
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me that peop many of these
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
people are homeless or eventually will
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
become homeless
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
what type of notification would you see
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
as appropriate for that population and
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
how would you facilitate yeah i think
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
the burden would have to be on the
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
applicant remember when they come right
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry when the applicant
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
makes their app come to the office makes
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
the application
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to put an address
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
down i mean the landlords here will tell
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
me otherwise but i've never seen an
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
application that doesn't have an address
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
if the person is homeless presumably
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
they will either have a po a po box
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
a homeless shelter as an address or the
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
address of a relative where they're
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
where they are regularly uh uh getting
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
their mail i think that's but not be on
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
the landlord to figure it out it's what
 
01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:17.830 align:start position:0%
the landlord to figure it out it's what
whatever

01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
the tenant puts down on the on the
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
address line of the application that's
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
where the landlord would have to send
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
whatever he's obligated to send under
 
01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
whatever he's obligated to send under
the

01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
have one more question i think and that
 
01:51:35.599 --> 01:51:36.629 align:start position:0%
have one more question i think and that
and

01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
i can see it being a huge pain in the
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
neck for a landlord to try to calculate
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
the expenses
 
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.270 align:start position:0%
the expenses
and

01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:50.950 align:start position:0%
and
then

01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of the deposit and sending a
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
letter to it to explain and
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if there would be
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
some benefit to setting
 
01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:02.629 align:start position:0%
some benefit to setting
a

01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
a standard amount
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
for example fifty dollars
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
that that landlords could charge for an
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
application fee
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
if but they could charge more than fifty
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
dollars but if they did then they'd have
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
to go through this rigmarole but if a
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
standard for you fifty dollars they
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do that
 
01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.109 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to do that
is

01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah uh up you know it's funny i've
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
i've thought about this a lot and i
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
think that that probably a
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's certainly worth thinking about my
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
my issue is this there are a number of
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
landlords right now who don't
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
who don't uh charge applications
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
and once you establish the maximum
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
it often becomes
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
what everybody does
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh but notwithstanding that reservation
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly willing
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
to work with anyone who wants to work on
 
01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:58.550 align:start position:0%
to work with anyone who wants to work on
it

01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
thanks for your testimony thank you
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo and so we're
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
deposits being universal perhaps
 
01:53:15.679 --> 01:53:16.950 align:start position:0%
deposits being universal perhaps
so

01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
can a landlord get in trouble if they
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
charge a deposit
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
sure if if
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
discrepancy is based on
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
the protected classes of the state and
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
federal housing discrimination laws then
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
they can get in trouble otherwise it's
 
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
i think you're off the hook
 
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
yes represent opera uh i thank you mr
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%

very quickly are you going to submit
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
your suggestions for improvement in
 
01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
your suggestions for improvement in
writing

01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
writing
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
i would be very happy to do that i would

01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%

01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
so i wanna tell you what my experience
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
is as a landlord
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
of several decades
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
and 48 units and talking with the
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
landlords across the state
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
constantly on different landlord tenant
 
01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.510 align:start position:0%
constantly on different landlord tenant
issues

01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
what's been portrayed here
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying it doesn't happen
 
01:55:07.679 --> 01:55:08.629 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying it doesn't happen
but

01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
i would say that it must be a very small
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
percentage of the landlords that are
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of that
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
the situation of charging extra
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
fees in my company what we do is we
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
charge 35 dollars for the application
 
01:55:22.639 --> 01:55:23.589 align:start position:0%
charge 35 dollars for the application
fee

01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
fee
 
01:55:23.599 --> 01:55:24.629 align:start position:0%
fee
which

01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:55:24.639 --> 01:55:25.750 align:start position:0%
which
covers

01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
covers
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
of our credit landlord tenant criminal
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
not quite a criminal report
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
which is in the neighborhood of 27
 
01:55:36.639 --> 01:55:38.390 align:start position:0%
which is in the neighborhood of 27
plus

01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
plus
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
an annual fee
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
so it's a little hard to predict what
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
the actual cost is
 
01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
first off
 
01:55:47.350 --> 01:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
in my company
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
when we see
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
multiple people applying first of all
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's not hundreds of people applying
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's not 10 people applying
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
we show an apartment and we might
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
show it
 
01:56:02.159 --> 01:56:02.950 align:start position:0%
show it
uh

01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
four or five or six times in an
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon because it is
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
truly um a difficult market with that
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
little available so there's a fair
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
amount of showings
 
01:56:16.229 --> 01:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
of those maybe two or three people don't
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
even show up so it's wasted my time to
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
and of those maybe i get two
 
01:56:24.719 --> 01:56:27.030 align:start position:0%
and of those maybe i get two
applications

01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's what i really see
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
one to two or three maybe three
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
but often two in this market
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
applications so it's not like what
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
you've been portrayed
 
01:56:39.679 --> 01:56:41.830 align:start position:0%
you've been portrayed
um

01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
what we do is we tell the people look i
 
01:56:46.229 --> 01:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
know you're probably applying to many
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
places so
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
we will process everything that we can
 
01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.350 align:start position:0%
we will process everything that we can
do

01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't charge
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
a land a
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
credit report landlord tenant report and
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
and then when it comes down to it
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
if one application is clearly stronger
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
than another on what we can do by phone
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
calls to landlord references and
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
employment and so forth then we'll be
 
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
going with that application and charging
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
that fee and requesting the report but
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
we won't be charging
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
yours because it's not going to be as
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
strong so
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
you may get all of your money back
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
but if if we get to a situation where we
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
can't make a determination on that then
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
we have to get both
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant credit reports
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
and we will have to process that and
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
they sign a form up front that says we
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
understand that the application fee
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
portion of this money is non-refundable
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
and in our company is 35
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
by the way you might have noticed that
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
david klein and i and elliot were
 
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
talking prior to the hearing we're very
 
01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
willing to sit down with elliot which
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
we've done many times over the years and
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
work on something that would be a
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
a good
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
mutual ground
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
on this and i can recognize that what
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're speaking of the first person
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
could be happening
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
it could easily be happening so it's
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
probably something that needs to be
 
01:58:10.719 --> 01:58:12.229 align:start position:0%
probably something that needs to be
addressed

01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
there's three things that are being
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
confused here
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
so let's get clear on terms
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
there's an application fee
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
there's a security deposit
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
which is completely separate
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
and there's earnest money
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
so what this bill is about is
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
application fees
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm hearing people talk about
 
01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.589 align:start position:0%
and i'm hearing people talk about
security

01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
security
 
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
but that's not what this bill is about
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
and it's not about earnest money either
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
in a contract situation earnest money is
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
money you put down
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
that secures the contract and proves
 
01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:48.470 align:start position:0%
that secures the contract and proves
that

01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know you're uh
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
you're earnest in putting the deal
 
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.950 align:start position:0%
you're earnest in putting the deal
together

01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
and you would lose that if you were to
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
back out
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
but if you were not accepted you get all
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
of that back in total
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
so um be careful as we're drafting this
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
our experience in my experience and
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
talking to many many landlords is that
 
01:59:14.070 --> 01:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
very large number of tenants that come
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
and apply that are falsifying their
 
01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:22.390 align:start position:0%
and apply that are falsifying their
applications

01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
it happens
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
every time i put a market
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
an apartment on the market
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
every single time
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
well occasionally i get a great
 
01:59:35.189 --> 01:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
applicant first off
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
but um most often they're lying about
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
their landlord references
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
and that's something we take a lot of
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
time and effort to figure out who is the
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
true landlord
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
i could tell you so many stories of
 
01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
people that have falsified landlord
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
references and then because of the
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
time and effort that we put into this
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
and all the screening and the reports
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we get back we find out who the
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
true landlord is
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
and it turns out of course that that was
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
a bad reference or we never get to speak
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the true landlord because
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
we just can't find it
 
02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.070 align:start position:0%
we just can't find it
so

02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
what this bill says
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
is all those people that are falsifying
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
their landlord references
 
02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:16.229 align:start position:0%
their landlord references
falsifying

02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
falsifying
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
their application in different ways or
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
are falsifying their eviction records
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
and we spend a lot of time and effort to
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
figure that out those people get their
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
so we definitely need to change the
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
and again we're happy to work with
 
02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:40.709 align:start position:0%
and again we're happy to work with
elliot

02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
elliot
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
and i think you've seen us over the
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
years come through with win-win
 
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.229 align:start position:0%
years come through with win-win
situations

02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
situations
 
02:00:46.239 --> 02:00:48.629 align:start position:0%
situations
um

02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
i've got written testimony excuse me can
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
can you get it
 
02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.510 align:start position:0%
can you get it
okay

02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
um i just quickly see if i've covered
 
02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
um i just quickly see if i've covered
everything

02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.270 align:start position:0%
everything
so

02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know if the bill was passed as it's
 
02:01:09.199 --> 02:01:12.310 align:start position:0%
you know if the bill was passed as it's
written

02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
it has some detrimental effects to the
 
02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:17.430 align:start position:0%
it has some detrimental effects to the
applicants

02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.719 --> 02:01:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:24.239 --> 02:01:25.030 align:start position:0%
that
if

02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:25.830 align:start position:0%
if
uh

02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
landlords are not going to be reimbursed
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
for time and effort
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to simplify their process
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
rather than do what i'm doing they're
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
going to say well okay i'll just get my
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
credit reports on every single person
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that's going to give me an instant
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
like number and a thing to look at and
 
02:01:40.239 --> 02:01:40.950 align:start position:0%
like number and a thing to look at and
say

02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
i can read them out there that that's
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
quicker and then other tenants all the
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
tenants are being charged
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
so i there's probably more in here
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
please read through the points
 
02:01:59.830 --> 02:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm really happy to take questions
 
02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
um i'm really happy to take questions
and

02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
hope that that you will be asking me
 
02:02:04.239 --> 02:02:06.470 align:start position:0%
hope that that you will be asking me
questions

02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions for mr norman
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
norman for taking my question i just
 
02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to set the record straight when i
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned the security deposit process
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
as a way to
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
return the um apartment deposits
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's all i meant i wasn't mixing
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
apples with oranges there so i just
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know that thank you i
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
understand but but there were times when
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
people were talking about security but
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
they were referring to application piece
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative langley did you have a
 
02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:49.189 align:start position:0%
representative langley did you have a
question

02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
norman for taking my question
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you made reference to
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
having checked and validated people's
 
02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:59.109 align:start position:0%
having checked and validated people's
references

02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
references
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
is there any recourse for example if you
 
02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:03.030 align:start position:0%
is there any recourse for example if you
got

02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
references that lied if for example i
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
gave you you know i'm renting trying to
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
rent an apartment from you and i give
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative judy lorenzo as my
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
former landlord and there was no
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
connection there whatsoever do you have
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
any uh recourse in this in your lease
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
respond to that tenant or to make some
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
changes in the rental agreements or
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent excellent question i
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
would love to see something in the final
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
bill about tenants falsifying
 
02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:36.310 align:start position:0%
bill about tenants falsifying
applications

02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
applications
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
there is no recourse there is no remedy
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the landlord there's no
 
02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.430 align:start position:0%
for the landlord there's no
reimbursement

02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
of that there's no criminal charges
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that happens to a tenant
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
when they're falsifying landlord
 
02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:48.709 align:start position:0%
when they're falsifying landlord
references

02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
references
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
in my experience maybe
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
we get three
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
in the span of renting an apartment
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
usually what happens is
 
02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
the people that are falsifying they're
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
desperate to get something they're there
 
02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:05.510 align:start position:0%
desperate to get something they're there
first

02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
so i have to weed through all of the
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
time and effort of falsified
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
applications before i get to the good
 
02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:12.950 align:start position:0%
applications before i get to the good
one

02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
i had a tenant that told me oh i don't
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
have any landlord references because
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
i my most recent place was
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
an older lady and she passed away
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
and before that i was with family
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
and her name was mary but you won't be
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
able to speak to her she passed away
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
guess who i spoke to
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
i spoke to mary
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
i found mary she didn't sound dead to me
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
and it was a bad reference
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
it just happens all the time just this
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago i had
 
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
two two out of three that falsified
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
landlord references i called
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
for the the
 
02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:54.149 align:start position:0%
for the the
landlord

02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
they didn't quite know the property
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's not reasonable
 
02:05:01.119 --> 02:05:02.229 align:start position:0%
that's not reasonable
um

02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
like when did you buy it oh a year or
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
two ago no the tax record says it was
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
like 17 years ago who's the owner oh i
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
manage it first he was the owner then
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
he's the manager
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
then he gave then he called back a day
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
or two later and said i found the owner
 
02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
i called that person they weren't the
 
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:18.830 align:start position:0%
i called that person they weren't the
owner

02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
owner
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%

and

02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
specifically our manchester work group
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
called the manchester housing alliance
 
02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
we are resident uh we are a group of
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
manchester residents who want safe
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
affordable homes for everybody in the
 
02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:18.149 align:start position:0%
affordable homes for everybody in the
city

02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
city
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
i want to start off by saying
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
i work with a lot of tenants i go door
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
to door
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
i knock doors ask people about their
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
landlords about you know their process
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
in finding apartments what the process
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
should look like
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
um and also help tenants through some of
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
the problems they have with their
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
landlords um i definitely want to say
 
02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
that out of all the tenants i've talked
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
to um i haven't found any of nics that
 
02:06:42.629 --> 02:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
have had any nic normans that have had
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
any complaints from what it seems he
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
seems to be like a pretty reputable
 
02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.149 align:start position:0%
seems to be like a pretty reputable
landlord

02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
and really the intent of this bill is to
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
stop i think bad behavior from landlords
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
who aren't as reputable as him
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
and just like representative sylvia uh
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
said um is it sorry did i get your name
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
right representative okay um
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
just as he said you know we shouldn't
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
demonize all landlords
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i want to just push back a little
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
bit and say that we shouldn't be
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
demonizing all tenants either you know
 
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
there are bad faith actors on both sides
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
there are tenants who will lie on their
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
application fees and there are landlords
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
who are going to collect access fees um
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
i think this bill be a great way to
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
counter those two things out and as um
 
02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.109 align:start position:0%
counter those two things out and as um
sorry

02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
and as elliott berry said
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
administrative fees are part of the job
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i want to look at the totality of
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
what landlording really is
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
and we as the tenant
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
will pay the landlord rent every single
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
month the landlord hopefully gets a
 
02:07:45.679 --> 02:07:46.629 align:start position:0%
month the landlord hopefully gets a
profit

02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
profit
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
and they also build equity of the
 
02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.030 align:start position:0%
and they also build equity of the
buildings

02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
the tenant gets a place to stay which is
 
02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
great but i think the fact that profit
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
is built into it i think that
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
a reasonable fee for
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
an application is just part of the
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
my biggest regret is i couldn't bring a
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
tenant with me who has had to
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
apply to at least a dozen properties um
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
there was a woman before this committee
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday bree whalen
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
who struggles to find a landlord who can
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
find section 8 or who would take her
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
section 8 voucher
 
02:08:28.639 --> 02:08:29.510 align:start position:0%
section 8 voucher
and

02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
she pays surprisingly more money for
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
these low-income houses for an
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
application fee than i do for the luxury
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
apartments that i apply for
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
generally i find that i pay about 25 to
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
35 dollars
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
per application fee for an apartment
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
that i can rent um i'm very fortunate
 
02:08:48.870 --> 02:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
right now i'm doing pretty well right
 
02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:49.589 align:start position:0%
right now i'm doing pretty well right
now

02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:49.599 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
so i generally rent
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
higher end apartments
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm really surprised to find that lower
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
income tenants are paying higher fees
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
than what i'm paying
 
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
and they are less able to actually pay
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
those fees
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
if i could wave a magic wand in reverse
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
situation i would
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
but you know when you have an apartment
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
where 10 20 30 people are applying
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
and i presume a good portion of them are
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
paying an application fee at the very
 
02:09:17.679 --> 02:09:18.950 align:start position:0%
paying an application fee at the very
least

02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
least
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then they get denied and then those
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
20 30 people have to keep on applying to
 
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes over a dozen
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
apartments i mean
 
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
do the math there
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
so i really want to
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
have us think here you know the landlord
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
is profiting off of this which is fine
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know hey it's a free market economy
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
um gotta i love america for that um but
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
the tenant is having a tough time being
 
02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
able to find an apartment and when you
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
multiply how many apartments that that
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
low income tenant has to apply to
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
it becomes cost prohibitive um i know
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
specifically that woman she's had to
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
choose between doing laundry and
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
applying for an apartment because it was
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
about the same cost and you don't want
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
to show up for an apartment tour you
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
know wearing stinky clothes not a good
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
way to make a good impression
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
um so yeah i would highly encourage ben
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
frost and nick norman
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
to uh sorry about ben frost elliott
 
02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
berry and nick norman to work together
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
on this bill and i really hope that we
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
can get this passed
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
and sorry if i went a little long there
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
i will gladly take your questions
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr claire and
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr lemay um
 
02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
just have an observation and that is
 
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
that with market apartments um when they
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
have vacancies they negotiate on you
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
know what the fees are going to be um
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
they have move-in specials and you know
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a whole slate of things that
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
they do
 
02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
they do
um

02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
at the lower end of the scale
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
folks don't have that luxury lane lights
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't have that luxury to be able to do
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
that and that's why
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
you pay less when you're looking for a
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
market unit than
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
a tenant looking for moderate or low
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
income housing or loan you know
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
affordable apartments would pay more
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
than what you pay
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
oh i really appreciate the context thank
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%

02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%

last last pink card i have is from david
 
02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:32.390 align:start position:0%
last last pink card i have is from david
klein

02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to speak my
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
name is david klein i am a landlord on
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:43.830 align:start position:0%

attorney

02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.430 align:start position:0%
attorney
um

02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
because of the question asked by
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan about not having
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
application fees i want to point out
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
that the application fees have a couple
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
of different purposes
 
02:11:56.069 --> 02:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
one of which right off the bat is to
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
screen out people who are not serious
 
02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:58.870 align:start position:0%
screen out people who are not serious
about

02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
renting the apartment but are just going
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
to submit if it's free an application
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
and that will really if we had 100
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
applications for one apartment it's
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to bog down the process trying to
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
screen out who's serious and who's not
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
never mind the good and the bad people
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
the other other obvious is the one that
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
we talked about it offsets some of the
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
real costs we as landlords are occurring
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the credit reports the background
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
checks which even the drafters of the
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
bills recognize are real costs and
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
something we should be reimbursed for
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
and yes tenants lie on these
 
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
applications all the time i've had
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
people write down jobs that they don't
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things of that nature i
 
02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
even had one woman who used somebody
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
else's social security number and name
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
totally fraudulent in her application
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
at this point in my life because when i
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
hit 70 i had to back off from being
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
fully involved we have hired a
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
management company they're charging a
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
whopping big forty nine dollar
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
application fee of that a minimum of
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
twenty five dollars is for the out of
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
pocket costs they're only charging
 
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
twenty four dollars for
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
their time the various overheads
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
the problem and if you listen to nick
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
he's charging 35 it's costing him 37 so
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
he's getting about 8 bucks
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
and if you look at this bill
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
particularly line 24 and something that
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
even elliot has conceded is overly
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
burdensome they're bringing in the
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
drafters of the bill the consumer
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
protection statute rsa 350 358-a
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
this has a one thousand dollar minimum
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
damage clause plus attorney's fees
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
so that for the eight dollars if nick is
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
late getting this letter out in the 15
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
days he's subject to a thousand dollar
 
02:13:50.639 --> 02:13:51.589 align:start position:0%
days he's subject to a thousand dollar
fine

02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
now this is a civil penalty it's
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
actually worse
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
than if you've missed getting out a
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
security deposit which is just double
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
damages and it's a lot more money for
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
the tenant it's even more onerous i
 
02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:04.629 align:start position:0%
the tenant it's even more onerous i
believe

02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:14:04.639 --> 02:14:05.430 align:start position:0%
believe
than

02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
if you can somebody would shoplifted and
 
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
committed a class b misdemeanor
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy very happy to hear that
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
elliot agreed that this is an overly
 
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
burdensome one
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
second of all it's the wording is shall
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
be imposed it doesn't give the judge any
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
leeway in the event
 
02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
someone's sick because of covid
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
or other
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
other things that you relate getting
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
into the post office
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
so we my objections to the bill is not
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
the concept of trying to limit down
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
these fees and i'm perfectly happy to
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
work with elia my objection is the
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
penalties are so severe
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
that that really the bill is hostile
 
02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:45.669 align:start position:0%
that that really the bill is hostile
um

02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
and as i said you know contrast is the
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
security the security deposit law if you
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
fail to get it back to the tenant it
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
simply double damages no attorneys fees
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
nothing else
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
and you're still allowed to deduct your
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
costs your actual unpaid rent damages to
 
02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
the apartment in the security deposit
 
02:15:02.159 --> 02:15:06.470 align:start position:0%
the apartment in the security deposit
law

02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
the procedure also in this particular
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
bill everything's by mail
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i have a
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
problem with that elliot actually
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
addressed and i agree with him 100
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
is that if you take only your costs
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
that seven and a half dollar fee that
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
nick was talking about the twenty five
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
dollar fee by management companies
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
charges up front disclose it
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
why do we have to go out and mail a
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
letter why can't we just email
 
02:15:32.079 --> 02:15:33.510 align:start position:0%
letter why can't we just email
text

02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
text
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
the tenant they've been denied
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
this bill puts an unduly burden on us
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
and part of the problem from my
 
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
perspective is what if the tenant says i
 
02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
never got it how do i prove i mail a
 
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
letter well there's only two ways you go
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
to go to the post office and get a
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
certificate of mailing or you go to the
 
02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
post office
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
and send the letter out certified mail
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
email we have proof because you have it
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
on the email server and the same with
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
texting on your phone
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
so that this puts a burden on landlords
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
to do extra work where you're not
 
02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
allowing them to even charge for their
 
02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:08.149 align:start position:0%
allowing them to even charge for their
time

02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
this should be an easy procedure
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
and this is where again ellie and i
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
agree if you take only your costs that's
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
disclosed up front the tenant knows that
 
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get anything back
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
because you took that 27
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
then it should be just a quick easy
 
02:16:23.199 --> 02:16:24.390 align:start position:0%
then it should be just a quick easy
denial

02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
denial
 
02:16:26.709 --> 02:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
via email or something that that don't
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
have to send someone to the post office
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
and if you think about any time you've
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
gone to the post office by the time you
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
drive there drive back and get through
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
your transaction you've got another hour
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
in minimum never mind the cost of the
 
02:16:37.599 --> 02:16:46.230 align:start position:0%
in minimum never mind the cost of the
mailing

02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:47.599 align:start position:0%
another problem with the way this bill
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
is structured is because the fees the
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
penalties are so great
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
you're giving the unscrupulous tenant
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
or applicant the opportunity to go up
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
and claim i didn't get it and file suit
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
and hire an attorney after all the
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
landlord's going to be paying the
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees all he's going to do is
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
hit once or twice for a 50 fee
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
and he's ahead of the game for about a
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:17:09.509 --> 02:17:09.519 align:start position:0%
we don't want to incentivize people to
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
commit fraud we don't want to clog the
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
courts with these cases this is a small
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
claim dollar amount should stay in small
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
claims should not have attorneys
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why i
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
want to work with la bring this bill
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
down to something
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and making sense could
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
be simply that the attorney the
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
landlords can get their actual
 
02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket costs and maybe something
 
02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
like three times minimum wage the state
 
02:17:36.629 --> 02:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
minimum wage for their time at seven
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
fifty seven twenty five an hour you're
 
02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
talking about twenty one twenty two
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
dollars so it's not a whole lot of money
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why i said that is
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
if you want to make it
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
a maximum fee we need to index it to
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
inflation somehow
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
because you know right now
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
we all know what's going on in the
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
inflation world and we don't know where
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's going and how long it will be and i
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't think we want to come back and we
 
02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:02.709 align:start position:0%
don't think we want to come back and we
lit

02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
lit
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
not relitigate but re re-argue this bill
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
and try and transform it so that's one
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
of my ideas what to do with it
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things i do want you to think
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
about as the bill is written this bill
 
02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
is actually very hostile to landlords
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
with the penalties exceedingly hostile
 
02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
one of the problems that we're having in
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
is we have a very severe shortage of
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
housing that's why we're here why things
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
like this are happening
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
we don't want to enact legislation
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's host makes it a more hostile
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
environment for landlords to develop and
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
add to that supply so we've got to tone
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
this bill down
 
02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
and make it better make it realistic
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
and if you're hearing from nick and i
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
as the landlords we're not objecting to
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
trying to make something reasonable and
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
not and get rid of the abuse that's been
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
put in what we're trying to do is make
 
02:18:54.549 --> 02:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
it so it's palatable to us
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you catch the bad landlord maybe we
 
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
use a fine like um elliot had suggested
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
but not not this thing this is this this
 
02:19:05.429 --> 02:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
in its current form is just terrible
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
and let us
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
give us a chance to work together maybe
 
02:19:10.469 --> 02:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
you have put this out to a sub-committee
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
to work with us as another alternative
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
but this bill as written is just too
 
02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:17.910 align:start position:0%
but this bill as written is just too
hard

02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
hard
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
four landlords and two in it's an
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
incredibly cumbersome procedure
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
and it will only push costs up and that
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
we don't need because it's gonna
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
eventually get worked back into rents
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
i appreciate everyone's time listening
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
to me and certainly mr chairman i'm open
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
to questions
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thank you mr chairman and
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr klein for your testimony
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
and i have to agree with you
 
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
that we want this process to be simple
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
and not honorous um and clear
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
so i do hope that you do have the chance
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
to work together on this and if you want
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
to like loop in or you have any
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions for me as a former landlord i
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
would certainly be happy to
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
assist i appreciate that thank you very
 
02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:10.309 align:start position:0%
assist i appreciate that thank you very
much

02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing none i will note that i
 
02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:19.429 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing none i will note that i
anticipate

02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
an executive session on this bill two
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
weeks from today so that would be your
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who'd like to
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the hearing on
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
our next hearing is on house bill 1603
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
defining certain school information as
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
governmental records under the right to
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
we'll call upon the prime sponsor
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative yokela to provide his
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
is to clarify
 
02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:52.550 align:start position:0%
is to clarify
that

02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that
 
02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:57.270 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that
schools

02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
are that schools are covered by 91a and
 
02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:03.590 align:start position:0%
are that schools are covered by 91a and
that

02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
that they
 
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:06.830 align:start position:0%
need to
um

02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
provide the records when requested i've
 
02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
heard that from from um
 
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
people that have been requesting records
 
02:22:19.429 --> 02:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
of the schools have been um
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
not been given this given information
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
and so i asked
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
a number of reps
 
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
of the co-sponsors especially
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
what things that they have seen in their
 
02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:33.670 align:start position:0%
what things that they have seen in their
um

02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
time either or or or
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
have been expressed to them from their
 
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
constituents that they see that
 
02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:42.550 align:start position:0%
constituents that they see that
the

02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
towns are not
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
maybe reluctant to or are
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
not really clear that they are covered
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
under 91a
 
02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
under 91a
and

02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
and
so

02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
after

02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
drafting the bill
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
i got a call from
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
the right to know
 
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire people
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
about how they
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're not a super big fan of
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
even though that this list
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
um doesn't limit anything it's actually
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
things that are already covered
 
02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's just clarifying it by saying you
 
02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:21.670 align:start position:0%
it's just clarifying it by saying you
know

02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
need to be retained
 
02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
and they
 
02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
this list is
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
includes but is not limited to the
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
things on this list so it's not actually
 
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
limiting anything it's just clarifying
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
it for
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
the administrators to be able to
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
more clearly um
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
realize the type types of things that
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:52.230 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
and
so

02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
um right to know new hampshire thought
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
that there would there was a better
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
place to put
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
this list for clarifying to schools and
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment that i just
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
um passed around
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
and it puts it in um
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
the school reports and and retention of
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
records of schools
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
instead of directly in 91a and it just
 
02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:17.429 align:start position:0%
instead of directly in 91a and it just
says

02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
essentially the same language that was
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
originally in the bill but it's just
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
putting it at a different section and
 
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
saying hey if you need to
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
you need to have a policy
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
and and keep these public records um
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
um to be in compliance with 91a
 
02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:35.990 align:start position:0%
um to be in compliance with 91a
so

02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
um it's just putting it in a different
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
section of law so that that um
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
that 91a is not
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
overly verbose
 
02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:45.429 align:start position:0%
overly verbose
because

02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
a problem with it be being um you know a
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
giant list in 91a so i agreed and
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
drafted this amendment thank you
 
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen the amendment
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
over um

02:25:34.469 --> 02:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
so as as i understand the your testimony
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
the the things that were listed at least
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
listed in your
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
in the bill it's essentially the ex
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
it is the exact same list
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's just put in a different section of
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
law right but i guess my question is uh
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony
 
02:25:56.720 --> 02:25:57.990 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony
uh

02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
and your reference to right to know
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
that these things are already covered
 
02:26:05.429 --> 02:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
under right to know
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
you're just
 
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
expounding on them or making them more
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
specific right right because um a lot of
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
the people that fill the re the right to
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
know requests are not actually lawyers
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know they're not going to send all
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
of the documents for the entire school
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
to the lawyer to decide what is and what
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
covered they're going to be doing that
 
02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
filtering mostly on their own and then
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
if they get caught not giving something
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
then they will go the lawyer and say you
 
02:26:31.439 --> 02:26:32.230 align:start position:0%
then they will go the lawyer and say you
know

02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
after the fact so this will help you
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
know the layperson understand what is um
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
covered under the right to know and so
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
this is putting it in kind of the school
 
02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:43.910 align:start position:0%
this is putting it in kind of the school
reports

02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
reports
 
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
section of law so that they
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
um will
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
will uh so because it's covering school
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
so it makes more sense to put that in
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
there so thank you
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any concern that
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
by listing it this way it might be to
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
some extent limiting
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of what people might think is
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:14.950 align:start position:0%
well
i

02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
in my testimony at the beginning i
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that the
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
um the statement you know the public
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
record shall be retained for compliance
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
with 91a includes but is not limited to
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know is
 
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
is as clear as i can get it
 
02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%

02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:43.670 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you for your thank you
today

02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.630 --> 02:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
good morning again margaret burns with
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
um we're here in opposition to
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 1603 in major part
 
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
for the same testimony that i provided
 
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
on a different bill this morning so rsa
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
91a 1a paragraph 3 already defines very
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
broadly what is a governmental record
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
and basically any record that exists in
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
an ascertainable format whether it's
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
written whether it's recorded
 
02:28:32.309 --> 02:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
almost everything falls under the
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
definition of a governmental record so
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
adding a list of just a few very
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
specific types of school records to the
 
02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
definition statute is simply not
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
necessary to make them governmental
 
02:28:47.830 --> 02:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
records they already are governmental
 
02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
records and certainly the reason for the
 
02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
broad definition is so that we don't
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
need an endlessly amended long list in
 
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
the statute of what qualifies as a
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
governmental record that would be
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
inefficient and in some ways would
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
undermine having a very broad definition
 
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
of a governmental record
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
i'm just of course seeing the amendment
 
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
that was presented for the very first
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
time if the bill would be amended to
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
simply deal with the retention of
 
02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
certain records in the school statutes
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
then nhma would simply have no position
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
on the bill if it were just to deal with
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
retention of records under a school
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
statute if if that's what the amendment
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
does so that concludes my testimony i'm
 
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:36.800 align:start position:0%

02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1603 for the reasons that i
 
02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
stated on the bill earlier this morning
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%

the amendment in a second um the uh but
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced i'm on page one
 
02:30:57.270 --> 02:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
lines 19
 
02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
through 22 there's some student
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
information in there that they're saying
 
02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
are public records so long as the
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
student information is redacted
 
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
specifically paragraph six out of
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
district placement information with
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
redaction of student identifying
 
02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:12.630 align:start position:0%

02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
i want to know what they what this would
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
mean by information um if it's you know
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
money or a bill perhaps i mean that
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's likely going to be a public
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
record we have to be mindful though that
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
if a student um is receiving special
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
education services and has to be put
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
placed in an out of district placement
 
02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
either because the child is medically
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
medically fragile
 
02:31:35.830 --> 02:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
has perhaps mental or behavioral issues
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
in a very small school district
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
people are going to know who that child
 
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
is it's going to be identifiable
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not the
 
02:31:46.790 --> 02:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
student's name is on those records
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
pair line 21 paragraph 7 complaints and
 
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
responses to complaints with redaction
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
of student identifying information
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
nhsba is going to take the position that
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
that complaint is a student record
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
is defined under the family educational
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
privacy rights act federal law ferpa you
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
may be familiar with that that
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
the federal law prohibits disclosure of
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
student records absent parental consent
 
02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
so a state statute cannot dictate that a
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
a a complaint from a parent to a school
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
district even if the information is
 
02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
redacted it would still be covered under
 
02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
ferp would be a would be a
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
student record which federal law
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
prohibits disclosure of
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment
 
02:32:35.349 --> 02:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
indeed there is no corresponding records
 
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
retention statute for school districts
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
the way there is for municipalities
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
under rsa 33-a colon 3a
 
02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
for nhsba we have often borrowed from
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
that records retention schedule just to
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
you know to the extent that it may or
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
may not be applicable or to the extent
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
that one of the records in that rsa 33-8
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
colon 3 um is
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
if there's a corresponding record in the
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
possession of a school district we
 
02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
borrow from it um
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of records retention
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's a complicated story behind this
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
i will try to spare you the time
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
about 15 years ago the department of
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
education had a records retention
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
schedule publicly posted on their
 
02:33:23.270 --> 02:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
website nhsba would keep a copy of that
 
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
we would include it as an attachment to
 
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
one of our sample policies so when we
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
would get an inquiry from a school
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
usually the superintendent as to how
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
long a particular document would have to
 
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
be retained we could point to that and
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
say this is an nhs this is a new
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of education
 
02:33:38.479 --> 02:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of education
document

02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
the doe redid their website
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
10 12 years ago and that document was
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
removed publicly from from public access
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
on the website at that time i called the
 
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
department of education i said is it no
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
longer on the website because you redid
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
the website or is the department of
 
02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
education withdrawing this document as a
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
as a guide
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
i was told by the attorney working for
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
the department at the time we just took
 
02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
it down because uh because of the
 
02:34:09.429 --> 02:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
revisions to the website if you still
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
abide by that old document you will
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
still be in compliance with the records
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
retention schedule um i i can access it
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
but i i want to save everybody's time
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's probably six or eight pages long i
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
mean it's got everything from federal
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
grants and income tax records and you
 
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
know all sorts of you know federal
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
documents that are required just you
 
02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
know based on the federal money that
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
school districts get some uh you know
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
workers comp type of documents bond
 
02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
issues things of that nature it's
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
massively comprehensive so
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
looking at looking at the the records
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
with the revision to this bill
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
public record and public records which
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
shall be retained for compliance with
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
rsa 91a includes but it's not limited to
 
02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:55.349 align:start position:0%
rsa 91a includes but it's not limited to
well

02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
retained for how long because the
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
records retention schedule previously
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
proffered by the department of education
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
at certain time limits on them you know
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
if this federal grant document has to be
 
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
maintained for for 10 years an
 
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
employment document has to be maintained
 
02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
for x number of years our workers comp
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
file has to be maintained for x number
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
of years so simply by by by listing
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
these saying they have to be retained is
 
02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
that permanently
 
02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
i just i still don't i still don't get
 
02:35:25.030 --> 02:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
what this is trying to get at and we
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
still have the problematic language in
 
02:35:28.309 --> 02:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
here about the student information
 
02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%

introduced i you know i haven't done a
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
deep dive into the amendment but just a
 
02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
quick glance we would certainly oppose
 
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:42.800 align:start position:0%

hb 1579
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
as a knowledgeable advocate for rail
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
trails in new hampshire and their health
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
recreational environmental and economic
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
benefits i've identified a
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
barrier to rails with trails in new
 
04:01:54.950 --> 04:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire that this
 
04:01:57.189 --> 04:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
04:01:57.199 --> 04:01:58.830 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
can

04:01:58.830 --> 04:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:02:01.830 --> 04:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
remedy where active rail lines exist is
 
04:02:03.750 --> 04:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
often the corridor
 
04:02:06.950 --> 04:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
that provides the best connecting link
 
04:02:11.910 --> 04:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
for our state ride rail trail network
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
owners of active rail lines are
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
justifiably concerned
 
04:02:20.150 --> 04:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
about potential liability
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
from their shared use of their
 
04:02:21.760 --> 04:02:24.070 align:start position:0%
from their shared use of their
right-of-way

04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
right-of-way
 
04:02:26.150 --> 04:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to overcome that
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
potential liability
 
04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
and the concern
 
04:02:32.469 --> 04:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
just as legislation in other states has
 
04:02:32.479 --> 04:02:33.429 align:start position:0%
just as legislation in other states has
done

04:02:33.429 --> 04:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.150 --> 04:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
i am offering an amendment to hb 1579
 
04:02:42.160 --> 04:02:43.110 align:start position:0%
i am offering an amendment to hb 1579
this

04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
liability problem was
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention by the timbaland
 
04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
owners association of new hampshire
 
04:02:50.160 --> 04:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
owners association of new hampshire
and

04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:53.670 --> 04:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
they identified this problem for me and
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
an amendment is a result of that and you
 
04:02:58.150 --> 04:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
should have that
 
04:03:03.750 --> 04:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:03.760 --> 04:03:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:03:05.750 --> 04:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:07.150 --> 04:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
1579 primarily eliminates for railroad
 
04:03:11.520 --> 04:03:12.710 align:start position:0%
1579 primarily eliminates for railroad
operators

04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
operators
 
04:03:12.720 --> 04:03:14.070 align:start position:0%
operators
that

04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:18.150 --> 04:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
allow a trail adjacent to their tracks
 
04:03:21.030 --> 04:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
and graces greatly increases our ability
 
04:03:23.590 --> 04:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
to create a world-class network of rail
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
trails in new hampshire
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
for our for our recreational uses and
 
04:03:30.070 --> 04:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
also for
 
04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
alternative transportation and i hope
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
that you focus that this is the goal of
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:03:36.399 --> 04:03:37.429 align:start position:0%
the bill
to

04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate liability for the railroad
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
operators that's the real goal of this
 
04:03:44.150 --> 04:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
bill so please keep that in mind as you

04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
committee my name is israel piedra i'm a
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative from manchester ward 2.
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
by way of disclosure i'm also a lawyer
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
and i practice
 
04:05:12.150 --> 04:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
representing both plaintiffs and
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
defendants but
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
i typically plant us in
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
personal injury matters when i practice
 
04:05:21.429 --> 04:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
in that area of law so i have
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
experience in this area and what this
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill affects
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
i think the bill is well-intentioned i
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
think it
 
04:05:32.309 --> 04:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
is designed to assist you know something
 
04:05:32.319 --> 04:05:33.590 align:start position:0%
is designed to assist you know something
that

04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:36.150 --> 04:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of of which is
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
rail trails
 
04:05:37.439 --> 04:05:38.630 align:start position:0%
rail trails
um

04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:38.640 --> 04:05:39.910 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:05:42.070 --> 04:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think that the bill would also have
 
04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
very negative consequences
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
the entire purpose of tort law which is
 
04:05:50.950 --> 04:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
what this affects is to deter
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
negligent conduct
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
the possibility of liability in tort
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
for landowners and other defendants
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
creates an incentive for those
 
04:06:04.469 --> 04:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
landowners to maintain their property in
 
04:06:06.150 --> 04:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
a safe manner so that people that come
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
onto that property aren't injured
 
04:06:10.229 --> 04:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
when you remove that incentive by
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
removing liability
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
there no longer is a reason for
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
landowners to make sure that their land
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
is safe
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill does
 
04:06:22.950 --> 04:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
the representatives question was well
 
04:06:22.960 --> 04:06:25.510 align:start position:0%
the representatives question was well
taken

04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:28.870 --> 04:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
this bill immunizes negligent conduct
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
that is the purpose of the bill
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
without negligence there is no liability
 
04:06:35.830 --> 04:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
if you're injured on someone's property
 
04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
that person is not liable unless you can
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
prove that they were negligent what this
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill does is say
 
04:06:46.870 --> 04:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
if i go into court and i prove to a jury
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
that this landowner was negligent and
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
caused my injuries despite all that
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
there is no possibility of recovery and
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
that landowner has immunity
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that's unacceptable i
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
think it's contrary to
 
04:07:01.199 --> 04:07:02.070 align:start position:0%
think it's contrary to
our

04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
system of justice that's existed for
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years in our jury system
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire that's why i
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill and i know other
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
speakers will elaborate on the specifics
 
04:07:13.349 --> 04:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill but i just wanted to
 
04:07:15.429 --> 04:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
register my opposition to it
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%

and
 
04:08:01.670 --> 04:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
the other ones no i'm kidding franklin

ward 3 and bosque
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
so i'm here today to speak in support of
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1579 and specifically more to
 
04:08:13.389 --> 04:08:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
202-158-h brings
 
04:08:18.149 --> 04:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
these changes in the amendment uh
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
specifically page one line 13 and the
 
04:08:23.670 --> 04:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
landowner definition and on page two the
 
04:08:26.790 --> 04:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
landowner liability limited
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
in providing services to will will
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
greatly help this bill
 
04:08:33.110 --> 04:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
so outdoor recreation is a huge part of
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's economy
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
this recreation depends on the
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
willingness of landowners to open up
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
their lands and trails
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
unlike other parts of the country where
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
either much of the land is either owned
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
by government or is presumed posted
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
unless permission is obtained
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
most new hampshire land owners share
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
their land with others where the land is
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
open excuse me for pedestrian traffic
 
04:08:57.990 --> 04:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
and traditional recreation unless it is
 
04:08:58.000 --> 04:08:59.189 align:start position:0%
and traditional recreation unless it is
posted

04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
posted
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
this is just part of our culture
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
what keeps this culture going is a
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
landowner's ability to manage the land
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
to economically justify its ownership
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
and a favorable regulatory and legal
 
04:09:10.080 --> 04:09:11.349 align:start position:0%
and a favorable regulatory and legal
climate

04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
climate
 
04:09:14.469 --> 04:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
this includes liability protection
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
amendment 158h addresses what i would
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
call a gap in our state's landowner
 
04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
liability protection law
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
it will include a person providing
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
services to the landowner the same duty
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
of care protections the landowner itself
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
currently receives
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
as someone who owns land and provides
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
services to other outer land owners such
 
04:09:37.110 --> 04:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
as custom harvesting field mowing i was
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
surprised to hear of a legal action
 
04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
occurring against a logging contractor
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
by an ohrb rider using a state trail on
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
the parcel where they were cutting
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
i started thinking of my liability as i
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
provide services to other landowners
 
04:09:53.590 --> 04:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
it is legal actions like the one i heard
 
04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
about that compel landowners to post
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
their property
 
04:09:59.110 --> 04:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
it also sends a ripple through the
 
04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
entire landowner community where they
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
now evaluate exposures for them or the
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
contractors doing work on their property
 
04:10:09.510 --> 04:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
i also agree all people should be held
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
accountable for their personal actions
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
and this includes landowners and those
 
04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
who provide services to them
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
this accountability is found in rsa 212
 
04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
34 paragraph five a landowner cannot
 
04:10:24.149 --> 04:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
willfully intentionally or maliciously
 
04:10:24.159 --> 04:10:25.189 align:start position:0%
willfully intentionally or maliciously
create

04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
create
 
04:10:27.189 --> 04:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
or fail to warn against
 
04:10:29.189 --> 04:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
dangerous situations
 
04:10:30.790 --> 04:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
passing house bill 1579 with amendment
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
158h will maintain this accountability
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
and will provide the state's landowners
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
an assurance that while their land is
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
open to recreation
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
they and those working on their behalf
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
will have the liability protection that
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
they need
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
this this is a big thing for many of us
 
04:10:51.189 --> 04:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
who own land as we
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
contemplate how much public traffic that
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
we allow to come on to our properties
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
and having this uh
 
04:11:00.710 --> 04:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
this gap in protection is
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
a real problem for some of us who are
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
considering providing services to those
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
other land so i would really encourage
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
you to take a look at this and
 
04:11:12.309 --> 04:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.990 --> 04:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative walper
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
if you are just allowing people to use
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
your land for recreational purposes you
 
04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
already have no liability
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
but that's you already protected under
 
04:11:31.359 --> 04:11:32.950 align:start position:0%
but that's you already protected under
other

04:11:32.950 --> 04:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
other laws in the state of new hampshire
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
so the land owner is it's when you are
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
doing contracted services so my
 
04:11:41.110 --> 04:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of the case that i'm aware
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the landowner also has a a logging
 
04:11:44.000 --> 04:11:45.429 align:start position:0%
of the landowner also has a a logging
operation

04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
operation
 
04:11:49.110 --> 04:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
where he was moving some trees and the
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
the accident that occurred which has
 
04:11:53.189 --> 04:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
caused the incident they didn't sue him
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
as a landowner they decided to sue him
 
04:11:56.469 --> 04:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
as a business owner so that they could
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
avoid this statute that's my
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of the situation
 
04:12:01.600 --> 04:12:02.550 align:start position:0%
understanding of the situation
yes

04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:12:02.560 --> 04:12:03.510 align:start position:0%
yes
so

04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
the protection that we give landowners
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
which is part of that is the current use
 
04:12:07.359 --> 04:12:08.389 align:start position:0%
which is part of that is the current use
line

04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
and the protections that go with it
 
04:12:13.030 --> 04:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
to encourage recreation what you're
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
saying is that landowners need more
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
protection than that
 
04:12:21.110 --> 04:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
because sometimes they aren't just using
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
given their land for recreation they're
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
doing other
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
business enterprises
 
04:12:27.429 --> 04:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
and they all should be protected is that
 
04:12:29.189 --> 04:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
what you're saying well i'm saying that
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know if if someone is doing a an
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
activity like forest harvesting this
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
kind of really where this is aimed at
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
and there's a situation that arises
 
04:12:40.870 --> 04:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
obviously they can't be negligent in
 
04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
their actions and from my understanding
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
of the case that's pending they weren't
 
04:12:45.990 --> 04:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
but speaking in general as long as
 
04:12:47.590 --> 04:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're not negligent in their actions
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
then you need the protection as a
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
business providing services as well as
 
04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
the landowner or it would really
 
04:12:53.680 --> 04:12:55.590 align:start position:0%
the landowner or it would really
potentially

04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
cause some of us who do provide services
 
04:12:59.830 --> 04:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
to consider doing so in the areas of
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
i i guess the
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
the the only question that represented
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
google when she was testifying was
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
saying that this this bill was directed
 
04:13:15.199 --> 04:13:16.309 align:start position:0%
saying that this this bill was directed
at

04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
railroads in particular owners of
 
04:13:18.399 --> 04:13:19.590 align:start position:0%
railroads in particular owners of
railroads

04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
railroads
 
04:13:19.600 --> 04:13:20.790 align:start position:0%
railroads
but

04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
having read the amendment and having
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
heard your testimony it appears that
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
this is directed to
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
anybody not just railroads would be
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.870 --> 04:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
using the property
 
04:13:38.229 --> 04:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
well it would provide protection for
 
04:13:39.990 --> 04:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
those that are doing services on the
 
04:13:41.670 --> 04:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
property again
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
logging in specific is one that i'm
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
thinking of
 
04:13:44.560 --> 04:13:47.510 align:start position:0%
thinking of
so

04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:51.030 --> 04:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
to logging uh so
 
04:13:58.710 --> 04:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
your your interest as you've expressed
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
it is with regard to and you with regard
 
04:14:02.309 --> 04:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
to the example you used as with regard
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
to logging
 
04:14:03.840 --> 04:14:04.630 align:start position:0%
to logging
but

04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to come on the property
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
for other purposes like mowing
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
a piece of property and
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
they were to engage in negligent
 
04:14:17.110 --> 04:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
activity while they're on the property
 
04:14:20.149 --> 04:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
while they're using liability
 
04:14:21.510 --> 04:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
if they're negligent
 
04:14:23.110 --> 04:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
again there there's other provisions
 
04:14:25.030 --> 04:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
that protect that i'm going to actually
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
have you
 
04:14:27.429 --> 04:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
jason stock would probably be able to
 
04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
answer this better he's a lot more
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
in-depth knowledge on this
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
so i think i'd ask you to reserve that
 
04:14:36.149 --> 04:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
question and ask him if you wouldn't
 
04:14:36.159 --> 04:14:37.110 align:start position:0%
question and ask him if you wouldn't
mind

04:14:37.110 --> 04:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
mind
 
04:14:40.710 --> 04:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:44.790 --> 04:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.710 --> 04:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:14:46.720 --> 04:14:47.429 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
my

04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
question representative um you were
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
highlighting two specific parts of the
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that you wanted to draw our
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
attention to and i just missed the
 
04:14:54.479 --> 04:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
attention to and i just missed the
second

04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
the second reference you made sure page
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
one line thirteen which is the landowner
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
definition and then page two line six
 
04:15:02.000 --> 04:15:02.710 align:start position:0%
definition and then page two line six
the

04:15:02.710 --> 04:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
landowner liability limited in the
 
04:15:07.590 --> 04:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
addition of providing services to
 
04:15:09.189 --> 04:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
so that would offer someone who's
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
providing services that that same
 
04:15:11.439 --> 04:15:12.710 align:start position:0%
providing services that that same
protection

04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
protection

and
we

04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
are opposing this bill this amendment to
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
the recreational
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
immunity statutes
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh what i do first wish to
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
to say is that
 
04:16:28.710 --> 04:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
it is our understanding as the uh mr
 
04:16:31.269 --> 04:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
chairperson has uh indicated that this
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
originated as
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
um a bill that would facilitate the
 
04:16:37.349 --> 04:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
creation and management of rail trails
 
04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
or rail rails with trail
 
04:16:42.790 --> 04:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
and um i am an enormous fan of
 
04:16:44.710 --> 04:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
rail trails my family and i have logged
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
hundreds of miles on them the northern
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
rail trail the winnipesaukee river trail
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
we've done the ghost train races down
 
04:16:53.189 --> 04:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
amherst to brookline they are wonderful
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
recreational opportunities for families
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
04:17:03.189 --> 04:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
dramatically expand the definitions
 
04:17:04.790 --> 04:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
04:17:04.800 --> 04:17:06.070 align:start position:0%
and i think
undermine

04:17:06.070 --> 04:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
undermine
 
04:17:08.070 --> 04:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
on what this
 
04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
this statute was originally meant to do
 
04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
the statutes 2 12 34
 
04:17:14.399 --> 04:17:15.830 align:start position:0%
the statutes 2 12 34
and

04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
508 14
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
their purpose
 
04:17:20.710 --> 04:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
was to
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
protect landowners with large expanses
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
of land who open that land to the public
 
04:17:27.590 --> 04:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
and say
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
please you know enjoy my land have at it
 
04:17:31.510 --> 04:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't necessarily know what's out
 
04:17:31.520 --> 04:17:32.389 align:start position:0%
but i don't necessarily know what's out
there

04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm not going to
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
be responsible if something were to go
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
wrong with something that i'd
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not having control over
 
04:17:40.399 --> 04:17:42.309 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not having control over
whatever

04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:17:44.469 --> 04:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
but the case in case law and the case
 
04:17:44.479 --> 04:17:46.070 align:start position:0%
but the case in case law and the case
interpretation

04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
of this of these statutes that has
 
04:17:48.319 --> 04:17:49.349 align:start position:0%
of this of these statutes that has
occurred

04:17:49.349 --> 04:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
04:17:51.429 --> 04:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh over the past few years
 
04:17:54.309 --> 04:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
even more broadly expands the immunities
 
04:17:54.319 --> 04:17:56.229 align:start position:0%
even more broadly expands the immunities
available

04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:17:58.469 --> 04:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
the case co-envy department of
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
04:18:02.790 --> 04:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
essentially stands for the fact that if
 
04:18:06.630 --> 04:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
one crosses land to get to
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
an area in that case specifically a body
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
of water
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
where two boys drown
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
if they cross the land to get to that
 
04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
area to engage in recreational activity
 
04:18:19.349 --> 04:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
then the landowner is immune
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
another case with which i have great
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
familiarity is dalva dalbervi city of
 
04:18:25.830 --> 04:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
laconia in which
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
it was decided that the list of
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
recreational activities in 21234
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
included not only activities where
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
people bring their own equipment
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
but the use of playground equipment
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
and specifically uh the use of
 
04:18:42.239 --> 04:18:43.910 align:start position:0%
and specifically uh the use of
structures

04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
structures
 
04:18:45.110 --> 04:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
in the interpretation of the word
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
structure in in the statute uh it is our
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
belief that the railroads and the
 
04:18:53.110 --> 04:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
railroad corridors and utility corridors
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
are exceedingly well protected already
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
and that this expansion of the
 
04:18:57.920 --> 04:18:59.030 align:start position:0%
and that this expansion of the
definition

04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
of the definitions in both statutes uh
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
is exceedingly broad and
 
04:19:05.910 --> 04:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
we have had conversations with various
 
04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh members of the rail trail
 
04:19:08.239 --> 04:19:09.269 align:start position:0%
uh members of the rail trail
community

04:19:09.269 --> 04:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:19:13.110 --> 04:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh who have indicated that you know yes
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know this is
 
04:19:16.070 --> 04:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know not necessarily wedded to this
 
04:19:17.910 --> 04:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
language because it does
 
04:19:20.790 --> 04:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
exceed what is necessary for uh rail
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
trails i'm not speaking for them in any
 
04:19:23.429 --> 04:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
way right now but just an
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement from them that this
 
04:19:25.520 --> 04:19:26.790 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement from them that this
exceeds

04:19:26.790 --> 04:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
exceeds
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
what the real
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
what the rail people would need
 
04:19:32.229 --> 04:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
indicating first if the
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the um
 
04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill on page on page one under premises
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
indicating the premises may include but
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
is not limited to improved and
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
unimproved lands private ways roads
 
04:19:46.630 --> 04:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
buildings and structures
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
such as lands as well as water standing
 
04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
on or flowing through or adjacent to
 
04:19:52.550 --> 04:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
those lands
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
again already protected already
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
protected under the current under the
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
statute and are already protected under
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
the case law interpretations of the
 
04:20:02.630 --> 04:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
statute but what we fear is that this
 
04:20:02.640 --> 04:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
statute but what we fear is that this
broadens

04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
broadens
 
04:20:05.349 --> 04:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
this the um
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
the this extends the immunity
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
not just to to rail trail and utility
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
corridors um which are likely going to
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
be better maintained monitored but to
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
anybody who owns land and has any number
 
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
of structures buildings on that land so
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know if a if a person decides
 
04:20:23.590 --> 04:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to open that land you know
 
04:20:25.269 --> 04:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
to to kids to play hide and seek in this
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
three or four old barns on the property
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know this is so they are going to be
 
04:20:33.030 --> 04:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
protected under the statute
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that perhaps they're
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
not monitoring these structures and the
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
status of their property as would
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
normally be expected we believe that
 
04:20:42.309 --> 04:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
in the the um expansions under you know
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
508 are equally unnecessary unnecessary
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
and potentially dangerous
 
04:20:53.910 --> 04:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
immunities breed irresponsibility as it
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
stands right now the protections are
 
04:20:57.830 --> 04:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
exceedingly broad
 
04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
this is unnecessary and unnecessarily
 
04:21:00.399 --> 04:21:02.229 align:start position:0%
this is unnecessary and unnecessarily
dangerous

04:21:02.229 --> 04:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
with that i would entertain any
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
questions the committee has
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%

well
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
and and the amendment
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
i want to give a quick just a very quick
 
04:23:22.149 --> 04:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
overview of the landscape that we're
 
04:23:24.389 --> 04:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
talking about and kind of why this bill
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
and in particular this amendment got our
 
04:23:26.479 --> 04:23:28.710 align:start position:0%
and in particular this amendment got our
attention

04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's 83 percent forested
 
04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
second most forested state in the nation
 
04:23:36.309 --> 04:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
72 privately owned
 
04:23:36.319 --> 04:23:37.269 align:start position:0%
72 privately owned
in

04:23:37.269 --> 04:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:23:39.590 --> 04:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
and much of that almost two-thirds of
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
that is open to pedestrian recreation
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
and that's based on information in your
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
packet but also a survey that we have
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
done of of current use land owners who
 
04:23:50.710 --> 04:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
open their land up
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of a lot of open land
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of things happening on it
 
04:23:55.840 --> 04:23:57.349 align:start position:0%
and a lot of things happening on it
recreationally

04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
recreationally
 
04:24:01.269 --> 04:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
hunting fishing hiking bird watching and
 
04:24:05.429 --> 04:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
and as we all know
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
recreation and outdoor recreation
 
04:24:11.110 --> 04:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
tourism is certainly a big part of the
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
state's culture and economy
 
04:24:14.000 --> 04:24:15.110 align:start position:0%
state's culture and economy
um

04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:15.120 --> 04:24:16.870 align:start position:0%
um
we've

04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
we've
 
04:24:19.269 --> 04:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
when we look at as timberland owners
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things that we really
 
04:24:22.950 --> 04:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
need to to have in place to make
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
timberland ownership viable we need to
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
have markets
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
that enable it to be financially
 
04:24:28.479 --> 04:24:29.910 align:start position:0%
that enable it to be financially
justifiable

04:24:29.910 --> 04:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
justifiable
 
04:24:32.950 --> 04:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
we also need a good regulatory and and
 
04:24:34.389 --> 04:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
legal framework
 
04:24:36.630 --> 04:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
under which to own that property
 
04:24:39.269 --> 04:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
and liability landowner liability is a
 
04:24:41.429 --> 04:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
part of that particularly if you have a
 
04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
lot of land that is open
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
for recreation um
 
04:24:48.630 --> 04:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
on you know outdoor recreation occurring
 
04:24:50.149 --> 04:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
on your property
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the duty of care statute of
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
rsa 220 212 colon 34
 
04:25:04.710 --> 04:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:06.790 --> 04:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
we've been what we were watching and
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
certainly had an interest in the rail
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
trail bill
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
the timing was such that
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
this summer we got
 
04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
that bill had come out this
 
04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
obviously in
 
04:25:17.439 --> 04:25:18.630 align:start position:0%
obviously in
december

04:25:18.630 --> 04:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
december
 
04:25:21.110 --> 04:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
january this summer we
 
04:25:23.349 --> 04:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
had begun to catch wind of an incident
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
on a member's property
 
04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
where the member a suit had been brought
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
against them
 
04:25:30.870 --> 04:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain give you the the
 
04:25:30.880 --> 04:25:32.149 align:start position:0%
and i'll explain give you the the
details

04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
details
 
04:25:32.159 --> 04:25:33.030 align:start position:0%
details
and

04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
we thought there was a there was a gap
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
identif we identified a gap in some of
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
the liability coverage and we thought
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
this would be an opportunity to try and
 
04:25:43.590 --> 04:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
plug that gap
 
04:25:46.229 --> 04:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
here was the situation
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
landowner owns a piece of land
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
down in the hopkinton area they have a
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
trail that crosses their property it
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
happens to be it's a state trail happens
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
to be an old railroad bed
 
04:25:57.840 --> 04:25:58.790 align:start position:0%
to be an old railroad bed
um

04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
landowner also has a logging company
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're out there cutting their wood
 
04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
out there on a saturday they had been
 
04:26:06.000 --> 04:26:07.429 align:start position:0%
out there on a saturday they had been
dragging

04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
dragging
 
04:26:07.439 --> 04:26:08.710 align:start position:0%
dragging
tops

04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
tops
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
hemlock tops across the trail
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
the trail was not gouged he said it was
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
as if it had been swept if you can think
 
04:26:18.469 --> 04:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
of a hemlock tree like a pine tree
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
and while he was out there harvesting on
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
a saturday two ohrv riders
 
04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
have an accident right in the in the
 
04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
vicinity that he was in
 
04:26:30.550 --> 04:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
he said he hopped off the machine
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
ran over talked to them
 
04:26:35.670 --> 04:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
you guys all right do i call 9-1-1 nope
 
04:26:37.750 --> 04:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
nope no problem they hopped on their
 
04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
machines and drove off
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
he said wouldn't you know it a couple
 
04:26:44.790 --> 04:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
months later in my mail comes a letter
 
04:26:47.590 --> 04:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
in this case not to me as the landowner
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
but to me as a logging contractor
 
04:26:53.429 --> 04:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
saying you're liable for our damages or
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
bodily injury you failed to put up signs
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
warning of
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
that you're out there and he said in in
 
04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
his comment to me was
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know where does personal
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility end and begin
 
04:27:07.349 --> 04:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
on some of these things he says i have
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
my land open
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
he says i'm an ohrv enthusiast
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
i know that there's activities going on
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the woods he said clearly this trail
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
had not been
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
gouged he said it wasn't as if i was
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
hauling big red oak logs across it and
 
04:27:23.510 --> 04:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
and gouged it up or had big furrows
 
04:27:24.630 --> 04:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
across it
 
04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
and he says i offered assistance
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
and he says clearly they were capable
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
enough to hop on their machines and
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
write off but yet
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
here it comes a couple months later i
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
get i get i get a nice certified letter
 
04:27:37.830 --> 04:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
in the mail
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
he's in the process now of dealing with
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
his insurance company trying to settle
 
04:27:42.800 --> 04:27:43.590 align:start position:0%
his insurance company trying to settle
this

04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
and he said you know
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm out there i'm providing us and he
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
goes in this case i'm as a logging
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
company i'm cutting my own land
 
04:27:52.710 --> 04:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
but he says even if it was someone
 
04:27:55.110 --> 04:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
else's property i'm providing a service
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
to them a service that enables them to
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
continue to economically justify owning
 
04:28:01.990 --> 04:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
this property and keeping this land in
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
this trail open
 
04:28:05.189 --> 04:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
and and yet i'm i'm on the hook
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
i'm on the hook for this and he said
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
that just isn't right
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
we had talked about this rail trail bill
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
and whether or not there would be an
 
04:28:16.080 --> 04:28:17.269 align:start position:0%
and whether or not there would be an
opportunity

04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
and so today
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
what you have before you is is our
 
04:28:23.349 --> 04:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
attempt at a solution to try to
 
04:28:25.750 --> 04:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
make it clear that if you are out there
 
04:28:27.510 --> 04:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
providing services on behalf of that
 
04:28:27.520 --> 04:28:28.870 align:start position:0%
providing services on behalf of that
landowner

04:28:28.870 --> 04:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
your and again back to the question of
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
negligence you can't be out there
 
04:28:36.790 --> 04:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
and you heard this already before today
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
there is some responsibility to that
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
landowner in that operator
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
i mean in rsa 212 34a roman 5
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
you can't be willful you can't be you
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
can't be
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
i have the language here
 
04:28:55.349 --> 04:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
malicious willful
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:01.670 --> 04:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
so there's a coverage there so the
 
04:29:03.910 --> 04:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
argument that well this will just kind
 
04:29:05.670 --> 04:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
of open the floodgates
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
landowners are totally protected and
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
immune from anyone bringing a case to
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
them we would argue no they're not and
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
we would argue that
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's still that hook there that if
 
04:29:17.110 --> 04:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
i'm out there and i'm doing something
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
foolish but right now this particular
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
owner is going through the process of
 
04:29:23.590 --> 04:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
having to deal with
 
04:29:27.269 --> 04:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
attorneys insurance agents etc
 
04:29:29.910 --> 04:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
for for what he believes is a
 
04:29:32.309 --> 04:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
a frivolous frivolous case that's been
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
brought up brought against him
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
and so that's
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's our
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
our testimony we would hope you would
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
look favorably on this
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be work on the bill
 
04:29:44.950 --> 04:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
or further
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
further discussion about it we would
 
04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
love to be a participant in that
 
04:29:51.269 --> 04:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
i will tell you this
 
04:29:51.279 --> 04:29:52.469 align:start position:0%
i will tell you this
incident

04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
incident
 
04:29:54.389 --> 04:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
this was a significant landowner this
 
04:29:55.910 --> 04:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
incident has gotten the attention of
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
other landowners
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
i get questions so what if someone i'm
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
doing a timber sale someone walks across
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
my property and a
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
dead fall falls across on their head am
 
04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
i now supposed to put signage up around
 
04:30:11.349 --> 04:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
my timber sale saying tree limbs tree
 
04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
limbs in the trees that may fall down he
 
04:30:15.990 --> 04:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
said where does it end and so
 
04:30:17.830 --> 04:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
this was our attempt to try and address
 
04:30:17.840 --> 04:30:18.790 align:start position:0%
this was our attempt to try and address
this

04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
and again i'd be happy to work with the
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
committee if there's a subcommittee
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
however you folks operate
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
and provide some more insight you're
 
04:30:28.149 --> 04:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
going to hear from some other landowners
 
04:30:30.550 --> 04:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
today that have recreation occurring on
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
the property and kind of get their
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
thoughts and insight so with that i'll
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and be happy to
 
04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions
 
04:30:39.120 --> 04:30:40.229 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions
questions

04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative otter thank you mr
 
04:30:43.830 --> 04:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
question i'm just trying to simplify
 
04:30:45.760 --> 04:30:46.790 align:start position:0%
question i'm just trying to simplify
this

04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
so is this correct
 
04:30:50.469 --> 04:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
a person owns property and out of the
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
goodness of their heart they let others
 
04:30:54.070 --> 04:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
go on to their property to use a rail
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
trail or whatever and then if the person
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
gets hurt on this private property this
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
amendment will keep them will stop them
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
from being able to sue them
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
yes and no
 
04:31:09.110 --> 04:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
simply right now landowners if you're
 
04:31:11.189 --> 04:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
the landowner if you hold that deed or
 
04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
if you're the lessee that's already in
 
04:31:13.359 --> 04:31:14.229 align:start position:0%
if you're the lessee that's already in
law

04:31:14.229 --> 04:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
but in this case if you are i'm working
 
04:31:19.349 --> 04:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
for you on your property providing a
 
04:31:20.710 --> 04:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
service for you
 
04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
and that individual gets injured this
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
would and again and if i'm not negligent
 
04:31:27.510 --> 04:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
this would afford me the same types of
 
04:31:27.520 --> 04:31:33.189 align:start position:0%
this would afford me the same types of
protections

04:31:33.189 --> 04:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question sir um in the um
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
example that you mentioned about the
 
04:31:51.110 --> 04:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
over the o b h f whatever
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
ohb you vehicle
 
04:31:57.189 --> 04:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:58.870 --> 04:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
when i spoke to the logger he said they
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
did they did have some cuts scrapes and
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
bruises on them he said they did i
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
offered to call
 
04:32:07.189 --> 04:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
i offered to help him out
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
he said
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
they declined any
 
04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
any effort they hopped on their machines
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
and sped off so he did say there were
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
some scrapes and bruises and that was
 
04:32:19.510 --> 04:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
his description of how it went down
 
04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:26.070 --> 04:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
oh i thought i'm sorry
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
04:32:34.469 --> 04:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
as i read this every logger would be uh
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
protected and every landowner would be
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
protected when loggers were cutting on
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
their land
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
so the so it the what the amendment does
 
04:32:44.550 --> 04:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
if i'm a logger i'm providing services
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
to that landowner
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not negligent i'm not malicious
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
landowners are already protected that's
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
our intent on this
 
04:33:00.309 --> 04:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
if someone's injured
 
04:33:02.469 --> 04:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's how we interpret this language
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
if i'm providing if i'm that longer and
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
i'm providing the service
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
someone's injured
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not i don't fall under that
 
04:33:09.920 --> 04:33:11.189 align:start position:0%
and i'm not i don't fall under that
category

04:33:11.189 --> 04:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
category
 
04:33:11.199 --> 04:33:12.551 align:start position:0%
category
five

04:33:12.551 --> 04:33:12.561 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
i would be our interpretation is i would
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
be afforded a duty of care that's not to
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
say someone still can't try to bring a
 
04:33:21.189 --> 04:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
suit but we believe this will provide an
 
04:33:25.750 --> 04:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
other questions represented sylvia
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:33:31.520 --> 04:33:34.390 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:37.990 --> 04:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
so the case that you're talking about
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
the incident
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
the landowner is not being sued his
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
company is being sued correct
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.799 --> 04:33:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
this

04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.920 --> 04:33:53.429 align:start position:0%
 
protects

04:33:53.429 --> 04:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
protects
 
04:33:53.439 --> 04:33:54.709 align:start position:0%
protects
the

04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
logger no matter where he is
 
04:33:57.199 --> 04:33:58.869 align:start position:0%
logger no matter where he is
correct

04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:34:01.750 --> 04:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
i guess i have one question that so
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
the scenario that you've painted with
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
the logger down in the hopkinton area
 
04:34:13.439 --> 04:34:14.629 align:start position:0%
the logger down in the hopkinton area
the

04:34:14.629 --> 04:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:34:18.470 --> 04:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
so let's say the logger was
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
dragging the hemlock across the railroad
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
right away
 
04:34:21.920 --> 04:34:23.189 align:start position:0%
right away
and

04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
as you said he was just brushing it but
 
04:34:28.230 --> 04:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
let's say he left a gouge
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
in it and the
 
04:34:33.510 --> 04:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
rv or the snowmobile
 
04:34:35.590 --> 04:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
hit that gouge went off and somebody was
 
04:34:35.600 --> 04:34:39.109 align:start position:0%
hit that gouge went off and somebody was
injured

04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
would this excuse them from liability
 
04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think it would depend on the nature of
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
the accident the nature of the gouge
 
04:34:52.240 --> 04:34:53.109 align:start position:0%
the accident the nature of the gouge
again

04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
i think what they would what it would do
 
04:34:55.039 --> 04:34:56.310 align:start position:0%
i think what they would what it would do
is

04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
cause a burden of proof that they were
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
in fact negligent under that roman
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
numeral five
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
and so were they
 
04:35:05.590 --> 04:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
did they knowingly
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know did they knowingly have a
 
04:35:09.029 --> 04:35:09.039 align:start position:0%
hazard out there
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
if if and so that's that's how we in
 
04:35:13.990 --> 04:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's how we interpret this
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer and i don't pretend to
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
be one i'm a tree guy
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
did that do it here we go
 
04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me a few minutes to
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
address the committee on this bill my
 
04:36:07.269 --> 04:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
name is roger turgeon i am a governor at
 
04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
large of the new hampshire association
 
04:36:11.910 --> 04:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
for justice i am a dover native and
 
04:36:14.789 --> 04:36:14.799 align:start position:0%
current resident of rochester um i have
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
been a practicing in uh practicing
 
04:36:19.750 --> 04:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
attorney handling nothing but personal
 
04:36:22.629 --> 04:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
injury cases for over 40 years in new
 
04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
i am also a rail trail
 
04:36:30.000 --> 04:36:31.029 align:start position:0%
i am also a rail trail
fan

04:36:31.029 --> 04:36:31.039 align:start position:0%
fan
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
i've ridden hundreds of miles on rail
 
04:36:35.590 --> 04:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
trails in various states i contribute to
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
the national rail trails conservancy
 
04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a big fan of them
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
this bill unfortunately goes way beyond
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
the original intention of making it
 
04:36:48.390 --> 04:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
easier for rail trails to be put
 
04:36:48.400 --> 04:36:49.510 align:start position:0%
easier for rail trails to be put
together

04:36:49.510 --> 04:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
you've already seen the first parts of
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
the slippery slope that it introduces
 
04:36:55.910 --> 04:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
which is the lumbermen jumping in and
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
saying hey
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
immunize us too
 
04:37:01.269 --> 04:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
if you look at the statute it also
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
actually immunizes anybody else who's
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
doing just about anything
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
on property let me first clarify i was
 
04:37:09.910 --> 04:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
really planning on speaking only about
 
04:37:11.910 --> 04:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
one issue and that is the leasing
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
exception to what is a charge i'll talk
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
about that in a moment but i'd like to
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple things i've heard
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
in the last few minutes the last speaker
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
in particular kept saying oh no it
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't immunize you if you're negligent
 
04:37:26.830 --> 04:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
true the recreational use statute has
 
04:37:32.470 --> 04:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
always stood for the proposition
 
04:37:35.349 --> 04:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
that you are immune from being sued for
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
negligent activity
 
04:37:38.949 --> 04:37:38.959 align:start position:0%
so long as you're if you're letting
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
people use your land for free you're not
 
04:37:44.470 --> 04:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
charging them even if you are negligent
 
04:37:46.629 --> 04:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
in allowing a defect on the property
 
04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
that creates a danger and hurts or kills
 
04:37:48.879 --> 04:37:49.910 align:start position:0%
that creates a danger and hurts or kills
people

04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
you cannot be suitable you could be sued
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
but you'll get thrown out you know the
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
person will get thrown out you can only
 
04:37:58.150 --> 04:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
lose a case if you acted willfully and
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
wantonly and i can tell you in the state
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
04:38:03.670 --> 04:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
of the thousands and thousands of cases
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
that are brought that allege negligence
 
04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
for various things
 
04:38:08.639 --> 04:38:09.750 align:start position:0%
for various things
maybe

04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
one tenth of one percent of them present
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
facts that would qualify as willful and
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
wanton it is an extremely difficult
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
burden for a plaintiff to prove that the
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
a big concern i have is what we just
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
heard about lumberjacking contractors
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
coming on the property the foundation of
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
recreational use immunities
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
is to say if you own land and you're
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
letting people use it out of the
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
goodness of your heart
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
not charging them then we're not going
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
to hold you responsible if that hand
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
that land has potholes or branches of
 
04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
trees that are about to fall off as you
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
pass under or you know a body of water
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
that you should look out for you know
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to have to go put fences
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
around my water and around the quarry
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that that's all well and
 
04:39:00.150 --> 04:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
good we support that i sup i've always
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
supported that i think it's a great idea
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
one of the problems here is now that you
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
start saying contractors let's assume
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
first of all let me suggest it is not a
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
great idea
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
for committees like you or for
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
individuals to be proposing bills to fix
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
every single perceived frivolous lawsuit
 
04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
that happens that's what the courts are
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
for if that case that we just heard
 
04:39:25.910 --> 04:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
about is as frivolous as it sounds it's
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
not going to go anywhere that's what we
 
04:39:29.109 --> 04:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
have insurance for that's not a big deal
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
nobody's insurance rates are going to go
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
up nobody's going to go out of business
 
04:39:34.709 --> 04:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
what if in that case
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
the the lumbering contractor was not the
 
04:39:38.310 --> 04:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
owner of the property it's somebody
 
04:39:39.670 --> 04:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
making money
 
04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
being paid to take the lumber off that
 
04:39:46.070 --> 04:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
property produce it sell it
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
pay some over to the landowner for the
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
basic product
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
they're being paid
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
why does that person need to be
 
04:39:54.868 --> 04:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
immunized from acting
 
04:39:54.878 --> 04:39:55.990 align:start position:0%
immunized from acting
reasonably

04:39:55.990 --> 04:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
reasonably
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
from not being negligent
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
so let's assume that they did you you
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
asked a question um what if they did
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
leave a gouge what if they know that
 
04:40:05.360 --> 04:40:06.470 align:start position:0%
leave a gouge what if they know that
there's

04:40:06.470 --> 04:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:40:08.310 --> 04:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
hundreds of
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
of of snow sleds passing through those
 
04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
trails that weekend and they go out to
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
do their lumbering
 
04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
and in lumbering they're dragging things
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
across the trails left and right knowing
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
that they're creating all sorts of
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
hazards they're around a corner and they
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't bother to tell anybody oh by the
 
04:40:27.670 --> 04:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
way there's logging up ahead
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
or what if they decide let's put a chain
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
across here to keep people from coming
 
04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
into our logging operations and they
 
04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't bother putting flags on the chain
 
04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
so someone's coming on their ohrv at 50
 
04:40:40.150 --> 04:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
miles an hour and they get a chain
 
04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
across the neck because it wasn't
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
flagged that's negligent almost
 
04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
certainly not willful and wanton
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
that would be immunized under this
 
04:40:48.320 --> 04:40:49.750 align:start position:0%
that would be immunized under this
statue

04:40:49.750 --> 04:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
statue
 
04:40:49.760 --> 04:40:51.270 align:start position:0%
statue
already

04:40:51.270 --> 04:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
well i'm sorry under the under the uh
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
under the additions being made to bring
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
so i'll leave that at that let me talk
 
04:41:04.390 --> 04:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
about the basic foundation again being
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
free use
 
04:41:08.788 --> 04:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
my concern is the lease provision
 
04:41:08.798 --> 04:41:10.390 align:start position:0%
my concern is the lease provision
under

04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:41:12.150 --> 04:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
the statute says basically you're not
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
going to be liable for ordinary
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
negligence if you don't charge for use
 
04:41:17.670 --> 04:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
of your land
 
04:41:18.868 --> 04:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
and then it says well there's all sorts
 
04:41:20.550 --> 04:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
of things we call charging and not
 
04:41:21.910 --> 04:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
charging and one of the things that says
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
is not a charge is if you lease your
 
04:41:23.840 --> 04:41:25.110 align:start position:0%
is not a charge is if you lease your
land

04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
land
 
04:41:27.750 --> 04:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
so let's say i only let's say i own
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
a six flags operation i own canopy lake
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
state park i own a park with all sorts
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
of amusements on it thinks it can be
 
04:41:37.110 --> 04:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
extremely dangerous if i don't act
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
prudently and maintain it
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
right now i'll be liable if i let a car
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
fly off the rails or something kids get
 
04:41:48.070 --> 04:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
hurt or maimed or killed i'll i can be
 
04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
sued i'll be held liable that's my
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
primary incentive for maintaining it and
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
keeping it safe
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
now under this statute it says if i
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
lease my property even if i lease it for
 
04:42:01.750 --> 04:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
good money i'm not liable for what
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
happens on my land anymore
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
so why don't i set up a non-profit
 
04:42:06.240 --> 04:42:07.670 align:start position:0%
so why don't i set up a non-profit
corporation

04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
that non-profit corporation says its
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
purpose is to allow children of all ages
 
04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
including you know
 
04:42:16.708 --> 04:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
octogenarians and old people like me um
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
to go out and come play
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i lease it to that i leased my own
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
property to my own non-profit
 
04:42:23.200 --> 04:42:24.708 align:start position:0%
property to my own non-profit
corporation

04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
04:42:24.718 --> 04:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
corporation
for

04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:42:27.190 --> 04:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
as much money as i could possibly have
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
hoped to make in profit by running the
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
business but i let the nonprofit
 
04:42:33.190 --> 04:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
actually run the business
 
04:42:35.750 --> 04:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
i no longer have to maintain
 
04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
my roller coasters i don't have to
 
04:42:39.670 --> 04:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
maintain my bungee jumping stations i
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to maintain anything because
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
i don't have to be worried about being
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
sued for negligence
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
even though
 
04:42:49.510 --> 04:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
the non-profit is paying me as much as i
 
04:42:50.788 --> 04:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
ever would have made if i did it for a
 
04:42:50.798 --> 04:42:52.390 align:start position:0%
ever would have made if i did it for a
profit

04:42:52.390 --> 04:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
profit
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
that is a huge loop loophole that will
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
eat up
 
04:42:59.110 --> 04:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
all of turtle as long as the property
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
has an arguably recreational use i can
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
set up this lease loophole set up a
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
non-profit and keep making money to my
 
04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
heart's content and not have to worry
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
about spending money on maintenance
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
unless my lack of maintenance is so bad
 
04:43:13.830 --> 04:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
that it amounts to willful and wanton
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that's i mean you know until you see
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
the roller coaster collapsing
 
04:43:18.948 --> 04:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
that kind of a case is not going to
 
04:43:21.750 --> 04:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
happen those are my major concerns
 
04:43:23.670 --> 04:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
recreational use statutes are a slippery
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%

is
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
showing how slippery it can be
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
other people started with rail trails
 
04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
and now others are already jumping on
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
saying me too me too it needs to stop
 
04:43:40.868 --> 04:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
i'm open for questions
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%

the duty of care

care of duty

peace of mind
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
all of us who own

04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
our land have seen
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
the large increase in use of our forest
 
04:47:01.830 --> 04:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the last two years due to covert 19

pandemic
 
04:47:04.948 --> 04:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
and the last thing we need to worry
 
04:47:07.190 --> 04:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
about because we open and share our
 
04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
lands with either our state or the
 
04:47:10.708 --> 04:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
general public
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
is one day receiving a certified letter
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the mail notifying us we or our agent
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
you will or have heard today that this
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
has already happened to a landowner who
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
owns the land
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
but also has a logging business and was
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
logging on his land and is now being
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
sued because of two four-wheelers that
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
had an accident on his property
 
04:47:44.070 --> 04:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
remember good forest management is only
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
one of many benefits private forest
 
04:47:49.030 --> 04:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
landowners provide in our state which
 
04:47:50.948 --> 04:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
brings into our state's
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
economy 1.4 billion in the forest
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
industry and provides 7400
 
04:48:00.150 --> 04:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
working workers employed in the forest
 
04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
products industry
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
which also adds to our tourism and
 
04:48:07.190 --> 04:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
recreational industries
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
one example would be snowmobiling which
 
04:48:11.670 --> 04:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
brings in annually direct and indirect
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
over 600 million dollars because forest
 
04:48:16.628 --> 04:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
land owners continue to open and share
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
our forest lands and trails which we
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
built for forestry
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
eighty-four percent of the state's seven
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
thousand two hundred mile trail systems
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
are on private forest lands
 
04:48:30.628 --> 04:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
please help private landowners by
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
supporting house bill 1579 in addition
 
04:48:37.590 --> 04:48:37.600 align:start position:0%

asking to consider
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
an anecdote about
 
04:48:59.670 --> 04:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
a landowner there's a logger being sued
 
04:49:01.270 --> 04:49:01.280 align:start position:0%

here that can identify the location of
 
04:49:16.798 --> 04:49:18.708 align:start position:0%
here that can identify the location of
that

04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%

my question
 
04:49:29.920 --> 04:49:30.948 align:start position:0%
my question
um

04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get a sense of how big an
 
04:49:34.868 --> 04:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
issue it is that we're talking about
 
04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
beyond the case that has been mentioned
 
04:49:39.510 --> 04:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering um
 
04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
you've been doing this a long time
 
04:49:43.030 --> 04:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
opening your land and personally thank
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
you for that um but i wonder in that in
 
04:49:47.910 --> 04:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
that time if you have ever
 
04:49:50.628 --> 04:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
been approached with a lawsuit by anyone
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
who's used your land
 
04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
we haven't
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
we have avoided that
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
up to to this point
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that we have had severe
 
04:50:01.760 --> 04:50:03.350 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that we have had severe
vandalism

04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
vandalism
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
on our property
 
04:50:08.708 --> 04:50:08.718 align:start position:0%

04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
deer stand there he went up in the deer
 
04:50:20.958 --> 04:50:21.990 align:start position:0%
deer stand there he went up in the deer
stand

04:50:21.990 --> 04:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
stand
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh and fell out of the deer stand and
 
04:50:25.830 --> 04:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
turned around and sued the land owner
 
04:50:27.510 --> 04:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
which was a farmer
 
04:50:27.520 --> 04:50:29.510 align:start position:0%
which was a farmer
uh

04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:50:29.520 --> 04:50:30.470 align:start position:0%
uh
that

04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
that one
 
04:50:36.070 --> 04:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
i believe it was thrown out of court or
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
it never got too far along as as far as
 
04:50:43.110 --> 04:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
the suit was however the farmer ended up
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
having to pay ten thousand dollars out
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
of his pocket to defend himself and
 
04:50:49.430 --> 04:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's what private land owners fear
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
every single day
 
04:50:53.190 --> 04:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
and and you know
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%

maybe in this state that private forest
 
04:51:07.910 --> 04:51:07.920 align:start position:0%

and after that vandalism i i was really
 
04:51:31.990 --> 04:51:32.000 align:start position:0%

thompson for taking my question
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
um i wanted to ask you about the damage
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
that from the vandalism that you
 
04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
suffered was that covered by insurance
 
04:53:46.948 --> 04:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
no uh what happened was in that
 
04:53:51.430 --> 04:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
particular case and keep in mind that we
 
04:53:53.430 --> 04:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
had had uh many
 
04:53:55.590 --> 04:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
cases of vandalism on our property but
 
04:53:56.788 --> 04:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
the trick is
 
04:53:59.350 --> 04:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
you have to catch him in the act
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
and that's very difficult to do but this
 
04:54:06.070 --> 04:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
on this day we caught them in the act
 
04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
they went to court
 
04:54:08.240 --> 04:54:09.430 align:start position:0%
they went to court
we

04:54:09.430 --> 04:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
found a judge that finally was serious
 
04:54:14.550 --> 04:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
about it and they find them each two
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:54:18.788 --> 04:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
and they and the judge told them
 
04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
be sure and look over your back because
 
04:54:22.868 --> 04:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
if one of you fails to pay i'm going
 
04:54:25.830 --> 04:54:25.840 align:start position:0%

made out of check
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%

04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
from lot to lot continually
 
04:56:41.190 --> 04:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
where the growth of the timber the
 
04:56:44.070 --> 04:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
markets and the weather warrant a cut
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
we log for the regeneration of the
 
04:56:45.840 --> 04:56:48.310 align:start position:0%
we log for the regeneration of the
forest

04:56:48.310 --> 04:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
forest
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
this is one way that we can make it
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
economically possible for us to continue
 
04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
to own and share with others thousands
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
of acres of land
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
i am here supporting house bill 1579 as
 
04:57:04.708 --> 04:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
well as representative gould's amendment
 
04:57:07.830 --> 04:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
adding the landowner's agent to the duty
 
04:57:09.510 --> 04:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
of care law
 
04:57:11.590 --> 04:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
we of all people understand the thrill
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
of uneven ground
 
04:57:15.430 --> 04:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
cool shade and loud motors in the woods
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
on a balmy summer day
 
04:57:19.030 --> 04:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
the sense of adventure
 
04:57:21.510 --> 04:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
on on the vast trails of new hampshire
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
is unbeatable
 
04:57:25.430 --> 04:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
unbeatable but
 
04:57:28.310 --> 04:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
the unknown is definitely there
 
04:57:31.110 --> 04:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
a flat trail at 10 miles an hour for
 
04:57:32.550 --> 04:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of miles
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
would be pretty boring it would be
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
nothing to drive up from massachusetts
 
04:57:36.878 --> 04:57:38.310 align:start position:0%
nothing to drive up from massachusetts
for

04:57:38.310 --> 04:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:57:40.948 --> 04:57:40.958 align:start position:0%
people trail ride for the unrestrained
 
04:57:44.230 --> 04:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
exploration of uninhabited land
 
04:57:46.628 --> 04:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
but if it's taken too far to where it
 
04:57:48.070 --> 04:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
becomes reckless
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
chaotic or dangerous the only person
 
04:57:53.110 --> 04:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
liable should be the one seeking the
 
04:57:53.120 --> 04:57:54.390 align:start position:0%
liable should be the one seeking the
thrill

04:57:54.390 --> 04:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
thrill
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
there should be
 
04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
expectations of wilderness on these
 
04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
trails including bumps turns trees and
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
rocks and stumps
 
04:58:07.350 --> 04:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
all that can be navigated safely by a
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
controlled rider
 
04:58:12.310 --> 04:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
where it becomes tricky is if a rider is
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
not in control becomes reckless and has
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
an accident
 
04:58:19.190 --> 04:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
in this case they may attempt to lay the
 
04:58:21.190 --> 04:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
blame elsewhere
 
04:58:23.990 --> 04:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
for example with a landowner
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
or a landowner's agent
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
the landowner has no control over who
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
uses the trails the ability the
 
04:58:31.840 --> 04:58:32.948 align:start position:0%
uses the trails the ability the
intention

04:58:32.948 --> 04:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
intention
 
04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
or the condition of the rider
 
04:58:37.270 --> 04:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
no control over whether the rules are
 
04:58:40.470 --> 04:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:42.550 --> 04:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
as a logging company
 
04:58:46.310 --> 04:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
we are agents of other landowners
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:51.430 --> 04:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
without including agents in this
 
04:58:54.070 --> 04:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
legislation we become very wary of
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
working anywhere on land where trails
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
currently the liability of someone
 
04:59:05.590 --> 04:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
else's reckless actions on one of these
 
04:59:08.550 --> 04:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
trails is simply too great
 
04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
where we could lose everything that
 
04:59:13.510 --> 04:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
we've worked so hard to build
 
04:59:15.670 --> 04:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
this became clear to us
 
04:59:18.070 --> 04:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
when logging our own land when a pair of
 
04:59:20.470 --> 04:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
atv riders had an accident near a point
 
04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
in the trail where we had dragged some
 
04:59:25.110 --> 04:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
wood across our trail
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
although the trail was not ready the atv
 
04:59:30.150 --> 04:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
riders used this opportunity
 
04:59:32.470 --> 04:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
to sue our logging company
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
as the agent of the landowner
 
04:59:39.830 --> 04:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
rather than the llc who owned the land
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
this has definitely dampened our
 
04:59:43.830 --> 04:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm for keeping our land open for
 
04:59:43.840 --> 04:59:45.350 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm for keeping our land open for
recreation

04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
recreation
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
and it is having us question what our
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
exposure is when it comes to working on
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
our own land
 
04:59:55.350 --> 04:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
and on our client property
 
04:59:57.270 --> 04:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
we would love to continue to allow our
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
land to be open to everyone for people
 
05:00:02.230 --> 05:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
to enjoy and use responsibly and
 
05:00:02.240 --> 05:00:03.670 align:start position:0%
to enjoy and use responsibly and
respectfully

05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
05:00:06.550 --> 05:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
but we do have to weigh the risks
 
05:00:08.550 --> 05:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
i never wanted to be one of those
 
05:00:12.788 --> 05:00:12.798 align:start position:0%
landowners that closed our land off
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1579 and the addition of
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
representative gould's
 
05:00:20.628 --> 05:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
adding landowner agent to the duty of
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
care law will reduce the liability for
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
the landowners like us
 
05:00:28.470 --> 05:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
and the agents like us to put the
 
05:00:30.948 --> 05:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the activities on
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
these trails back on the people
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
using the trails
 
05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
actually i do have
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
if if you maybe you could answer the
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
question just to clarify the suit so uh
 
05:01:03.200 --> 05:01:03.990 align:start position:0%
question just to clarify the suit so uh
you're

05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're part of the company that's being
 
05:01:07.510 --> 05:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
sued in that example that was has been
 
05:01:07.520 --> 05:01:08.470 align:start position:0%
sued in that example that was has been
given

05:01:08.470 --> 05:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
given
 
05:01:10.628 --> 05:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
and so what what
 
05:01:12.550 --> 05:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
what what are the plaintiffs in that
 
05:01:15.430 --> 05:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
suit claiming that
 
05:01:16.628 --> 05:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
you the
 
05:01:19.590 --> 05:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
the company did wrong
 
05:01:19.600 --> 05:01:24.230 align:start position:0%
the company did wrong
um

05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:27.270 --> 05:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
i probably shouldn't discuss
 
05:01:29.110 --> 05:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
probably should not say
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:38.240 --> 05:01:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%

so

05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%

the majority of our statewide trail
 
05:02:57.990 --> 05:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
system occurs on private lands because
 
05:03:01.110 --> 05:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
of the generosity of so many land owners
 
05:03:02.708 --> 05:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
one of the major reasons landowners are
 
05:03:04.948 --> 05:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
willing to support public access
 
05:03:06.310 --> 05:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
on their properties is because of the
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
liability protections landowners have
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
with the existing duty of care
 
05:03:14.070 --> 05:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
and limited liability laws
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%

05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
concerns that are not expressly covered
 
05:03:42.788 --> 05:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
under the current duty of karen
 
05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%

and rsa 508 colon 14.
 
05:03:52.470 --> 05:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
specifically our concerns are related to
 
05:03:55.910 --> 05:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
the following situations and examples
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
landowner lease agreements with the
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
state for trail use
 
05:04:01.510 --> 05:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
railroad and utility property and
 
05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
right-of-ways designated for
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
recreational use
 
05:04:07.510 --> 05:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
trails located on state lands
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
and private landowners who also own a
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
business and allow trail use on their
 
05:04:11.040 --> 05:04:16.150 align:start position:0%
business and allow trail use on their
property

05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
so with that house bill 1579 has written
 
05:04:21.190 --> 05:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
includes changes to the charge
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
definition in rsa 212 colon 34 i a
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
that includes a lease of such land for
 
05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
said purposes to the state or any
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
political subdivision thereof shall not
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
be considered a charge
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
the bureau of trails has lease
 
05:04:37.270 --> 05:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
agreements with several large landowners
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
to allow recreational trail use on their
 
05:04:41.200 --> 05:04:42.390 align:start position:0%
to allow recreational trail use on their
properties

05:04:42.390 --> 05:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
properties
 
05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
we agree with this change to the
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
definition and as the duty of care
 
05:04:47.910 --> 05:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
protections will remain available to
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
those landowners who enter into lease
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
agreements with the bureau of trails
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
the house bill also as written includes
 
05:04:57.030 --> 05:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
several changes to include adding
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
railroad property railroad right-of-ways
 
05:05:01.270 --> 05:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
and corridors to which public access is
 
05:05:01.280 --> 05:05:02.390 align:start position:0%
and corridors to which public access is
permitted

05:05:02.390 --> 05:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
we agree with these changes to ensure
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
that railroad and utility quarters that
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
are designated for recreational use are
 
05:05:10.390 --> 05:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
protected by those duty of care laws and
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
remain open for future use
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
and then regarding amendments to the
 
05:05:17.590 --> 05:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh just as a general housekeeping
 
05:05:19.350 --> 05:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
measure we suggest modifying the
 
05:05:23.590 --> 05:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
landowner definition in rsa 212 colon 34
 
05:05:23.600 --> 05:05:24.948 align:start position:0%

ib

05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
ib
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
to include the state or any political
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
subdivision thereof
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's already used in the existing
 
05:05:32.470 --> 05:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
landowner liability limited statute of
 
05:05:35.830 --> 05:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
rsa 508 colon 14 this would ensure
 
05:05:38.868 --> 05:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
consistency between the statutes
 
05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
and then lastly landowners conducting
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
activities such as timber harvesting on
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
their own land are protected under the
 
05:05:45.750 --> 05:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
current law
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
however as you heard if the landowner is
 
05:05:48.788 --> 05:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
conducting those activities through a
 
05:05:50.948 --> 05:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
separate business they also own
 
05:05:53.270 --> 05:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
the business is not protected
 
05:05:55.350 --> 05:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
we also suggest modifying the landowner
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
definition to include any business owned
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
in whole or in part by the landowner as
 
05:06:02.390 --> 05:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
defined in this section
 
05:06:03.910 --> 05:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
05:06:06.150 --> 05:06:06.160 align:start position:0%

05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
firm here in concord
 
05:06:43.350 --> 05:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
i have the pleasure of serving as
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
council to the new hampshire timberland
 
05:06:47.590 --> 05:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
owners association um
 
05:06:50.550 --> 05:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say a couple of things
 
05:06:53.430 --> 05:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
first these statutes have been in place
 
05:06:56.550 --> 05:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
for one for 60 plus years another for 45
 
05:06:57.990 --> 05:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
plus years
 
05:06:59.350 --> 05:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
and they do
 
05:07:01.510 --> 05:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
what they should do they reward or
 
05:07:03.990 --> 05:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
immunize landowners from negligent in
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
exchange for their leaving all their
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
hard-earned property open to
 
05:07:10.550 --> 05:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
the public for recreational uses
 
05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:16.150 --> 05:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we fully support the rail trail
 
05:07:19.830 --> 05:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
extensions and the addition of the
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
utilities and the railroads because they
 
05:07:22.320 --> 05:07:23.350 align:start position:0%
utilities and the railroads because they
won't

05:07:23.350 --> 05:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
won't
 
05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
they won't basically open it up unless
 
05:07:27.030 --> 05:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
you have an express definition that
 
05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
immunizes them and that's
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
one of the purposes here and and the
 
05:07:34.948 --> 05:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
lease to the state has the same effect
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
with respect to adding the provision of
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
those providing services
 
05:07:41.670 --> 05:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
all we are suggesting here is that
 
05:07:43.510 --> 05:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
you've already the state has already
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
immunized the landowner
 
05:07:49.590 --> 05:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
and if the landowner goes out and
 
05:07:49.600 --> 05:07:50.628 align:start position:0%
and if the landowner goes out and
mows

05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
mows
 
05:07:52.788 --> 05:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
mows the field cuts his timber does it
 
05:07:55.270 --> 05:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
on his own the landowner's immunized
 
05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
if the landowner hires somebody to do it
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
that person becomes a landowner's agent
 
05:08:03.510 --> 05:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
that like that immunization should
 
05:08:06.550 --> 05:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
extend to the contractor as well
 
05:08:07.990 --> 05:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter if the contract is
 
05:08:09.510 --> 05:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
making some money on it the landowner is
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
paying the money that he's making that's
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
really irrelevant it's he's the
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
landowner's agent
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
and there should be
 
05:08:19.030 --> 05:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
no distinction between the two because
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
he's working for the protected landowner
 
05:08:22.080 --> 05:08:23.190 align:start position:0%
he's working for the protected landowner
and

05:08:23.190 --> 05:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
a couple other things
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
and these are important the term
 
05:08:28.390 --> 05:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
negligence has been
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
bandied about here quite a bit
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
the statutes immunize the landowner
 
05:08:38.310 --> 05:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
and we submit those working form from
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
simple negligence
 
05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
05:08:43.590 --> 05:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
the sort of duty of care where you have
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
to go out and you have to meticulously
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
walk your property make sure there's no
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
potholes make sure there's no rock sharp
 
05:08:50.948 --> 05:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
rocks all that
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
they don't have to do that in exchange
 
05:08:52.878 --> 05:08:53.750 align:start position:0%
they don't have to do that in exchange
for

05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:08:56.070 --> 05:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
opening up their land to the public yeah
 
05:08:57.990 --> 05:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's the quid pro quo and that
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
makes sense that's why they do it
 
05:09:00.638 --> 05:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
makes sense that's why they do it
um

05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
this would not extend
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
um that protection any further other
 
05:09:07.750 --> 05:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
than to the contractor working for the
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
landowner and it would only immunize
 
05:09:09.760 --> 05:09:10.628 align:start position:0%
landowner and it would only immunize
them

05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:09:10.638 --> 05:09:11.670 align:start position:0%
them
from

05:09:11.670 --> 05:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
sort of carelessness
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know failure to walk the land
 
05:09:17.750 --> 05:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
failure to inspect all that stuff
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's simple negligence
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
but it would not in any way alter the
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
rest of the statute which says if you're
 
05:09:26.868 --> 05:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
grossly negligent or if you act
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
unwantedly or maliciously or with an
 
05:09:31.350 --> 05:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
intentional disregard for others
 
05:09:33.430 --> 05:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes you're liable for that there were a
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
couple of examples out there that if
 
05:09:37.270 --> 05:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
that logger that was doing the work had
 
05:09:39.670 --> 05:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
cut a bunch of ruts in the past
 
05:09:42.070 --> 05:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
or if he'd strung a chain across without
 
05:09:44.310 --> 05:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
flags or if he hadn't put any signage up
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
that signaled people that he was working
 
05:09:47.590 --> 05:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
in the area
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
i submit that would be grossly negligent
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
because in that situation knowing the
 
05:09:54.868 --> 05:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
circumstances that demonstrates a
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
deliberate disregard
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:09:59.830 --> 05:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of others
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction here
 
05:10:01.680 --> 05:10:03.030 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction here
and

05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:05.110 --> 05:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
if you were to take that that situation
 
05:10:06.868 --> 05:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
where the logger had strung the chain or
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
the logger had put a bunch of deep ruts
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
in a snowmobile or got injured
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
if you went into court
 
05:10:15.270 --> 05:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
with this amendment and tried to get the
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
case dismissed
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't get dismissed
 
05:10:21.510 --> 05:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
the other side would say no that's gross
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
negligence you knew what you were doing
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
and you had a duty to at least
 
05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
in that situation
 
05:10:32.230 --> 05:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
respect the safety of others
 
05:10:33.910 --> 05:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between simple
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
negligence which is again inattention or
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
failure to inspect which every homeowner
 
05:10:43.350 --> 05:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
or property owner has that's what's
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
immunizing the statute here we're just
 
05:10:47.350 --> 05:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
talking about extending
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
that protection to the person working
 
05:10:52.550 --> 05:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
for the landowner
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
because that's the person indirectly
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
doing the work
 
05:10:55.840 --> 05:10:56.868 align:start position:0%
doing the work
and

05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:58.868 --> 05:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
that's the sole purpose of this
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
relatively minor amendment it's not it's
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
not a long slide not a slippery slope
 
05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
05:11:06.230 --> 05:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
expanding the
 
05:11:07.750 --> 05:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
or acknowledging the landowner's
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:12.628 --> 05:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
you have any questions
 
05:11:12.638 --> 05:11:15.990 align:start position:0%
you have any questions
questions

05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:17.670 --> 05:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:11:17.680 --> 05:11:19.990 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

05:11:19.990 --> 05:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:23.040 --> 05:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
just

05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:11:25.510 --> 05:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh we've heard testimony uh already
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
today that the standard of wanton and
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
willful or growth what we call gross
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
negligence which i understand is not a
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
term that's used in the courts but
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
is extremely difficult to prove
 
05:11:43.110 --> 05:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
and hardly ever successful
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
so doesn't this nearly
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
grant total immunity to all agents in
 
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
all situations where
 
05:11:53.510 --> 05:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
like my 27 acres are in current use
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
oh miss mike um
 
05:11:55.200 --> 05:11:56.070 align:start position:0%
oh miss mike um
no

05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:11:57.590 --> 05:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to make is a distinction
 
05:12:01.030 --> 05:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
between one malicious and intentional
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
conduct which is a very high standard
 
05:12:06.070 --> 05:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
but you can be grossly negligent if you
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a reckless disregard for
 
05:12:08.160 --> 05:12:09.030 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a reckless disregard for
others

05:12:09.030 --> 05:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
others
 
05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
and the example given if you string a
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
chain across a snowmobile trail or if
 
05:12:15.750 --> 05:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
you dig a hole
 
05:12:18.070 --> 05:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
deep in a snowmobile trail and don't put
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
any guards around it while you're doing
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
your logging work or if you drag and
 
05:12:25.750 --> 05:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
drag timber and cause deep ruts
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
i submit if i were arguing the case that
 
05:12:31.190 --> 05:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
your honor this is gross negligence this
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
isn't negligence
 
05:12:35.590 --> 05:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
because it's a reckless disregard for
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
others it's not the situation where a
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
landowner doesn't know about
 
05:12:39.600 --> 05:12:40.628 align:start position:0%
landowner doesn't know about
such

05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
such
 
05:12:42.230 --> 05:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
conditions on his property which is the
 
05:12:44.550 --> 05:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
statutes are aimed to protect
 
05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
but if you do something that's grossly
 
05:12:48.470 --> 05:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
negligent you wouldn't get immunized
 
05:12:52.708 --> 05:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:55.350 --> 05:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
if if i could just ask a question and
 
05:12:57.110 --> 05:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're running far behind and i don't
 
05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:13:01.830 --> 05:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:01.840 --> 05:13:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
this

05:13:03.510 --> 05:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:13:06.310 --> 05:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
does not change a property owner's
 
05:13:09.200 --> 05:13:10.390 align:start position:0%
does not change a property owner's
liability

05:13:10.390 --> 05:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
liability
 
05:13:13.030 --> 05:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:14.708 --> 05:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
it the
 
05:13:17.510 --> 05:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
right now the duty of care the immunity
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
provided the landowners
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
stays the same as it is
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
the as i understand it and
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
the only issue is whether or not we
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
extend that liability to agents of the
 
05:13:31.440 --> 05:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
extend that liability to agents of the
landowner

05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
05:13:33.360 --> 05:13:34.868 align:start position:0%
landowner
and

05:13:34.868 --> 05:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:34.878 --> 05:13:37.030 align:start position:0%
and
the

05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:39.990 --> 05:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we've given one example so far
 
05:13:43.270 --> 05:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
of someone who is an agent who has been
 
05:13:43.280 --> 05:13:44.550 align:start position:0%
of someone who is an agent who has been
sued

05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
sued
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if it isn't
 
05:13:49.990 --> 05:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
whether i think and this is the question
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the committee will have to
 
05:13:52.390 --> 05:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
05:13:55.990 --> 05:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
do we now give a blanket liability to
 
05:13:57.670 --> 05:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
every logger
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
every timber cutter
 
05:14:00.320 --> 05:14:01.510 align:start position:0%
every timber cutter
or

05:14:01.510 --> 05:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
do we address the example that you've
 
05:14:05.190 --> 05:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
provided today
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
and as may have already been suggested
 
05:14:10.150 --> 05:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
in the prior testimony and that is to
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
a landowner who is in
 
05:14:15.750 --> 05:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
operating on their own property if not
 
05:14:17.910 --> 05:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
in their own name in the name of some
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
other entity and extend that liability
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
to that other entity
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
without just giving a blanket liability
 
05:14:24.718 --> 05:14:25.670 align:start position:0%
without just giving a blanket liability
to

05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:14:28.470 --> 05:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
every logger because not every logger is
 
05:14:30.310 --> 05:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
as conscientious as those who belong to
 
05:14:33.990 --> 05:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
the timber owners association
 
05:14:36.070 --> 05:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's a thought um i i think it might
 
05:14:38.070 --> 05:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
be difficult to fashion uh what
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of ownership they need uh the
 
05:14:42.868 --> 05:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
devils and the details obviously but
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
i i frankly don't see a distinction
 
05:14:47.270 --> 05:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
between me hiring my brother to do it
 
05:14:48.708 --> 05:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
and i'm a part owner of my brother's
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
company or me hiring a quality logger
 
05:14:52.868 --> 05:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
from across the way who's going to be
 
05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
responsible and do it the same way
 
05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're both acting through me
 
05:14:58.788 --> 05:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
at my behest
 
05:15:02.708 --> 05:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
to basically maintain my property and i
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
as a landowner have an immunity and i
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
don't see why they shouldn't have the
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
same immunity just as long as they
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
aren't again it's not total immunity if
 
05:15:10.878 --> 05:15:11.670 align:start position:0%
aren't again it's not total immunity if
they're

05:15:11.670 --> 05:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:15:13.990 --> 05:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
out of line and grossly negligent uh
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing or disregarding
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
people statute won't help them
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:15:22.310 --> 05:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:35.110 --> 05:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is rob
 
05:15:38.390 --> 05:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
johnson and i appear before you
 
05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire farm
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
bureau as a federation's policy director
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
farm bureau is an organization made up
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
of just under 2 000 family memberships
 
05:15:49.350 --> 05:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
farm memberships and another 1 000 or so
 
05:15:50.708 --> 05:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
there are other types of supporting
 
05:15:50.718 --> 05:15:51.830 align:start position:0%
there are other types of supporting
members

05:15:51.830 --> 05:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:15:51.840 --> 05:15:53.350 align:start position:0%
members
and

05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair your the question you just
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
asked is it hits it right on is we
 
05:15:58.718 --> 05:15:59.750 align:start position:0%
asked is it hits it right on is we
um

05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:01.110 --> 05:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
we're in support and i'm speaking to the
 
05:16:01.120 --> 05:16:02.230 align:start position:0%
we're in support and i'm speaking to the
amendment

05:16:02.230 --> 05:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:16:02.240 --> 05:16:03.510 align:start position:0%
amendment
and

05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:05.190 --> 05:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
just hearing the discussion i think we
 
05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
understood the amendment to be a little
 
05:16:09.030 --> 05:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
more narrowly drawn than i think some
 
05:16:09.040 --> 05:16:10.230 align:start position:0%
more narrowly drawn than i think some
have

05:16:10.230 --> 05:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:16:10.240 --> 05:16:11.190 align:start position:0%
have
that

05:16:11.190 --> 05:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
are concerned and when we first heard
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
about this case that really caught our
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
attention and found it very chilling
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
a number of our members provide
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
a portion of their property for the
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
statewide trail system and maybe
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
everybody doesn't understand what that
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
is but it's basically the state
 
05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trail system
 
05:16:34.628 --> 05:16:34.638 align:start position:0%
and it's not a the state doesn't have on
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
i my family has a trail statewide trail
 
05:16:40.150 --> 05:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
system on his property and the state
 
05:16:42.150 --> 05:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a right-of-way the state
 
05:16:44.070 --> 05:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an easement it's just an
 
05:16:46.070 --> 05:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
agreement that i have with my local
 
05:16:47.670 --> 05:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
snowmobile club
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
for the use of that
 
05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
that trail and that's the piece that the
 
05:16:53.670 --> 05:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
the my understanding has always been our
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
understanding has always been that the
 
05:16:58.230 --> 05:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
the uh liability coverage that the state
 
05:17:01.350 --> 05:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
provides covers the trail itself
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
technically if somebody goes off the
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
trail doesn't cover it but that's what
 
05:17:06.470 --> 05:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're asking this extended coverage for
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
the land not in atlanta but the agent on
 
05:17:11.670 --> 05:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
that porsche on the trail itself that is
 
05:17:13.270 --> 05:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
part of the statewide trail system i
 
05:17:15.190 --> 05:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
think mr chin maybe i misunderstood but
 
05:17:17.350 --> 05:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's your question was getting at
 
05:17:17.360 --> 05:17:20.628 align:start position:0%
that's your question was getting at
um

05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:23.030 --> 05:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
as has been mentioned earlier you know a
 
05:17:24.470 --> 05:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the statewide trail
 
05:17:26.310 --> 05:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
system is on private property and again
 
05:17:27.670 --> 05:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'll repeat the state doesn't have a
 
05:17:29.110 --> 05:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
right of way it doesn't have an easement
 
05:17:30.310 --> 05:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
us as landowners
 
05:17:33.990 --> 05:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
agreeing to sit working with the clubs
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
to provide these recreational
 
05:17:37.910 --> 05:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities which we want to do
 
05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of the discussion today is talked
 
05:17:40.948 --> 05:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
about logging
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
well many of our farms are organized
 
05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's limited liability companies in
 
05:17:47.670 --> 05:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
other and the the
 
05:17:47.680 --> 05:17:48.868 align:start position:0%
other and the the
the

05:17:48.868 --> 05:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:51.350 --> 05:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
paths or the roads that we allow
 
05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
the public to use on for this trail
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
system are the roads that we travel with
 
05:17:57.990 --> 05:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
our tractors our farm equipment our
 
05:17:58.000 --> 05:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
our tractors our farm equipment our
cattle

05:17:59.110 --> 05:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
cattle
 
05:18:01.030 --> 05:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
and and that's the concern we have is
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
that with this has there been a loophole
 
05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
and we really believe that the the state
 
05:18:08.310 --> 05:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
has an obligation if we're providing the
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
service of this public recreation to
 
05:18:11.590 --> 05:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
yeah the the the the case pace may be
 
05:18:16.948 --> 05:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
frivolous may not be going anywhere
 
05:18:16.958 --> 05:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
frivolous may not be going anywhere
but

05:18:17.750 --> 05:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:18:19.750 --> 05:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
as you all know you can sue some anybody
 
05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
for anything and it's just the the time
 
05:18:25.510 --> 05:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
in the cost of having to defend yourself
 
05:18:26.948 --> 05:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave it at that mr chair and
 
05:18:31.030 --> 05:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
05:18:35.670 --> 05:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:18:37.350 --> 05:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
we do have four more people who wish to
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
testify on uh they've all asked for uh
 
05:18:42.470 --> 05:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
short periods of time and
 
05:18:44.830 --> 05:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
yeah call upon them if they could be as
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
concise given that we've had lots of
 
05:18:48.708 --> 05:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
evidence so far
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
the jason
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:06.868 --> 05:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
no you gotta press the button right
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
there you go sit on now yep great uh
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
jason sukup i from manchester massar new
 
05:19:14.788 --> 05:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire i represent a trail
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
development organization called
 
05:19:19.350 --> 05:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
manchester moves we've been around since
 
05:19:19.360 --> 05:19:21.590 align:start position:0%
manchester moves we've been around since
2008.

05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
2008.
 
05:19:24.628 --> 05:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
we've been working hard to develop a
 
05:19:26.788 --> 05:19:26.798 align:start position:0%
comprehensive rail trail network in the
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:32.070 --> 05:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
the reason it's important for this group
 
05:19:33.750 --> 05:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
to hear the work that we've been doing
 
05:19:35.030 --> 05:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
is because the work that we've been
 
05:19:37.750 --> 05:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
doing i think spurred this bill
 
05:19:40.230 --> 05:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
it spurred this bill because we are very
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
close to having a statewide rail trail
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
called the granite state rail trail it's
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
a nearly contiguous 125 mile
 
05:19:50.550 --> 05:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
recreational rail trail that spans from
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
lebanon to salem
 
05:19:54.070 --> 05:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
and right now it's got what we call the
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
big problem or the big gap between
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
manchester and concord
 
05:19:59.830 --> 05:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
and that's where the people live
 
05:20:01.750 --> 05:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's been easy to develop all the rail
 
05:20:03.910 --> 05:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
trails on the abandoned lines because
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
they've been abandoned
 
05:20:08.230 --> 05:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
and so those are developed and so
 
05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
they're good but they don't go anywhere
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
other states like new york just
 
05:20:15.910 --> 05:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
completed their 400 and some mile empire
 
05:20:17.590 --> 05:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
state rail trail
 
05:20:20.470 --> 05:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
ohio has a statewide trail
 
05:20:22.550 --> 05:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's a trail that's going up the east
 
05:20:25.510 --> 05:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
coast the east coast greenway that goes
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
all the way from
 
05:20:28.470 --> 05:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
florida to maine
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
the attraction of these trails is the
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
connectivity to the extent that they gap
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
they're not nearly as useful or
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
attractive or interesting to visit as a
 
05:20:40.628 --> 05:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
as a tourist destination
 
05:20:42.470 --> 05:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity in front of us to
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
close the gap between manchester and
 
05:20:44.958 --> 05:20:46.070 align:start position:0%
close the gap between manchester and
concord

05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
concord
 
05:20:48.070 --> 05:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
along the merrimack river from the
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
manchester mill yard up to concord an
 
05:20:52.868 --> 05:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
area that's a freight line has been a
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
freight line for a long time
 
05:20:57.910 --> 05:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
very rarely used land it runs coal
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
cement heavy things that do need to run
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
through there
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
by the way that's not an area that is
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
proposed for the capital corridor
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
commuter line which is going to
 
05:21:08.788 --> 05:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
terminate in downtown manchester
 
05:21:10.868 --> 05:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
this area is going to be freight for the
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
for foreseeable future
 
05:21:15.270 --> 05:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
that rail line has been sold it's
 
05:21:17.430 --> 05:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
currently under agreement with csx
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%

we've been in interest-based dialogue

hampshire
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
we have had the dialogue
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
and expressed the opportunity that we
 
05:21:50.470 --> 05:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
have as a state
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire d.o.t will build a rail
 
05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
with trail they have the capabilities
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
and the safety standards to do so they
 
05:21:59.750 --> 05:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
can only do so with the express
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
permission of the landowner to date pan
 
05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%

05:22:04.958 --> 05:22:06.548 align:start position:0%
am has always said no the reason is
liability

05:22:06.548 --> 05:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
liability
 
05:22:08.470 --> 05:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
they don't want the liability
 
05:22:08.480 --> 05:22:09.510 align:start position:0%
they don't want the liability
concern

05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:22:12.230 --> 05:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
csx a national rail operator has done
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
these things before and they've done
 
05:22:15.830 --> 05:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
them in other states and they've said
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
that they would do them here if there
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
was a law on the books that was
 
05:22:21.030 --> 05:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
comparable to the neighboring states
 
05:22:24.070 --> 05:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
like maine and vermont this law sought
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
to replicate those laws
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
this didn't originate as a
 
05:22:30.240 --> 05:22:31.350 align:start position:0%
this didn't originate as a
well

05:22:31.350 --> 05:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:22:33.590 --> 05:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
this this originated
 
05:22:36.628 --> 05:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
because it would protect the railroad
 
05:22:38.708 --> 05:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
and the laws that are on the books
 
05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
already protect the land we were told
 
05:22:41.670 --> 05:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
that early on
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
but by defining the railroad
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
specifically in the law as well
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
that gave them comfort to give us the
 
05:22:50.948 --> 05:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
ability to complete the trail
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
they've asked for the law they've said
 
05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
if if we had the law similar to other
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
states we could do the same so that's
 
05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity that's what we hope to
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
see so
 
05:23:02.788 --> 05:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
if we had this law
 
05:23:04.948 --> 05:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
i think we would also get a statewide
 
05:23:07.350 --> 05:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
rail trail within the next few years i
 
05:23:09.750 --> 05:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
ask you to support this law
 
05:23:11.270 --> 05:23:11.280 align:start position:0%

i am in support of house bill 1579 and
 
05:25:22.390 --> 05:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
the addition of landowner agents to the
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
duty of care law
 
05:25:26.948 --> 05:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
managing recreational use and protecting
 
05:25:28.390 --> 05:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
our landowner clients as well as
 
05:25:30.150 --> 05:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
ourselves as agents
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
is becoming very difficult and costly
 
05:25:35.670 --> 05:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
we have seen an increase year after year
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
for the past two decades in all forms of
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation on our lands
 
05:25:42.390 --> 05:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
and during the pandemic
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
private landowners have seen
 
05:25:48.070 --> 05:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
a dramatic rise in this use
 
05:25:49.990 --> 05:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
as a result i found myself spending much
 
05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
more time trying to increase awareness
 
05:25:54.230 --> 05:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
to the public of our forest management
 
05:25:54.240 --> 05:25:55.510 align:start position:0%

activities
 
05:25:57.350 --> 05:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
i have leaned heavily on the
 
05:25:59.990 --> 05:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
ever-shrinking number of volunteers from
 
05:26:02.470 --> 05:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
local clubs to help with safety
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
awareness and posting signs where
 
05:26:04.160 --> 05:26:06.230 align:start position:0%
awareness and posting signs where
appropriate

05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
managing these private lands as working
 
05:26:10.310 --> 05:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
forest is vital to the economic
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
sustainability of property ownership in
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
our state
 
05:26:16.150 --> 05:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
adding landowner agents such as
 
05:26:16.160 --> 05:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
adding landowner agents such as
foresters

05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
foresters
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
loggers and truckers
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
to the duty of care law protects
 
05:26:24.390 --> 05:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
companies such as wagner
 
05:26:26.548 --> 05:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
who make property ownership viable in
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and that's i wanted to
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
just touch upon the kind of link
 
05:26:34.070 --> 05:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
wagner represents
 
05:26:36.628 --> 05:26:36.638 align:start position:0%
well we manage 150 000 acres in our
 
05:26:36.638 --> 05:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
well we manage 150 000 acres in our
state

05:26:37.750 --> 05:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
mainly for absentee landowners so they
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
hire us as an agent
 
05:26:44.548 --> 05:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
to carry out the forest management
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
activities on their property we then
 
05:26:49.350 --> 05:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
also contract out to logging companies
 
05:26:51.270 --> 05:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
and trucking companies to haul those
 
05:26:53.670 --> 05:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
forest products to the mill
 
05:26:55.350 --> 05:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
so it is important to
 
05:26:58.868 --> 05:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
not so much
 
05:27:02.390 --> 05:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
just include the logging companies as
 
05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
much as it would be the forest
 
05:27:07.590 --> 05:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:07.600 --> 05:27:08.708 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's why i support house bill 1579.

with manchester moves and as he
mentioned

05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
05:27:47.590 --> 05:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
succinctly the initial
 
05:27:50.310 --> 05:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
drive behind wanting to get this law in
 
05:27:50.320 --> 05:27:51.270 align:start position:0%
drive behind wanting to get this law in
place

05:27:51.270 --> 05:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:27:54.150 --> 05:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
was the completion of the trail and the
 
05:27:56.470 --> 05:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
significant quarter that is
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
has a big gap and we want to see that
 
05:28:00.150 --> 05:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
gap closed
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know in today's litigious society
 
05:28:03.750 --> 05:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
private land owners and public land
 
05:28:05.590 --> 05:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
managers must concern themselves with
 
05:28:07.430 --> 05:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
issues of liability
 
05:28:09.990 --> 05:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
the fear of a lawsuit is often enough to
 
05:28:11.910 --> 05:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
prevent private land owners from opening
 
05:28:13.350 --> 05:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
the land
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
for recreational use even though they
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
would like to share their land with the
 
05:28:16.878 --> 05:28:19.030 align:start position:0%
would like to share their land with the
public

05:28:19.030 --> 05:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
public land
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
land managers must also deal with the
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
issue of liability
 
05:28:26.150 --> 05:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
and private landowners
 
05:28:27.910 --> 05:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
and managers
 
05:28:27.920 --> 05:28:28.868 align:start position:0%
and managers
may

05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
and have
 
05:28:30.638 --> 05:28:31.590 align:start position:0%
and have
used

05:28:31.590 --> 05:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:28:33.430 --> 05:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
the issue of liability
 
05:28:36.788 --> 05:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
as a reason to close off public access
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
to land
 
05:28:40.470 --> 05:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
i'm also
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
coming as a private individual
 
05:28:45.270 --> 05:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
who wants to see
 
05:28:45.280 --> 05:28:46.150 align:start position:0%
who wants to see
people

05:28:46.150 --> 05:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:28:48.390 --> 05:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
and our community as a whole
 
05:28:50.310 --> 05:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
move towards health i work in the elite
 
05:28:52.628 --> 05:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
hospitals as a nurse in the emergency
 
05:28:52.638 --> 05:28:53.670 align:start position:0%
hospitals as a nurse in the emergency
department

05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we see over and over
 
05:28:58.390 --> 05:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
people coming in
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
because of long-standing health issues
 
05:29:00.718 --> 05:29:01.510 align:start position:0%
because of long-standing health issues
and

05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:03.270 --> 05:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
though we can address that in a clinical
 
05:29:03.280 --> 05:29:04.150 align:start position:0%
though we can address that in a clinical
setting

05:29:04.150 --> 05:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
setting
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
our goal would be to move towards
 
05:29:07.910 --> 05:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
getting people outdoors active and
 
05:29:09.350 --> 05:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
healthy addressing both physical and
 
05:29:11.590 --> 05:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
the slippery slope that was mentioned we
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
05:29:15.990 --> 05:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
prior to working in the emergency
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
department i've worked in the outdoor
 
05:29:17.200 --> 05:29:18.708 align:start position:0%
department i've worked in the outdoor
industry

05:29:18.708 --> 05:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
industry
 
05:29:20.548 --> 05:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
in youth programs
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
taking kids outside and we've seen
 
05:29:26.070 --> 05:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
over the last 15 years
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
greater and greater restrictions on
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
where and how we can take people outside
 
05:29:32.708 --> 05:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
and encourage people to go outside
 
05:29:34.628 --> 05:29:34.638 align:start position:0%
because of liability
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
there was an argument made conflating
 
05:29:39.430 --> 05:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation
 
05:29:41.270 --> 05:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
and a roller coaster
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
in section c it out it defines outdoor
 
05:29:44.638 --> 05:29:45.830 align:start position:0%
in section c it out it defines outdoor
recreation

05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
recreation
 
05:29:48.150 --> 05:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
and though we could spend
 
05:29:50.708 --> 05:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
all of our time trying to specifically
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
name each activity i believe the spirit
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
of the law is clear there
 
05:29:57.270 --> 05:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
that outdoor recreation
 
05:29:59.990 --> 05:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
does not is not a roller coaster
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
and again as somebody else mentioned the
 
05:30:04.628 --> 05:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
idea of liability
 
05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
for somebody putting a chain across the
 
05:30:06.638 --> 05:30:08.628 align:start position:0%
for somebody putting a chain across the
road

05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
road
 
05:30:10.708 --> 05:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
again do we want to enumerate every
 
05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
little piece that they can and can't do
 
05:30:16.150 --> 05:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
or do we want to have
 
05:30:17.270 --> 05:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
a law
 
05:30:20.310 --> 05:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
that in general protects the landowner
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there may be other
 
05:30:23.700 --> 05:30:23.710 align:start position:0%
times that we want to
 
05:30:23.710 --> 05:30:25.110 align:start position:0%
times that we want to
[Music]

05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
hold them liable for activities that
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
appear to be negligent
 
05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not a liar and i don't know the
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
exact verbiage and case law that has
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
been asked for there appears to be a
 
05:30:35.670 --> 05:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
general consensus
 
05:30:37.590 --> 05:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:30:37.600 --> 05:30:38.470 align:start position:0%
for the
uh

05:30:38.470 --> 05:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
support of the law for the
 
05:30:43.990 --> 05:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
rail trail and i would also ask that we
 
05:30:44.000 --> 05:30:45.190 align:start position:0%
rail trail and i would also ask that we
consider

05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:30:48.070 --> 05:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
other uses like the farms and the timber
 
05:30:50.150 --> 05:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
industry because that is in the same
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
spirit of the law keeping land open for
 
05:30:55.590 --> 05:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
the public for recreation
 
05:30:57.670 --> 05:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
recreational use in a way that promotes
 
05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
public health community
 
05:31:02.070 --> 05:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
and allows there not to be a divide
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
between those who have land and own it
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
and are able to use it and those who
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
don't have access to that kind of land
 
05:31:11.350 --> 05:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
so i i respectfully ask that we
 
05:31:13.910 --> 05:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
move forward and support
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
the both the bill original and the
 
05:31:16.320 --> 05:31:17.350 align:start position:0%

to the amendment having not had the
 
05:31:47.430 --> 05:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to adequately review it
 
05:31:49.110 --> 05:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
i'm the president of lime properties a
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
real estate development company based in
 
05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
west lebanon new hampshire where we are
 
05:31:54.390 --> 05:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
helping to revitalize our downtown and
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
building a mixed-use trail and
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
transit-oriented development at river
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
park west lebanon
 
05:32:01.510 --> 05:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
we own and are developing that 38 acre
 
05:32:03.030 --> 05:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
parcel we have proactively and
 
05:32:04.788 --> 05:32:04.798 align:start position:0%
voluntarily facilitated publicly
 
05:32:06.548 --> 05:32:06.558 align:start position:0%
accessible trails
 
05:32:08.390 --> 05:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
we are one piece of a larger effort and
 
05:32:10.628 --> 05:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
as mentioned in earlier testimony as a
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
landowner we appreciate the protections
 
05:32:14.548 --> 05:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
of the current recreational use statute
 
05:32:16.070 --> 05:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
but trail networks are often about
 
05:32:18.150 --> 05:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
connecting pieces of a puzzle and when
 
05:32:19.990 --> 05:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
critical puzzle pieces won't participate
 
05:32:22.150 --> 05:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
because of perceived liability
 
05:32:23.590 --> 05:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
well anyone who's worked hard on a
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
puzzle only discover a missing piece
 
05:32:27.670 --> 05:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
knows how frustrating that can be
 
05:32:29.270 --> 05:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm an environmentalist a hunter and a
 
05:32:31.190 --> 05:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
fisherman and thusly a river and trail
 
05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
advocate i'm also a member of our
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
downtown revitalization committee where
 
05:32:36.628 --> 05:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
we're working to with a growing
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
coalition to expand the popular trail
 
05:32:41.190 --> 05:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
network through downtown west lebanon
 
05:32:43.350 --> 05:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
this statute as informed by similar laws
 
05:32:45.030 --> 05:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in neighboring states will
 
05:32:47.590 --> 05:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
assist in overcoming key barriers
 
05:32:50.310 --> 05:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:51.750 --> 05:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
as has been proven
 
05:32:53.430 --> 05:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and nationwide trails
 
05:32:55.110 --> 05:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
are a transformative force for improving
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
outdoor access for residents and
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
attracting tourism their mechanisms for
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
positive change provide alternative
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
transportation opportunities and are
 
05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
drivers of economic development and
 
05:33:06.070 --> 05:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
equitable access to the outdoors
 
05:33:07.510 --> 05:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
this bill supports the expansion and
 
05:33:08.948 --> 05:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
connection of these trail corridors in
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
west lebanon
 
05:33:12.310 --> 05:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
this past november governor sununu came
 
05:33:13.670 --> 05:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
to help demolish the dilapidated
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
remnants of the westboro railyard this
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
demolition is symbolic of existing chain
 
05:33:19.750 --> 05:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
of exciting change to come and a
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
critical step down the path to west
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
lebanon's economic recovery
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
building upon that progress that the new
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislature put in motion
 
05:33:28.390 --> 05:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
last night we presented the left to the
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
lebanon city council our action plan for
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
west suburban revitalization
 
05:33:34.390 --> 05:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
central to that effort is reconnecting
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
our community to the river by using
 
05:33:38.310 --> 05:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
trails trails that will be assisted by
 
05:33:40.390 --> 05:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
this bill to tie together historic
 
05:33:42.150 --> 05:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods new development and
 
05:33:44.230 --> 05:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
recreation areas
 
05:33:45.990 --> 05:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
it allows the city of lebanon the new
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of transportation
 
05:33:49.590 --> 05:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
and the rail operator to reach
 
05:33:51.270 --> 05:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
collaborative solutions to finally
 
05:33:53.270 --> 05:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
achieve trail connections that complete
 
05:33:54.548 --> 05:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
trails that citizens have been
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
requesting for decades i thank the
 
05:33:58.948 --> 05:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
bipartisan sponsors of this bill believe
 
05:34:00.230 --> 05:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
it speaks to the broad support for
 
05:34:01.590 --> 05:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
expanding trails and access in new
 
05:34:01.600 --> 05:34:02.548 align:start position:0%
expanding trails and access in new
hampshire

05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
and believe that a recreational use
 
05:34:05.990 --> 05:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
statute allows commerce and recreation
 
05:34:07.990 --> 05:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
to co-exist and in doing so creates
 
05:34:09.350 --> 05:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
symbiotic value for new hampshire
 
05:34:10.948 --> 05:34:10.958 align:start position:0%

05:34:38.948 --> 05:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon members of the
 
05:34:40.628 --> 05:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for allowing me to
 
05:34:42.788 --> 05:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
speak i will be brief um hopefully under
 
05:34:44.230 --> 05:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
05:34:46.230 --> 05:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
um a couple thoughts i just wanted to
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
share with the community for the record
 
05:34:49.270 --> 05:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
my name is marissa chase i represent the
 
05:34:50.868 --> 05:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association for justice
 
05:34:52.230 --> 05:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
which is a statewide professional
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
associate trade association of
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 trial attorneys
 
05:35:00.548 --> 05:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
and we opposed hb 1579 as introduced and
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
we absolutely oppose the amendment that
 
05:35:05.590 --> 05:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
was introduced to us today
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
i think we all we all support
 
05:35:08.878 --> 05:35:10.150 align:start position:0%
i think we all we all support
the

05:35:10.150 --> 05:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:11.990 --> 05:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the spirit of what we're trying to
 
05:35:13.590 --> 05:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
protect i don't think anybody in this
 
05:35:15.350 --> 05:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
room doesn't but i think there is a
 
05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
fundamental lack of understanding about
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
how claims are brought in new hampshire
 
05:35:23.110 --> 05:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
our existing statutory and
 
05:35:24.868 --> 05:35:24.878 align:start position:0%
common law framework because how
 
05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
statutes get interpreted by the courts
 
05:35:29.110 --> 05:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
is how they are applied to cases brought
 
05:35:31.030 --> 05:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
before them
 
05:35:33.030 --> 05:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire law like gross
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
negligence is in statutes all across our
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
rsas it has nev our supreme court has
 
05:35:37.760 --> 05:35:38.628 align:start position:0%
rsas it has nev our supreme court has
never

05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
never
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted degrees of negligence in the
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
civil um
 
05:35:44.708 --> 05:35:44.718 align:start position:0%
in the civil justice system in new
 
05:35:46.708 --> 05:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire so there is no such
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
recognition for what gross negligence
 
05:35:51.830 --> 05:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be right now that chain across
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
a trail that was mentioned that is
 
05:35:57.270 --> 05:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
simple negligence right now in practice
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to talk further about that
 
05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
another time when i'm not
 
05:36:04.230 --> 05:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
already so over the amount for the um
 
05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
that you've allotted for this hearing
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that everybody
 
05:36:09.670 --> 05:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
reads the case dolber v city of laconia
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
that mr woodbury mentioned earlier again
 
05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
that already covers the concern that
 
05:36:16.708 --> 05:36:16.718 align:start position:0%
rail trail folks have
 
05:36:18.470 --> 05:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a preceding case to that
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
called cohen c-o-e-n i will send those
 
05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
05:36:22.400 --> 05:36:23.910 align:start position:0%
to the committee
um

05:36:23.910 --> 05:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:26.070 --> 05:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
the state already has sovereign immunity
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
by statute and case law
 
05:36:31.110 --> 05:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh that has largely been extended to
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities especially for
 
05:36:34.470 --> 05:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
recreational use
 
05:36:37.030 --> 05:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
um to fix one lawsuit that was filed
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
that i understand we don't know the
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
details of this would have
 
05:36:44.470 --> 05:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
limit unlimited unintended consequences
 
05:36:46.548 --> 05:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
and i would also point out to the
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
um for that's to the amendment
 
05:36:51.910 --> 05:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
it also say as drafted in the amendment
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
anyone who is hired to conduct work on
 
05:36:58.230 --> 05:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
land would be covered that could be gas
 
05:36:59.910 --> 05:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
it could be electrical it could be pest
 
05:37:02.070 --> 05:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
control which deals with chemicals
 
05:37:02.080 --> 05:37:03.270 align:start position:0%
control which deals with chemicals
um

05:37:03.270 --> 05:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
and those
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
professions are require special
 
05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
certification of licensure and are
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
governed by specific standards of care
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
in other statutes
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
the last thing i will say is the bill as
 
05:37:15.600 --> 05:37:16.390 align:start position:0%
the last thing i will say is the bill as
um

05:37:16.390 --> 05:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
the original bill house bill 1579 again
 
05:37:20.868 --> 05:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
no doubt it's well intentioned
 
05:37:20.878 --> 05:37:21.830 align:start position:0%
no doubt it's well intentioned
um

05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:23.190 --> 05:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear that i heard that there
 
05:37:26.470 --> 05:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
were assurances from csx but
 
05:37:27.910 --> 05:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
any assurances made by utilities like
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
eversource that owns public
 
05:37:31.200 --> 05:37:33.750 align:start position:0%
eversource that owns public
right-of-ways

05:37:33.750 --> 05:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
right-of-ways
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
that there are any assurances that if
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
this bill passed
 
05:37:38.868 --> 05:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
new trails could be built on those other
 
05:37:41.270 --> 05:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
entities that are outlined in the
 
05:37:43.590 --> 05:37:43.600 align:start position:0%

practices
 
05:40:24.558 --> 05:40:26.788 align:start position:0%
practices
from

05:40:26.788 --> 05:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:40:28.948 --> 05:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
abuse of
 
05:40:28.958 --> 05:40:29.910 align:start position:0%
abuse of
local

05:40:29.910 --> 05:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:40:29.920 --> 05:40:31.350 align:start position:0%
local
ordinances

05:40:31.350 --> 05:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
particularly land use ordinances
 
05:40:36.310 --> 05:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:40:37.990 --> 05:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'll just tell you two quick
 
05:40:38.000 --> 05:40:39.270 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'll just tell you two quick
stories

05:40:39.270 --> 05:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
stories
 
05:40:42.150 --> 05:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
well one may not quite so but anyway so
 
05:40:44.948 --> 05:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
there was a church it was in durham
 
05:40:49.750 --> 05:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
and it wanted to expand from the center
 
05:40:52.628 --> 05:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
of town to outside town
 
05:40:54.470 --> 05:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
and to make a very long story short the
 
05:40:56.150 --> 05:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
long stories it took me three and a half
 
05:40:56.160 --> 05:40:57.110 align:start position:0%
long stories it took me three and a half
years

05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:41:00.548 --> 05:41:00.558 align:start position:0%
to be able to relocate
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
because of
 
05:41:04.708 --> 05:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
what i want to call obstruction
 
05:41:06.708 --> 05:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
by the local
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
land use boards
 
05:41:11.830 --> 05:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
so that wasn't that big a deal to me at
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
that time
 
05:41:15.990 --> 05:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
but since then i've heard of other
 
05:41:19.270 --> 05:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
situations uh and more egregious if you
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
will situations than that and what my
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
testimony today is going to consist of
 
05:41:23.040 --> 05:41:24.708 align:start position:0%
testimony today is going to consist of
one

05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:41:26.548 --> 05:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
that has occurred in the town but is
 
05:41:26.558 --> 05:41:28.390 align:start position:0%
that has occurred in the town but is
ongoing

05:41:28.390 --> 05:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
05:41:32.548 --> 05:41:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:32.558 --> 05:41:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:41:39.910 --> 05:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:39.920 --> 05:41:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:43.190 --> 05:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's a hound there's a family
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
that owns a house and they have prayer
 
05:41:47.670 --> 05:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
meetings at their house
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
and they're being told that they can't
 
05:41:51.350 --> 05:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
do that anymore
 
05:41:51.360 --> 05:41:52.788 align:start position:0%
do that anymore
because

05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:58.948 --> 05:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
that's it they have like five or six
 
05:42:00.070 --> 05:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
people come to the house for prayer
 
05:42:01.910 --> 05:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
meeting and the town
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
is trying to tell them that they cannot
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
do that
 
05:42:06.628 --> 05:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
because they have now
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
changed the use of their home
 
05:42:12.070 --> 05:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
from residential to some sort of
 
05:42:12.080 --> 05:42:14.708 align:start position:0%
from residential to some sort of
commercial

05:42:14.708 --> 05:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:16.868 --> 05:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
i kid you not
 
05:42:21.030 --> 05:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:23.510 --> 05:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
we have seen
 
05:42:24.868 --> 05:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
i was going to read a different email
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
than the one i'm looking at now so i'm
 
05:42:27.750 --> 05:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
not going to read you the actual story
 
05:42:29.350 --> 05:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
of that but that's the gist of it right
 
05:42:29.360 --> 05:42:30.390 align:start position:0%
of that but that's the gist of it right
there

05:42:30.390 --> 05:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:42:33.030 --> 05:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have seen other cases
 
05:42:36.708 --> 05:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
where churches have wanted to relocate
 
05:42:39.030 --> 05:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
into commercial zones
 
05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
and required to have excessive amounts
 
05:42:42.470 --> 05:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
of parking
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
or other accesses a lot of of things
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
have been used
 
05:42:52.150 --> 05:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
to prohibit that kind of
 
05:42:52.160 --> 05:42:53.350 align:start position:0%
to prohibit that kind of
movement

05:42:53.350 --> 05:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
movement
 
05:42:55.270 --> 05:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
and establishment of new churches and
 
05:42:59.190 --> 05:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:01.350 --> 05:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
because the fact that when a church
 
05:43:04.390 --> 05:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
takes over a property it becomes
 
05:43:06.230 --> 05:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
non-taxable so if you move into a
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
commercial zone you're taking a valuable
 
05:43:09.670 --> 05:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
piece of property up to tax rolls and so
 
05:43:11.670 --> 05:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
they don't want you to do it
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
so we have anti-discrimination law
 
05:43:15.590 --> 05:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
against religion
 
05:43:17.590 --> 05:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
but we haven't really got any way of
 
05:43:17.600 --> 05:43:19.190 align:start position:0%
but we haven't really got any way of
protecting

05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
05:43:20.788 --> 05:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
the churches themselves and the people
 
05:43:24.070 --> 05:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
wanting to found them or or whatever
 
05:43:25.990 --> 05:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
or practice religion in their homes and
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
so that's what this bill is for
 
05:43:30.470 --> 05:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
i'll take you a few questions
 
05:43:32.638 --> 05:43:36.788 align:start position:0%
i'll take you a few questions
questions

05:43:36.788 --> 05:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:40.868 --> 05:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:44.070 --> 05:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
my first question is this um are you
 
05:43:45.430 --> 05:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
referring to the
 
05:43:47.190 --> 05:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
evangelical church of durham which is
 
05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
located on dover road um you know like
 
05:43:52.868 --> 05:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
about half a mile north of route four
 
05:43:55.590 --> 05:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes okay good tip
 
05:43:55.600 --> 05:43:57.030 align:start position:0%
uh yes okay good tip
now

05:43:57.030 --> 05:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
just for the uh just for information for
 
05:44:00.150 --> 05:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
that controversy happened during a
 
05:44:01.350 --> 05:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
period of time when i was actually
 
05:44:04.150 --> 05:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
living in the upper valley so um
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
churches church is thriving in its
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
location it certainly is
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
i've got a more philosophical question
 
05:44:12.150 --> 05:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:44:13.830 --> 05:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
and why
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
should churches get special uh
 
05:44:17.350 --> 05:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
consideration especially given that they
 
05:44:19.110 --> 05:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
don't pay taxes you know like somebody
 
05:44:20.230 --> 05:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
else has to
 
05:44:22.150 --> 05:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
pick up the slack you know the
 
05:44:23.830 --> 05:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
commercial enterprises the homeowners
 
05:44:25.590 --> 05:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
have to pick up the slack for them so
 
05:44:28.310 --> 05:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
like why there's only two reasons
 
05:44:29.670 --> 05:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
one is there's a god in heaven that
 
05:44:31.590 --> 05:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
governs the universe and he deserves
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
additional respect
 
05:44:36.310 --> 05:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
and we have religious practice
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
in our country has been so protected
 
05:44:39.680 --> 05:44:41.110 align:start position:0%
in our country has been so protected
forever

05:44:41.110 --> 05:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
forever
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
the other is we're not asking for
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
special protection
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
all we're asking is that in this bill
 
05:44:49.990 --> 05:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
that no additional
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions are placed upon them they
 
05:44:54.070 --> 05:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
are according to what that bill says is
 
05:44:56.470 --> 05:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
subject to every other standard use for
 
05:45:02.708 --> 05:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:02.718 --> 05:45:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:45:06.070 --> 05:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:08.070 --> 05:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
05:45:08.080 --> 05:45:13.190 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
today

05:45:13.190 --> 05:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:16.470 --> 05:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:20.230 --> 05:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:21.990 --> 05:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate grace for the
 
05:45:24.390 --> 05:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
we do oppose this bill um and i did
 
05:45:29.030 --> 05:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
provide written testimony
 
05:45:30.788 --> 05:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh electronically
 
05:45:32.628 --> 05:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
and i know for future reference to bring
 
05:45:33.910 --> 05:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
hard copies
 
05:45:33.920 --> 05:45:35.190 align:start position:0%
hard copies
um

05:45:35.190 --> 05:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:38.230 --> 05:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
so as written hb 1021 does not define
 
05:45:39.990 --> 05:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
religious purposes
 
05:45:43.190 --> 05:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
um as such it's unclear how exactly this
 
05:45:44.548 --> 05:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
would apply
 
05:45:44.558 --> 05:45:45.430 align:start position:0%
would apply
um

05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know if it's something simple like
 
05:45:49.510 --> 05:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh an organization wants to build a
 
05:45:51.510 --> 05:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
church mosque synagogue something that's
 
05:45:53.430 --> 05:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
commonly uh
 
05:45:55.270 --> 05:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
commonly understood to be a religious
 
05:45:55.280 --> 05:45:56.310 align:start position:0%
commonly understood to be a religious
purpose

05:45:56.310 --> 05:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:45:58.708 --> 05:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
that's pretty easy to apply
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
but where you have something like a
 
05:46:03.510 --> 05:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
religious group where they're
 
05:46:05.350 --> 05:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
sincere religious belief is ministering
 
05:46:06.868 --> 05:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
to the poor
 
05:46:08.470 --> 05:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore they want to build a soup
 
05:46:08.480 --> 05:46:10.628 align:start position:0%
and therefore they want to build a soup
kitchen

05:46:10.628 --> 05:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
05:46:12.390 --> 05:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps on the property that they
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
already own or perhaps on a different
 
05:46:16.230 --> 05:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
property does that now qualify as a
 
05:46:18.548 --> 05:46:18.558 align:start position:0%
religious purpose and therefore fall
 
05:46:20.230 --> 05:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
under this or would that fall under
 
05:46:21.910 --> 05:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
normal zoning
 
05:46:24.070 --> 05:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't know the answer to that
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
um the other
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
sort of unclear
 
05:46:27.040 --> 05:46:28.230 align:start position:0%
sort of unclear
example

05:46:28.230 --> 05:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:46:28.240 --> 05:46:29.110 align:start position:0%
example
was

05:46:29.110 --> 05:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:46:31.110 --> 05:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh the one brought up by representative
 
05:46:33.030 --> 05:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
wolper which was
 
05:46:34.070 --> 05:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
would this
 
05:46:36.548 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
cover uh you know someone who starts
 
05:46:39.510 --> 05:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
having weekly prayer meetings at their
 
05:46:41.350 --> 05:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
residential property it appears that is
 
05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
the purpose
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
here but at what point does that
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
transform into a religious use
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
um that would that would you know if
 
05:46:52.390 --> 05:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
somebody had to come before a zoning
 
05:46:52.400 --> 05:46:53.270 align:start position:0%
somebody had to come before a zoning
board

05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:46:55.110 --> 05:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't be before you know
 
05:46:56.708 --> 05:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh planning or zoning board unless they
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
were going to
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
build something on that property
 
05:46:59.520 --> 05:47:00.708 align:start position:0%
build something on that property
presumably

05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
05:47:01.990 --> 05:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
although they might have some sort of
 
05:47:04.150 --> 05:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
code enforcement issue
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
um at what point would that would that
 
05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
qualify so if they're going to add an
 
05:47:09.510 --> 05:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
addition to their house
 
05:47:11.270 --> 05:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
and the addition is going to be you know
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
for their weekly prayer meeting
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
does that qualify does it have to be
 
05:47:17.110 --> 05:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
more than once a week
 
05:47:18.868 --> 05:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
it's just very vague
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
05:47:22.708 --> 05:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
really the root of our concern is
 
05:47:24.390 --> 05:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
we don't know how to apply this because
 
05:47:26.310 --> 05:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have a definition for religious
 
05:47:26.320 --> 05:47:28.390 align:start position:0%
we don't have a definition for religious
purposes

05:47:28.390 --> 05:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
05:47:28.400 --> 05:47:29.430 align:start position:0%
purposes
we

05:47:29.430 --> 05:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:47:32.708 --> 05:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
existing law already requires that
 
05:47:34.470 --> 05:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
there is no preferential treatment for
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
one religion over another
 
05:47:38.948 --> 05:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
and what we've seen in zoning cases that
 
05:47:40.310 --> 05:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
have litigated this is religious
 
05:47:40.320 --> 05:47:41.430 align:start position:0%
have litigated this is religious
structures

05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
structures
 
05:47:43.990 --> 05:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
generally have to see the same type of
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
regulations applied to them as secular
 
05:47:46.080 --> 05:47:47.510 align:start position:0%
regulations applied to them as secular
structures

05:47:47.510 --> 05:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
structures
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
in order for whatever the regulation is
 
05:47:51.670 --> 05:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
to be upheld so so long as those two
 
05:47:54.150 --> 05:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
things are happening they should be
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
treated the same
 
05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you

05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
the municipal association that just
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
opposed this because they didn't
 
05:48:38.878 --> 05:48:40.868 align:start position:0%
opposed this because they didn't
understand

05:48:40.868 --> 05:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
what is classified as a church i would
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
say property that is owned by the church
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any definition
 
05:48:50.628 --> 05:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
other than that and the church is
 
05:48:55.430 --> 05:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
recognized as a 501 c 3 corporation
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
how can they not know that's a church
 
05:48:57.360 --> 05:48:59.110 align:start position:0%
how can they not know that's a church
purpose

05:48:59.110 --> 05:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:48:59.120 --> 05:49:00.390 align:start position:0%
purpose
um

05:49:00.390 --> 05:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:00.400 --> 05:49:01.590 align:start position:0%
um
just

05:49:01.590 --> 05:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
our church was established about 12
 
05:49:09.590 --> 05:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:49:09.600 --> 05:49:11.270 align:start position:0%
years ago
and

05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
we were renting space
 
05:49:13.360 --> 05:49:14.708 align:start position:0%
we were renting space
after

05:49:14.708 --> 05:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:49:17.670 --> 05:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
starting out at the ski hut and in a
 
05:49:17.680 --> 05:49:19.430 align:start position:0%
starting out at the ski hut and in a
store

05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
store
 
05:49:22.548 --> 05:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
converting it in on sundays to a worship
 
05:49:22.558 --> 05:49:24.070 align:start position:0%
converting it in on sundays to a worship
service

05:49:24.070 --> 05:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
service
 
05:49:25.190 --> 05:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
we're renting space for almost 10 years
 
05:49:31.350 --> 05:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
but we're gradually getting pushed out
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
by the owner
 
05:49:35.510 --> 05:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
because he needed the space
 
05:49:35.520 --> 05:49:38.788 align:start position:0%
because he needed the space
and

05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
we ended up saying we need to get our
 
05:49:43.350 --> 05:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
own space so we can do things the way we
 
05:49:45.510 --> 05:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
would like to do them
 
05:49:49.590 --> 05:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
so we started looking for property
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
long short
 
05:49:53.910 --> 05:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
took us about three years to find a
 
05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
piece of property that would be close to
 
05:49:56.240 --> 05:49:57.750 align:start position:0%
piece of property that would be close to
suitable

05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
suitable
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
we spent fifty thousand dollars
 
05:50:02.948 --> 05:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
in planning fees and working with the
 
05:50:04.628 --> 05:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
town of bedford
 
05:50:04.638 --> 05:50:06.310 align:start position:0%
town of bedford
um

05:50:06.310 --> 05:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:07.910 --> 05:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
and after we got through the whole
 
05:50:10.708 --> 05:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
process we looked at it and said
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
my gosh if we build here
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
at this price
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
will never be able to expand
 
05:50:18.638 --> 05:50:19.430 align:start position:0%
will never be able to expand
because

05:50:19.430 --> 05:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:50:21.910 --> 05:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
the property behind us was unavailable
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
and we were so close to lot lines it was
 
05:50:26.868 --> 05:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
a very long thin
 
05:50:29.110 --> 05:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
piece of property with two
 
05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
brooks going through it
 
05:50:33.350 --> 05:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
in any case
 
05:50:34.868 --> 05:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
while we were having second thoughts
 
05:50:36.470 --> 05:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
about this
 
05:50:38.310 --> 05:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
we got an offer from the person who
 
05:50:41.590 --> 05:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
owned the property across the street
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
an offer we felt sent by god
 
05:50:47.990 --> 05:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
instead of under three acres we would
 
05:50:50.390 --> 05:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
have over nine acres
 
05:50:53.030 --> 05:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the property had a beautiful house
 
05:50:56.070 --> 05:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we could use for we thought
 
05:50:56.080 --> 05:50:56.830 align:start position:0%
that we could use for we thought
for

05:50:56.830 --> 05:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:50:59.270 --> 05:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
worship while we were building a
 
05:51:01.750 --> 05:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
sanctuary to accommodate a few more
 
05:51:01.760 --> 05:51:03.190 align:start position:0%
sanctuary to accommodate a few more
people

05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
our church at that time was uh we had
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 35 people attending on a
 
05:51:10.708 --> 05:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
sunday morning
 
05:51:13.990 --> 05:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
we had more uh overall that were
 
05:51:14.000 --> 05:51:15.830 align:start position:0%
we had more uh overall that were
attending

05:51:15.830 --> 05:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
attending
 
05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
but there are only 17 members
 
05:51:21.990 --> 05:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
of this church
 
05:51:25.030 --> 05:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
anyways we decided to to go ahead with
 
05:51:26.948 --> 05:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
the project
 
05:51:28.230 --> 05:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
and we
 
05:51:30.150 --> 05:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
spoke to the planning board would there
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
be any problems
 
05:51:36.310 --> 05:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
now we'd had nine acres plus to
 
05:51:39.270 --> 05:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
we worked on it um we got approvals
 
05:51:48.070 --> 05:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:50.948 --> 05:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
we did this all by church members
 
05:51:52.830 --> 05:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
and a logger
 
05:51:52.840 --> 05:51:54.470 align:start position:0%
and a logger
that

05:51:54.470 --> 05:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:51:56.390 --> 05:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
charged us nothing they just took the
 
05:51:56.400 --> 05:51:57.670 align:start position:0%
charged us nothing they just took the
lumber

05:51:57.670 --> 05:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
lumber
 
05:51:59.430 --> 05:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
we did all the clean up
 
05:52:03.990 --> 05:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:07.270 --> 05:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
this is a member project
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
everyone in our entire church has worked
 
05:52:11.910 --> 05:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
on the property
 
05:52:13.990 --> 05:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
while we were building it
 
05:52:17.830 --> 05:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
any cases i don't want to interrupt but
 
05:52:20.628 --> 05:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
you're getting close to your five
 
05:52:23.430 --> 05:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
minutes right now okay
 
05:52:27.030 --> 05:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
i'll try to cut to the chase here
 
05:52:29.670 --> 05:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
in any case we got started we got the
 
05:52:31.750 --> 05:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
approvals necessary
 
05:52:31.760 --> 05:52:33.030 align:start position:0%
approvals necessary
um

05:52:33.030 --> 05:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
and so we went for our building permit
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
we had started clearing in december of
 
05:52:38.798 --> 05:52:40.070 align:start position:0%
we had started clearing in december of
20

05:52:40.070 --> 05:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
20
 
05:52:42.948 --> 05:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
and we went for our building permit in
 
05:52:44.788 --> 05:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
may thinking it'd only take a few days
 
05:52:47.750 --> 05:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:50.868 --> 05:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
it took us till the end of august to get
 
05:52:52.390 --> 05:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
the permit
 
05:52:54.070 --> 05:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
by then the mission team that we had
 
05:52:56.548 --> 05:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
lined up to come and do the framing on
 
05:52:57.750 --> 05:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
the structure
 
05:53:02.230 --> 05:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:05.670 --> 05:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
we couldn't dig to do some other things
 
05:53:05.680 --> 05:53:06.708 align:start position:0%
we couldn't dig to do some other things
besides

05:53:06.708 --> 05:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
besides
 
05:53:08.470 --> 05:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
putting in the parking lot we were able
 
05:53:10.868 --> 05:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
to dig there but when we wanted to dig
 
05:53:13.270 --> 05:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
for a new power line
 
05:53:15.030 --> 05:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't let us do that because
 
05:53:17.590 --> 05:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
that went under the building permit
 
05:53:20.310 --> 05:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
they just blocked us on everything
 
05:53:22.548 --> 05:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
so we couldn't couldn't do all this work
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
we finally did get the building up
 
05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
and we did get the power moved
 
05:53:27.360 --> 05:53:29.030 align:start position:0%
and we did get the power moved
um

05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:30.310 --> 05:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
and what do we
 
05:53:33.190 --> 05:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
get for our reward for our work we get a
 
05:53:35.510 --> 05:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
cease and desist order from the town
 
05:53:37.430 --> 05:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
saying we can no longer have worship
 
05:53:37.440 --> 05:53:40.310 align:start position:0%
saying we can no longer have worship
services

05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:40.320 --> 05:53:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
we

05:53:41.110 --> 05:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:53:43.510 --> 05:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
started on in march
 
05:53:44.948 --> 05:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
of 20.
 
05:53:47.670 --> 05:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
we had the living room which could
 
05:53:50.948 --> 05:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
easily hold 30 people
 
05:53:53.830 --> 05:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
all set up for services and the governor
 
05:53:55.750 --> 05:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
of course gave his edict about it
 
05:53:55.760 --> 05:53:57.910 align:start position:0%
of course gave his edict about it
covered

05:53:57.910 --> 05:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
covered
 
05:53:59.990 --> 05:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
we couldn't meet
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
so we couldn't apply for tax exemption
 
05:54:04.548 --> 05:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
we thought
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh among other things in any case
 
05:54:11.430 --> 05:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
about may we started meeting we we
 
05:54:13.990 --> 05:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
started first broadcasting with for our
 
05:54:17.270 --> 05:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
zoom mem meetings and then we had people
 
05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
who wanted to come
 
05:54:20.708 --> 05:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
and actually worship in person and we
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
started doing that so we had been
 
05:54:22.798 --> 05:54:24.310 align:start position:0%
started doing that so we had been
worshiping

05:54:24.310 --> 05:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
worshiping
 
05:54:24.320 --> 05:54:25.190 align:start position:0%
worshiping
for

05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:54:25.200 --> 05:54:26.070 align:start position:0%
for
um

05:54:26.070 --> 05:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:30.070 --> 05:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half
 
05:54:33.110 --> 05:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
and suddenly we get to cease and desist
 
05:54:35.990 --> 05:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
well it's no longer safe
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
we had logging trucks coming in
 
05:54:41.430 --> 05:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
we had to every week we had to prepare
 
05:54:44.390 --> 05:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
parking spaces so it would be safe and a
 
05:54:47.030 --> 05:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
clear path for our members to meet
 
05:54:49.670 --> 05:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden the town says it's
 
05:54:51.510 --> 05:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
not safe
 
05:54:54.310 --> 05:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
if they didn't want us to meet they
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
should have done that at the beginning
 
05:54:58.310 --> 05:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
no one ever said that when we started
 
05:55:00.628 --> 05:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
the construction of the addition for our
 
05:55:03.110 --> 05:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
sanctuary that we would not be able to
 
05:55:05.110 --> 05:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
meet in the church
 
05:55:07.110 --> 05:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
and they pulled well you don't have a
 
05:55:09.190 --> 05:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy
 
05:55:11.350 --> 05:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
we had a certificate of occupancy as a
 
05:55:13.990 --> 05:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
residence and we could hold
 
05:55:15.670 --> 05:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
meetings there
 
05:55:16.948 --> 05:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
and the town
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
originally said
 
05:55:21.030 --> 05:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
we won't bother you
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
but then all of a sudden the cease and
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
desist we're fighting that in the courts
 
05:55:25.040 --> 05:55:27.510 align:start position:0%
desist we're fighting that in the courts
now

05:55:27.510 --> 05:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:30.548 --> 05:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
if we had to pay for the lawyers
 
05:55:33.670 --> 05:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
it would be a huge bill
 
05:55:36.150 --> 05:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
but we're we've been getting a wonderful
 
05:55:36.160 --> 05:55:37.750 align:start position:0%
but we're we've been getting a wonderful
uh

05:55:37.750 --> 05:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:55:40.868 --> 05:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
bono uh support
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
but that that's just one other thing i i
 
05:55:46.310 --> 05:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
could give you other little incidences
 
05:55:46.320 --> 05:55:47.190 align:start position:0%
could give you other little incidences
um

05:55:47.190 --> 05:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
do i have any time at all
 
05:55:52.708 --> 05:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
uh well you've done about 10 minutes so
 
05:55:54.628 --> 05:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
all right then i'll
 
05:55:57.190 --> 05:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
let me just give you one
 
05:55:57.200 --> 05:55:59.350 align:start position:0%
let me just give you one
um

05:55:59.350 --> 05:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:02.150 --> 05:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
of course the house had a kitchen
 
05:56:05.350 --> 05:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
and the kitchen
 
05:56:08.470 --> 05:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
entered on into a an attached garage
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
we tore the attached garage down
 
05:56:13.510 --> 05:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
and built our sanctuary there
 
05:56:15.910 --> 05:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
well we wanted to use that as an exit
 
05:56:17.670 --> 05:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
well you can't exit through a commercial
 
05:56:17.680 --> 05:56:18.868 align:start position:0%
well you can't exit through a commercial
kitchen

05:56:18.868 --> 05:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
kitchen
 
05:56:21.510 --> 05:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have a commercial kitchen
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have a house kitchen
 
05:56:27.590 --> 05:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
one for burner stove
 
05:56:30.390 --> 05:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
we're not going to feed an army there
 
05:56:32.708 --> 05:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
even the new sanctuary is only
 
05:56:34.948 --> 05:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
rated to hold 50 people
 
05:56:36.548 --> 05:56:36.558 align:start position:0%
and if we had learned
 
05:56:36.558 --> 05:56:37.830 align:start position:0%
and if we had learned
sooner

05:56:37.830 --> 05:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
sooner
 
05:56:39.590 --> 05:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
and could have been
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's an a3
 
05:56:42.000 --> 05:56:43.670 align:start position:0%
that's an a3
designation

05:56:43.670 --> 05:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
designation
 
05:56:46.788 --> 05:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
we could have said we only want 49
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the the the problem we have
 
05:56:52.230 --> 05:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't happen
 
05:56:54.470 --> 05:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
one other thing this law does not take
 
05:56:57.510 --> 05:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
into consideration the size of a church
 
05:57:00.788 --> 05:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
and a church that has 500 people yeah
 
05:57:03.510 --> 05:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
they'd better have commercial uh access
 
05:57:04.708 --> 05:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
and all that
 
05:57:07.670 --> 05:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
but a church that is trying to get that
 
05:57:07.680 --> 05:57:08.470 align:start position:0%
but a church that is trying to get that
and

05:57:08.470 --> 05:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:11.830 --> 05:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
and transitioning just can't afford all
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
of this baloney
 
05:57:15.430 --> 05:57:15.440 align:start position:0%

05:58:19.430 --> 05:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
110 percent support hb
 
05:58:22.788 --> 05:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
um 1021 as written and i ask that the
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh support its adoption
 
05:58:29.110 --> 05:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
land use regulations should be based on
 
05:58:31.990 --> 05:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
neutral land use criteria such as the
 
05:58:34.548 --> 05:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
size of a building or maybe the location
 
05:58:36.548 --> 05:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
the number of occupants or the traffic
 
05:58:36.558 --> 05:58:38.070 align:start position:0%
the number of occupants or the traffic
impact

05:58:38.070 --> 05:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
impact
 
05:58:40.628 --> 05:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
it should never be based on the
 
05:58:43.270 --> 05:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
religious nature or the non-religious
 
05:58:45.270 --> 05:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
nature the religious purpose or the
 
05:58:47.670 --> 05:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
non-religious purpose of why people are
 
05:58:49.830 --> 05:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
gathering or where they're gathering
 
05:58:51.590 --> 05:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
whether people are meeting for religious
 
05:58:54.788 --> 05:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
or non-religious purposes is not ever a
 
05:58:54.798 --> 05:58:56.150 align:start position:0%
or non-religious purposes is not ever a
basis

05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
basis
 
05:58:59.590 --> 05:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
for a municipal regulation
 
05:59:01.270 --> 05:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
nevertheless throughout the state of new
 
05:59:03.350 --> 05:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire many towns
 
05:59:06.708 --> 05:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
regulate land use based on the religious
 
05:59:08.948 --> 05:59:08.958 align:start position:0%
nature or the non-religious nature of an
 
05:59:08.958 --> 05:59:10.470 align:start position:0%
nature or the non-religious nature of an
assembly

05:59:10.470 --> 05:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
assembly
 
05:59:13.270 --> 05:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
this is clearly unconstitutional
 
05:59:14.310 --> 05:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
but the
 
05:59:17.030 --> 05:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
process for obtaining judicial relief is
 
05:59:19.270 --> 05:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
a long and expensive process not
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
available to particularly minority
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
religions or small churches
 
05:59:25.670 --> 05:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
so let me just tell you a couple
 
05:59:27.110 --> 05:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
snippets of what i've seen around the
 
05:59:29.670 --> 05:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
state over the past 10 years about 10
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
years ago you had this church in
 
05:59:33.830 --> 05:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
goffstown that wanted to build on a
 
05:59:36.470 --> 05:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
property where an event center
 
05:59:37.830 --> 05:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
was allowed
 
05:59:40.310 --> 05:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
but churches because of the religious
 
05:59:42.868 --> 05:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
purpose was not allowed
 
05:59:44.470 --> 05:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
they therefore needed to go through the
 
05:59:46.628 --> 05:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
variance criteria but the variance
 
05:59:49.270 --> 05:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
criteria doesn't include a provision for
 
05:59:51.430 --> 05:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
whether the ordinance is unlawfully
 
05:59:53.110 --> 05:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
discriminating or unconstitutionally
 
05:59:56.708 --> 05:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
discriminating between the purpose of an
 
05:59:58.788 --> 05:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
assembly of being religious or
 
05:59:58.798 --> 06:00:00.150 align:start position:0%
assembly of being religious or
non-religious

06:00:00.150 --> 06:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
non-religious
 
06:00:02.868 --> 06:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
and so the town was stuck in a bind we
 
06:00:05.430 --> 06:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
had to go through a long process we did
 
06:00:07.350 --> 06:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
eventually settle that case in federal
 
06:00:09.430 --> 06:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
court but not until it went through
 
06:00:12.548 --> 06:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
needless time delay and expense not just
 
06:00:14.868 --> 06:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
for the church but for the town as well
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
the town had to spend tens of thousands
 
06:00:19.430 --> 06:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
of dollars
 
06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
several years ago you had the
 
06:00:23.830 --> 06:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
incident over in pembroke next level
 
06:00:25.750 --> 06:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
church wanted to convert an existing
 
06:00:27.590 --> 06:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
building into a church in a commercial
 
06:00:30.788 --> 06:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
district that allowed movie theaters
 
06:00:33.110 --> 06:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
and other commercial assemblies but not
 
06:00:33.120 --> 06:00:34.548 align:start position:0%
and other commercial assemblies but not
churches

06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
churches
 
06:00:36.390 --> 06:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
ironically when next level church was
 
06:00:38.230 --> 06:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
going to be opening up in that location
 
06:00:41.430 --> 06:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to be having their sermons
 
06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
be telecast from a different location
 
06:00:46.150 --> 06:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
and people are going to be sitting in a
 
06:00:48.470 --> 06:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
room that looked remarkably like a movie
 
06:00:51.750 --> 06:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
theater um and watching the sermon up on
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
a screen
 
06:00:55.990 --> 06:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
but because the content of that sermon
 
06:00:57.430 --> 06:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
was religious
 
06:00:59.110 --> 06:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
it wasn't allowed in that zoning
 
06:01:02.230 --> 06:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
district because the pembroke ordinance
 
06:01:02.240 --> 06:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
district because the pembroke ordinance
prohibited

06:01:03.430 --> 06:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
06:01:05.190 --> 06:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
churches from the commercial district
 
06:01:07.350 --> 06:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
while allowing movie theaters
 
06:01:10.310 --> 06:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
again thankfully we were able to after a
 
06:01:12.628 --> 06:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
period of time get that resolved and the
 
06:01:15.510 --> 06:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
church is currently operating there
 
06:01:17.590 --> 06:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
in hanover similar to what happened in
 
06:01:19.830 --> 06:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
pembroke you have a zoning ordinance
 
06:01:22.390 --> 06:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
that allows movie theaters
 
06:01:24.628 --> 06:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
but prohibits churches
 
06:01:26.708 --> 06:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
it allows movie theaters in the business
 
06:01:29.350 --> 06:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
district tells churches you have to go
 
06:01:31.350 --> 06:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
over the residential district and unlike
 
06:01:33.030 --> 06:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
movie theaters that are permitted as of
 
06:01:35.750 --> 06:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
right in the residential district you
 
06:01:37.750 --> 06:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
have to go through a long complicated
 
06:01:40.230 --> 06:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
process and convince the zoning board
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
that you fit within the character of the
 
06:01:44.628 --> 06:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
area however the zoning board may
 
06:01:47.110 --> 06:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
discretionarily determine the character
 
06:01:49.110 --> 06:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
of the area
 
06:01:51.670 --> 06:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
now we heard a couple minutes ago
 
06:01:54.470 --> 06:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
that the durham church i think was going
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
on for five or six years
 
06:01:58.708 --> 06:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
um the the church in hanover right now
 
06:02:00.788 --> 06:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
is going on almost seven and a half
 
06:02:03.670 --> 06:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
years in order to get approvals in order
 
06:02:06.390 --> 06:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
to build the court has already made some
 
06:02:08.310 --> 06:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
rulings that the discretionary authority
 
06:02:10.470 --> 06:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
is unlawful unconstitutional
 
06:02:12.150 --> 06:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
other rulings are currently under appeal
 
06:02:14.230 --> 06:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire supreme court and
 
06:02:16.310 --> 06:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that it it limits it eight
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
years it wouldn't go on to nine or ten
 
06:02:17.920 --> 06:02:20.070 align:start position:0%
years it wouldn't go on to nine or ten
years

06:02:20.070 --> 06:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that's hundreds of thousands of
 
06:02:23.830 --> 06:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
dollars in costs to both the church and
 
06:02:25.590 --> 06:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
the town
 
06:02:28.230 --> 06:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
in bedford mr godek talked about his
 
06:02:30.548 --> 06:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
experience there but just to give you
 
06:02:32.390 --> 06:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
what i see would be fixed by this
 
06:02:35.350 --> 06:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
particular ordinance that in bedford the
 
06:02:37.350 --> 06:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
town is interpreting
 
06:02:40.070 --> 06:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
their ordinances to say that residential
 
06:02:42.548 --> 06:02:42.558 align:start position:0%
use and religious use are two different
 
06:02:44.868 --> 06:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
things and that when you have six people
 
06:02:48.150 --> 06:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
get together in order to have a birthday
 
06:02:50.230 --> 06:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
party at somebody's residence that's
 
06:02:52.628 --> 06:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
under one set of safety codes but when
 
06:02:54.628 --> 06:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
you have six people get together in
 
06:02:57.190 --> 06:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
order to have a bible study it's under a
 
06:02:59.910 --> 06:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
different set of safety codes the same
 
06:03:02.070 --> 06:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
number of people gathering the same
 
06:03:04.708 --> 06:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
exact room that has had no construction
 
06:03:07.590 --> 06:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
done to it has two different sets of
 
06:03:09.910 --> 06:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
safety codes because of the religious
 
06:03:12.390 --> 06:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of the gathering
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
and so the problem is just not limited
 
06:03:15.990 --> 06:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
to church let me be clear
 
06:03:17.590 --> 06:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to keep picking on bedford
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
for a little bit
 
06:03:21.430 --> 06:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
with all due re respect representative
 
06:03:22.708 --> 06:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
gould but in bedford they also have this
 
06:03:24.868 --> 06:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
parking ordinance and the parking
 
06:03:27.910 --> 06:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
ordinance in bedford has one rule for
 
06:03:29.350 --> 06:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
movie theaters
 
06:03:32.070 --> 06:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
you need more if you're a church and you
 
06:03:35.110 --> 06:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
need even more if you're a mosque
 
06:03:35.120 --> 06:03:35.990 align:start position:0%
need even more if you're a mosque
um

06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:39.590 --> 06:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
bedford is regulating how many
 
06:03:42.310 --> 06:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
parking spaces you have and saying that
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
if you do not recognize the divinity of
 
06:03:47.590 --> 06:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
jesus christ and you're worshiping in a
 
06:03:49.590 --> 06:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
mosque instead of in a church
 
06:03:51.270 --> 06:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
you need almost double the number of
 
06:03:52.948 --> 06:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
parking spaces
 
06:03:55.510 --> 06:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
frankly that's just ridiculous
 
06:03:58.230 --> 06:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
in many many states over half the states
 
06:03:59.910 --> 06:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
06:04:02.788 --> 06:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
unlawful by state statute
 
06:04:05.190 --> 06:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
in fact right down our neighbor to the
 
06:04:08.230 --> 06:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
south massachusetts has this statute
 
06:04:10.470 --> 06:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
called the dover amendment
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
that is very similar to the language of
 
06:04:15.990 --> 06:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
hb 1021
 
06:04:20.070 --> 06:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
in that it prohibits the regulation of
 
06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
land use for religious purposes
 
06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
you can regulate land use based on the
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
size of a building based on the number
 
06:04:29.830 --> 06:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
of occupants but not because of the
 
06:04:29.840 --> 06:04:30.868 align:start position:0%
of occupants but not because of the
purpose

06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
06:04:33.430 --> 06:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
being religious and the dover amendment
 
06:04:35.110 --> 06:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
down in massachusetts has been on the
 
06:04:37.910 --> 06:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
books for 70 years they've had lots of
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
success with the dover amendment for the
 
06:04:43.190 --> 06:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
past 70 years and the language um that
 
06:04:44.548 --> 06:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
we heard the new hampshire municipal
 
06:04:44.558 --> 06:04:46.150 align:start position:0%
we heard the new hampshire municipal
association

06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
association
 
06:04:48.788 --> 06:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
say is ambiguous for religious purposes
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
that's identical
 
06:04:53.590 --> 06:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
to the language in many state statutes
 
06:04:56.310 --> 06:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
including the massachusetts dover
 
06:04:56.320 --> 06:04:57.590 align:start position:0%
including the massachusetts dover
amendment

06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
i also just want to make clear that
 
06:05:00.708 --> 06:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
religious purposes language is also
 
06:05:02.470 --> 06:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
identical to the language in new
 
06:05:05.350 --> 06:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire rsa 7223
 
06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
which is the tax exemption statute and
 
06:05:11.510 --> 06:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
so land use for religious purposes in hb
 
06:05:11.520 --> 06:05:13.270 align:start position:0%
so land use for religious purposes in hb
1021

06:05:13.270 --> 06:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
1021
 
06:05:16.150 --> 06:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
mirrors land use for religious purposes
 
06:05:17.548 --> 06:05:17.558 align:start position:0%
in rsa
 
06:05:20.708 --> 06:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
7223 and what is land use for religious
 
06:05:20.718 --> 06:05:21.830 align:start position:0%
7223 and what is land use for religious
purposes

06:05:21.830 --> 06:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
we've had 70 years of experience in new
 
06:05:26.150 --> 06:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire for the tax exemption we're
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
just pulling on over to um
 
06:05:29.280 --> 06:05:30.708 align:start position:0%
just pulling on over to um
the

06:05:30.708 --> 06:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:05:33.190 --> 06:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
land use context
 
06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
and so i just want to be 100 percent
 
06:05:37.830 --> 06:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
clear this bill does not give
 
06:05:39.830 --> 06:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
preferential treatment to churches you
 
06:05:41.910 --> 06:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
can think of this as the movie theater
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
bill okay if a town is saying that you
 
06:05:47.750 --> 06:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
need to have four parking spaces for
 
06:05:50.150 --> 06:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
each seat in a movie theater it needs to
 
06:05:52.948 --> 06:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
say four parking for
 
06:05:54.708 --> 06:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
one parking space for every four seats
 
06:05:56.708 --> 06:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
in a church or in a mosque or in a
 
06:05:59.110 --> 06:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
synagogue it can't have a different
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
standard based on the religious nature
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
or the religious content
 
06:06:05.910 --> 06:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
there are all sorts of land use
 
06:06:07.670 --> 06:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
regulations which are narrow objective
 
06:06:10.230 --> 06:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
and definite whole building code those
 
06:06:12.310 --> 06:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
can be applied to churches synagogues
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
mosques what have you on the same way
 
06:06:16.548 --> 06:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
that they're applied to movie theaters
 
06:06:19.990 --> 06:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
walmarts or whatever else you just can't
 
06:06:22.230 --> 06:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
apply a standard differently because of
 
06:06:24.070 --> 06:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
the religious nature and i see that i'm
 
06:06:26.070 --> 06:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
going over time so i just have written
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
submission if i can just pass it around
 
06:06:30.390 --> 06:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
it'll be super that'd be wonderful
 
06:06:32.230 --> 06:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney
 
06:06:32.240 --> 06:06:36.948 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney

06:06:48.470 --> 06:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
seeing no one will close the hearing on

06:08:13.110 --> 06:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1519 defining religious
 
06:08:14.310 --> 06:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
belief and protecting it from
 
06:08:14.320 --> 06:08:16.470 align:start position:0%
belief and protecting it from
discrimination

06:08:16.470 --> 06:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
06:08:18.470 --> 06:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is the result of discussions
 
06:08:21.510 --> 06:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
that i had with voters in my district
 
06:08:23.830 --> 06:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
the initial issue revolved around some
 
06:08:25.830 --> 06:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
of the voters in my district who are
 
06:08:27.990 --> 06:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
seeking realistic religious exemptions
 
06:08:29.670 --> 06:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
from their employer
 
06:08:31.190 --> 06:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
and there was concern that some of the
 
06:08:31.200 --> 06:08:32.390 align:start position:0%
and there was concern that some of the
companies

06:08:32.390 --> 06:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
companies
 
06:08:34.868 --> 06:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
were requiring the individuals to answer
 
06:08:37.030 --> 06:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
long questionnaires and even get
 
06:08:38.948 --> 06:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
supportive documentation from religious
 
06:08:41.910 --> 06:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
leaders to justify
 
06:08:44.548 --> 06:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
their their exemption and they were
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
curious as to what course the
 
06:08:48.310 --> 06:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
of action they could take
 
06:08:52.070 --> 06:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
if their exemption was rejected
 
06:08:54.150 --> 06:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
so i started looking into the issue and
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
i found that the state commission on
 
06:08:59.590 --> 06:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
for human rights fields complaints of
 
06:09:01.510 --> 06:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination in our state
 
06:09:01.520 --> 06:09:02.390 align:start position:0%
discrimination in our state
um

06:09:02.390 --> 06:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:04.150 --> 06:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
and within the anti-discrimination
 
06:09:07.190 --> 06:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
statutes there were many areas where
 
06:09:10.708 --> 06:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
an individual's creed or
 
06:09:12.868 --> 06:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
where the word creed or religion was
 
06:09:14.548 --> 06:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
used and it was protected against
 
06:09:14.558 --> 06:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
used and it was protected against
discrimination

06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
06:09:16.080 --> 06:09:17.910 align:start position:0%
discrimination
um

06:09:17.910 --> 06:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:20.230 --> 06:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
but with both the the term creed and the
 
06:09:21.990 --> 06:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
term religion
 
06:09:25.030 --> 06:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
they their definition revolves around a
 
06:09:27.750 --> 06:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
formal statement of religious belief um
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
a confession of faith um
 
06:09:32.948 --> 06:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
a system of belief
 
06:09:35.270 --> 06:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
or a set of beliefs based on the
 
06:09:37.430 --> 06:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
teachings of a spiritual leader
 
06:09:37.440 --> 06:09:38.548 align:start position:0%
teachings of a spiritual leader
and

06:09:38.548 --> 06:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:42.230 --> 06:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
this ran contrary in my mind to the
 
06:09:42.240 --> 06:09:43.670 align:start position:0%
this ran contrary in my mind to the
um

06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:45.910 --> 06:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
to the natural right that it was trying
 
06:09:47.910 --> 06:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
to that we were trying to protect people
 
06:09:49.990 --> 06:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
from being discriminated against
 
06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
06:09:59.110 --> 06:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
the definition revolves around a simple
 
06:09:59.120 --> 06:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
the definition revolves around a simple
concept

06:10:00.470 --> 06:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
concept
 
06:10:02.548 --> 06:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
that every individual has a natural and
 
06:10:04.708 --> 06:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
unalienable right to worship god in
 
06:10:07.830 --> 06:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
accordance to the dictates of his own
 
06:10:09.910 --> 06:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
conscience and reason
 
06:10:12.390 --> 06:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
and the intent of 1519 is to better
 
06:10:15.190 --> 06:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
align and protect the protections
 
06:10:17.430 --> 06:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
provided to the actual rights we're
 
06:10:20.230 --> 06:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
seeking to protect
 
06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
it does two important things it puts the
 
06:10:25.190 --> 06:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
definition of religious belief it aligns
 
06:10:25.200 --> 06:10:26.470 align:start position:0%
definition of religious belief it aligns
it

06:10:26.470 --> 06:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:10:28.948 --> 06:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
to a the dictates of an individual's
 
06:10:30.788 --> 06:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
conscience rather than a formal
 
06:10:33.830 --> 06:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
statement system or religious authority
 
06:10:35.190 --> 06:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
um most importantly it also seeks to get
 
06:10:39.430 --> 06:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
the government out of the religious
 
06:10:41.910 --> 06:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
approval and disapproval business
 
06:10:44.070 --> 06:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
and get them focused on whether or not a
 
06:10:47.030 --> 06:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
person is being discriminated against
 
06:10:50.708 --> 06:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
so um it defines religious belief as
 
06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
the spiritual worshipping
 
06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
as the spiritual worshipping
 
06:10:56.868 --> 06:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
um in the manner and season most
 
06:10:58.310 --> 06:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
agreeable to the dictates of an
 
06:11:00.708 --> 06:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
individual's conscience and then inserts
 
06:11:02.470 --> 06:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
the religious belief term
 
06:11:03.510 --> 06:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the existing
 
06:11:06.708 --> 06:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statutes and the rsa
 
06:11:07.830 --> 06:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
is defining
 
06:11:09.750 --> 06:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
the state commission for human rights
 
06:11:13.510 --> 06:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:13.520 --> 06:11:14.708 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:11:14.708 --> 06:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:14.718 --> 06:11:17.910 align:start position:0%
and
so

06:11:17.910 --> 06:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:17.920 --> 06:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
in

06:11:19.350 --> 06:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
in uh in doing that what we're what i'm
 
06:11:22.160 --> 06:11:23.270 align:start position:0%
in uh in doing that what we're what i'm
basically

06:11:23.270 --> 06:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
basically
 
06:11:25.030 --> 06:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish
 
06:11:28.150 --> 06:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
is um to
 
06:11:28.160 --> 06:11:29.270 align:start position:0%
is um to
get

06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:11:31.590 --> 06:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
the government out of stan you know out
 
06:11:33.510 --> 06:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
of doing the approval or disapproval of
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
an individual's religious beliefs
 
06:11:37.990 --> 06:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
and get it more toward is this person
 
06:11:40.310 --> 06:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against because of
 
06:11:42.070 --> 06:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
of those beliefs rather than whether or
 
06:11:45.110 --> 06:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
not the beliefs are legitimate
 
06:11:46.868 --> 06:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
um i asked the committee to join me in
 
06:11:48.310 --> 06:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
supporting this legislat this
 
06:11:50.230 --> 06:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and passing the bill out of
 
06:11:52.390 --> 06:11:52.400 align:start position:0%

and i'll take questions
 
06:11:56.708 --> 06:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
06:12:00.948 --> 06:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:04.548 --> 06:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:05.910 --> 06:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
06:12:08.150 --> 06:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:12:08.160 --> 06:12:09.110 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

06:12:09.110 --> 06:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:12.070 --> 06:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think i'm trying to
 
06:12:13.910 --> 06:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
i do um
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
personally apart from the legislature do
 
06:12:17.990 --> 06:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
some interfaith work and i'm trying to
 
06:12:18.000 --> 06:12:19.110 align:start position:0%
some interfaith work and i'm trying to
understand

06:12:19.110 --> 06:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
understand
 
06:12:19.120 --> 06:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
understand
where

06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:12:23.110 --> 06:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
those who define their religion more
 
06:12:24.868 --> 06:12:24.878 align:start position:0%
around practices
 
06:12:28.150 --> 06:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
than beliefs particularly how that would
 
06:12:29.990 --> 06:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
fit into your
 
06:12:30.000 --> 06:12:30.868 align:start position:0%
fit into your
um

06:12:30.868 --> 06:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:32.628 --> 06:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
to the legislation and the way you have
 
06:12:35.910 --> 06:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
defined religious belief
 
06:12:37.670 --> 06:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh when i was trying to define this i
 
06:12:41.350 --> 06:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
was trying to align it to to um
 
06:12:43.590 --> 06:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
the way our constitution defines
 
06:12:45.270 --> 06:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
religious freedom
 
06:12:45.280 --> 06:12:46.628 align:start position:0%
religious freedom
and

06:12:46.628 --> 06:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:48.470 --> 06:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things i did change in that i
 
06:12:51.670 --> 06:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
didn't go directly to that that and just
 
06:12:53.830 --> 06:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
pull in that definition because the
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
definition is the worship of god and
 
06:13:01.110 --> 06:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's i tried to make it as
 
06:13:03.910 --> 06:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
encompassing as i could okay so there's
 
06:13:06.070 --> 06:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
people that don't believe in a single
 
06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
god um like perhaps buddhists or there's
 
06:13:11.670 --> 06:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
people that believe in multiple gods
 
06:13:14.070 --> 06:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
like hindus and we have populations of
 
06:13:16.628 --> 06:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
both in our our state and i want
 
06:13:18.390 --> 06:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
them to have you know that to be
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
legitimate for them as well you know and
 
06:13:22.788 --> 06:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
encompass all the different possible
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
religions and therefore
 
06:13:27.590 --> 06:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
when i put it into to
 
06:13:29.750 --> 06:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
reflect that it's um that it's a
 
06:13:29.760 --> 06:13:30.868 align:start position:0%
reflect that it's um that it's a
spiritual

06:13:30.868 --> 06:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
spiritual
 
06:13:33.830 --> 06:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
worshiping okay i would imagine that
 
06:13:36.390 --> 06:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
that what you're describing would fall
 
06:13:38.390 --> 06:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
fall under that okay who would fall
 
06:13:41.110 --> 06:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
under a spiritual worshiping
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
in the dictates that's most agreeable to
 
06:13:45.750 --> 06:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
the dictates of that individual's
 
06:13:45.760 --> 06:13:46.868 align:start position:0%
the dictates of that individual's
conscience

06:13:46.868 --> 06:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
06:13:49.110 --> 06:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
and their logic so i i think it would
 
06:13:51.030 --> 06:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
incorporate that
 
06:13:54.230 --> 06:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:59.190 --> 06:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:01.430 --> 06:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:22.628 --> 06:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
representative edwards you've changed
 
06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
i apologize i i had spoken with
 
06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative edwards before um
 
06:14:38.070 --> 06:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
there there is i when i did this i went
 
06:14:40.470 --> 06:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
through all the statute i could find
 
06:14:42.788 --> 06:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
where it would apply okay
 
06:14:44.948 --> 06:14:44.958 align:start position:0%
and and it was pointed out to me that
 
06:14:47.910 --> 06:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps i missed some and i had
 
06:14:50.070 --> 06:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
if i've missed any and you and it can be
 
06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
found i'm more than happy to amend to
 
06:14:55.430 --> 06:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
that um so if there's there's brand new
 
06:14:55.440 --> 06:14:56.788 align:start position:0%
that um so if there's there's brand new
legislation

06:14:56.788 --> 06:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:14:59.270 --> 06:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
that was recently passed that it might
 
06:15:02.070 --> 06:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
need to go into i'm very open to that
 
06:15:05.670 --> 06:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:11.350 --> 06:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
this is starting to feel like a who wore
 
06:15:17.110 --> 06:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
it better episode but um so i'm i'm
 
06:15:19.110 --> 06:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative jess edwards representing
 
06:15:21.270 --> 06:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
auburn chester and sandown
 
06:15:23.990 --> 06:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh when i heard representative foster
 
06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
was sponsoring this bill i i got pretty
 
06:15:29.030 --> 06:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
excited about participating in it
 
06:15:31.990 --> 06:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
as a nation founded by people fleeing
 
06:15:32.000 --> 06:15:33.270 align:start position:0%
as a nation founded by people fleeing
religious

06:15:33.270 --> 06:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
religious
 
06:15:33.280 --> 06:15:35.510 align:start position:0%
religious
persecution

06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
persecution
 
06:15:37.990 --> 06:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's fundamental to our nation's
 
06:15:41.350 --> 06:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
dna to respect religious beliefs
 
06:15:44.070 --> 06:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
individual religious beliefs and so i
 
06:15:45.990 --> 06:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
was kind of horrified
 
06:15:47.990 --> 06:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency
 
06:15:48.000 --> 06:15:49.270 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency
when

06:15:49.270 --> 06:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:15:49.280 --> 06:15:50.310 align:start position:0%
when
we

06:15:50.310 --> 06:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:15:50.320 --> 06:15:51.750 align:start position:0%
we
prohibited

06:15:51.750 --> 06:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
06:15:55.030 --> 06:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
worship but you could go to home depot
 
06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
and i don't begrudge people going to
 
06:15:59.590 --> 06:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
home depot i went to home depot but
 
06:16:02.070 --> 06:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
barring people from going and practicing
 
06:16:05.350 --> 06:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
their religion i i thought was deeply
 
06:16:08.230 --> 06:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
offensive uh to our history and into
 
06:16:10.390 --> 06:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
what kind of nation we want to be
 
06:16:13.270 --> 06:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
so i i support this bill it's very
 
06:16:15.830 --> 06:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
mechanical it's not very sexy because it
 
06:16:18.070 --> 06:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
just goes kachinka kachinka kachinka
 
06:16:20.150 --> 06:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
every place that there's uh sort of a
 
06:16:20.160 --> 06:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
every place that there's uh sort of a
discriminate

06:16:21.590 --> 06:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
06:16:23.830 --> 06:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
listing of protected classes it gets
 
06:16:23.840 --> 06:16:25.270 align:start position:0%
listing of protected classes it gets
added

06:16:25.270 --> 06:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
added
 
06:16:28.470 --> 06:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
but one thing that got overlooked and i
 
06:16:31.910 --> 06:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
think does beg for an amendment
 
06:16:31.920 --> 06:16:32.788 align:start position:0%
think does beg for an amendment
is

06:16:32.788 --> 06:16:32.798 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:16:35.190 --> 06:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
in hb2 where we passed
 
06:16:38.230 --> 06:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
the non-discrimination provisions around
 
06:16:38.240 --> 06:16:39.510 align:start position:0%
the non-discrimination provisions around
education

06:16:39.510 --> 06:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
06:16:42.390 --> 06:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
the teaching of students
 
06:16:46.150 --> 06:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
that is not in this bill and so
 
06:16:47.590 --> 06:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
if the committee
 
06:16:51.110 --> 06:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
is is open to passing this bill
 
06:16:52.628 --> 06:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh i i
 
06:16:53.990 --> 06:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
i assume
 
06:16:56.110 --> 06:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
uh it would be relatively
 
06:16:57.910 --> 06:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
non-controversial if you're open to
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
passing it to also include the education
 
06:17:03.110 --> 06:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
section that
 
06:17:06.470 --> 06:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
found its birth in hb2 in june
 
06:17:06.480 --> 06:17:08.628 align:start position:0%
found its birth in hb2 in june
so

06:17:08.628 --> 06:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:17:10.548 --> 06:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
so that's really it
 
06:17:12.230 --> 06:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions i'd happy to
 
06:17:14.150 --> 06:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
take them
 
06:17:18.708 --> 06:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:20.070 --> 06:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
06:17:22.390 --> 06:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:17:22.400 --> 06:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:25.750 --> 06:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
i can you flesh that out for me i'm not
 
06:17:28.628 --> 06:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
really clear which part of hb2 you're
 
06:17:30.390 --> 06:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
referring to and
 
06:17:30.400 --> 06:17:31.190 align:start position:0%
referring to and
um

06:17:31.190 --> 06:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:32.788 --> 06:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
if you can just go into some detail
 
06:17:34.548 --> 06:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
about where you would be putting
 
06:17:37.110 --> 06:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
religious belief in there
 
06:17:39.110 --> 06:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:17:39.120 --> 06:17:40.070 align:start position:0%
thank you um
so

06:17:40.070 --> 06:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:17:43.590 --> 06:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
um i i i ended up having to get deep
 
06:17:46.310 --> 06:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
into the dirt on hb2 so i'm more
 
06:17:48.868 --> 06:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
familiar with it than most
 
06:17:50.628 --> 06:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
there was
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
you may recall a tremendous amount of
 
06:17:55.190 --> 06:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
debate last spring around divisive
 
06:17:55.200 --> 06:17:57.110 align:start position:0%
debate last spring around divisive
concepts

06:17:57.110 --> 06:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
concepts
 
06:17:59.030 --> 06:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think something brilliant happened
 
06:18:00.548 --> 06:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
somebody realized that the whole
 
06:18:04.230 --> 06:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
divisive concept approach was asking for
 
06:18:06.548 --> 06:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
a constitutional challenge
 
06:18:09.030 --> 06:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
and somebody said okay rather than
 
06:18:11.190 --> 06:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
pitching it the way we're pitching it
 
06:18:15.110 --> 06:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's insert it in hb2 to
 
06:18:18.390 --> 06:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
say that students are should be free
 
06:18:20.230 --> 06:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
from discrimination
 
06:18:20.240 --> 06:18:21.350 align:start position:0%
from discrimination
in

06:18:21.350 --> 06:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:18:23.030 --> 06:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
their education
 
06:18:26.150 --> 06:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
so so like for example if
 
06:18:27.510 --> 06:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
if a teacher
 
06:18:30.230 --> 06:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
were to provide a worksheet that said
 
06:18:32.788 --> 06:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
you know something about
 
06:18:36.470 --> 06:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
x race being ugly and why race being
 
06:18:36.480 --> 06:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
x race being ugly and why race being
pretty

06:18:37.510 --> 06:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
06:18:39.670 --> 06:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know that sort of thing has happened
 
06:18:41.350 --> 06:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
06:18:43.190 --> 06:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
06:18:45.510 --> 06:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
illegal under our current law
 
06:18:48.390 --> 06:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
and and so i would just add religious
 
06:18:50.230 --> 06:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
beliefs to that
 
06:18:51.990 --> 06:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
segment because
 
06:18:55.030 --> 06:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
it leverages the same sort of litany of
 
06:18:57.430 --> 06:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
protected classes that are found in
 
06:18:57.440 --> 06:18:59.590 align:start position:0%
protected classes that are found in
354-a

06:18:59.590 --> 06:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
354-a
 
06:18:59.600 --> 06:19:00.468 align:start position:0%
354-a
so

06:19:00.468 --> 06:19:00.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:19:02.788 --> 06:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
we when when that got put together it
 
06:19:05.510 --> 06:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
was meant to be consistent with the the
 
06:19:08.310 --> 06:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
civil rights section
 
06:19:10.070 --> 06:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
06:19:13.110 --> 06:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay and if you if you want i i can it's
 
06:19:15.270 --> 06:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
i've found the hb2 language multiple
 
06:19:17.670 --> 06:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
times i can i can pull it out and email
 
06:19:18.948 --> 06:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
it to you
 
06:19:21.510 --> 06:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
i can't seem to find it in the rsas but
 
06:19:23.670 --> 06:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
i can find it in hb2 so i don't know if
 
06:19:26.070 --> 06:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's still in process or what but and
 
06:19:29.990 --> 06:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
then i do have one other comment to make
 
06:19:31.590 --> 06:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
as a member of the fiscal committee
 
06:19:33.110 --> 06:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
we've been improving
 
06:19:34.720 --> 06:19:34.730 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to help
 
06:19:34.730 --> 06:19:35.830 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to help
[Music]

06:19:35.830 --> 06:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:19:38.548 --> 06:19:38.558 align:start position:0%
with refugee support
 
06:19:41.750 --> 06:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
and uh so we're we're bringing in at
 
06:19:45.670 --> 06:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
least 240 afghanis um
 
06:19:48.868 --> 06:19:48.878 align:start position:0%
generally um you know 90
 
06:19:52.150 --> 06:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
95 or more percent are
 
06:19:52.160 --> 06:19:53.270 align:start position:0%
95 or more percent are
muslim

06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
muslim
 
06:19:56.708 --> 06:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
and and so i i i i think making sure
 
06:19:59.350 --> 06:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
that we're a state tolerant and of
 
06:20:01.190 --> 06:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs and the differences
 
06:20:03.270 --> 06:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
between religious beliefs would be
 
06:20:06.390 --> 06:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
another good way of just um
 
06:20:10.468 --> 06:20:10.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.548 --> 06:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
06:20:15.830 --> 06:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative horgan
 
06:20:18.310 --> 06:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
this is just a point of information just
 
06:20:20.468 --> 06:20:20.478 align:start position:0%
that i've found a lot of the bills we
 
06:20:20.478 --> 06:20:22.548 align:start position:0%
that i've found a lot of the bills we
passed

06:20:22.548 --> 06:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
passed
 
06:20:23.670 --> 06:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:20:25.510 --> 06:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
are reflected if you go through the
 
06:20:27.750 --> 06:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
browse titles they're reflected if you
 
06:20:29.270 --> 06:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
look at the whole uh
 
06:20:32.708 --> 06:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
chapter but the individual
 
06:20:35.350 --> 06:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
but the index is not as up-to-date so
 
06:20:37.350 --> 06:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
some of the individual files were
 
06:20:39.590 --> 06:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
probably physically on the system but
 
06:20:41.830 --> 06:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
the index that produces the
 
06:20:41.840 --> 06:20:42.788 align:start position:0%
the index that produces the
uh

06:20:42.788 --> 06:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:20:44.468 --> 06:20:44.478 align:start position:0%
the menu with all just the individual
 
06:20:46.310 --> 06:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
titles and click on that seems to be
 
06:20:48.868 --> 06:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
lagging behind but you can get better
 
06:20:50.548 --> 06:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
results if you uh
 
06:20:52.670 --> 06:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
like for example if you look the whole
 
06:20:55.270 --> 06:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
rsa-54a i believe those would be in
 
06:20:57.590 --> 06:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
there which is uh one of the
 
06:21:01.990 --> 06:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
rsas that hb2 event did last year so
 
06:21:04.150 --> 06:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
that that's that's true representative i
 
06:21:06.548 --> 06:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
but i i think the education stuff went
 
06:21:08.468 --> 06:21:08.478 align:start position:0%
over into the education section of the
 
06:21:10.548 --> 06:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
rsa oh of course yes
 
06:21:10.558 --> 06:21:11.670 align:start position:0%
rsa oh of course yes
thanks

06:21:11.670 --> 06:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
06:21:15.270 --> 06:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:17.030 --> 06:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for
 
06:21:18.548 --> 06:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
answering my other question i appreciate
 
06:21:19.990 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
that it's helpful
 
06:21:20.000 --> 06:21:20.868 align:start position:0%
that it's helpful
um

06:21:20.868 --> 06:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:22.868 --> 06:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts about that
 
06:21:24.948 --> 06:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
about language about religious belief
 
06:21:26.868 --> 06:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
and practice or religious belief or
 
06:21:28.628 --> 06:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
practice and not just
 
06:21:33.190 --> 06:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
belief i think that gets to a broader um
 
06:21:35.590 --> 06:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
encompassing more religions than
 
06:21:38.230 --> 06:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
christianity and islam
 
06:21:41.750 --> 06:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
i i i i don't have anything specific to
 
06:21:44.548 --> 06:21:44.558 align:start position:0%
answer to your question in in general
 
06:21:47.670 --> 06:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
i would say the point
 
06:21:47.680 --> 06:21:48.868 align:start position:0%
i would say the point
of

06:21:48.868 --> 06:21:48.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:21:51.430 --> 06:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
our recognizing different religious
 
06:21:54.468 --> 06:21:54.478 align:start position:0%
beliefs is to be tolerant and inclusive
 
06:21:56.070 --> 06:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
06:22:00.230 --> 06:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate a definition that was
 
06:22:03.430 --> 06:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
flexible and more broadly applied
 
06:22:03.440 --> 06:22:04.468 align:start position:0%
flexible and more broadly applied
but

06:22:04.468 --> 06:22:04.478 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:22:06.868 --> 06:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer so i don't know what
 
06:22:09.350 --> 06:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
trouble you walk into when you use
 
06:22:11.910 --> 06:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
excessive definitions
 
06:22:14.948 --> 06:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that
 
06:22:17.590 --> 06:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:22:33.030 --> 06:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:35.350 --> 06:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
06:22:36.788 --> 06:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
the committee i don't think i've been in
 
06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
front of your committee before so i'd
 
06:22:40.948 --> 06:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
like to introduce myself paula minihan's
 
06:22:42.468 --> 06:22:42.478 align:start position:0%
senior vice president state government
 
06:22:44.070 --> 06:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
relations for the new hampshire hospital
 
06:22:44.080 --> 06:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
relations for the new hampshire hospital
association

06:22:45.430 --> 06:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
association
 
06:22:47.910 --> 06:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
representing all 26 acute care hospitals
 
06:22:50.230 --> 06:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
as well as our specialty hospitals i had
 
06:22:52.070 --> 06:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
written testimony and i will follow up
 
06:22:54.230 --> 06:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
with written testimony or notes for the
 
06:22:56.390 --> 06:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee but after hearing the
 
06:22:58.708 --> 06:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill
 
06:23:01.750 --> 06:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
my my testimony changed this bill was
 
06:23:04.150 --> 06:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
confusing to us but
 
06:23:05.990 --> 06:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine
 
06:23:08.948 --> 06:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
there are many many many bills this year
 
06:23:11.750 --> 06:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
related to vaccine related bills and
 
06:23:13.270 --> 06:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
this is one of them
 
06:23:17.670 --> 06:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
it was um and the term that the
 
06:23:20.628 --> 06:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
sponsor used that convinced me that this
 
06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
is another attempt to try to
 
06:23:27.750 --> 06:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
be more vague and confusing relative to
 
06:23:29.910 --> 06:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions relative to vaccine
 
06:23:31.990 --> 06:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
requirements has to do with using the
 
06:23:35.430 --> 06:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
word conscientious or conscious
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's conscientious objection many of the
 
06:23:39.670 --> 06:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
bills this year some in front of your
 
06:23:39.680 --> 06:23:40.628 align:start position:0%
bills this year some in front of your
committee

06:23:40.628 --> 06:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:23:41.910 --> 06:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
06:23:44.788 --> 06:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
that use that term i just want to be on
 
06:23:47.030 --> 06:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
the record the hospitals in new
 
06:23:49.830 --> 06:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire allow for exemptions they have
 
06:23:52.948 --> 06:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
mandate requirements for vaccines
 
06:23:55.270 --> 06:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
they have always allowed for exemptions
 
06:23:55.280 --> 06:23:56.468 align:start position:0%
they have always allowed for exemptions
for

06:23:56.468 --> 06:23:56.478 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:23:58.390 --> 06:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
medical and religious
 
06:24:00.948 --> 06:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
reasons there is a process
 
06:24:03.590 --> 06:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
some may see it as onerous
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
but it is a fair
 
06:24:06.868 --> 06:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
process that is
 
06:24:09.750 --> 06:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
done by the human resources department
 
06:24:13.350 --> 06:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
and is respectful of everyone's beliefs
 
06:24:15.510 --> 06:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
and and but they need to go through a
 
06:24:17.270 --> 06:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
process to be fair
 
06:24:19.750 --> 06:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
so by adding conscientious objection
 
06:24:24.070 --> 06:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
which we believe this bill tries to do
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
then it is makes it too vague and i
 
06:24:28.948 --> 06:24:28.958 align:start position:0%
think representative simpson was getting
 
06:24:32.070 --> 06:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
right at that question the other um
 
06:24:33.990 --> 06:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
asking representative edwards i think
 
06:24:37.350 --> 06:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's too vague and um and
 
06:24:39.350 --> 06:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the current statute when it has
 
06:24:41.670 --> 06:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
creed in there that does if you look at
 
06:24:43.510 --> 06:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
the definition of creed it's really it's
 
06:24:46.230 --> 06:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
related to religion so i don't know that
 
06:24:48.708 --> 06:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually necessary i think
 
06:24:51.110 --> 06:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
it confuses the issue too much
 
06:24:54.070 --> 06:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
what does what it did um point out to me
 
06:24:56.628 --> 06:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
and i am not a lawyer by any means nor
 
06:24:58.628 --> 06:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
do i really know um
 
06:25:00.948 --> 06:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
much about the um commission who i mean
 
06:25:02.230 --> 06:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
i know about the commission on human
 
06:25:04.230 --> 06:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
rights but that is not my area of
 
06:25:06.948 --> 06:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
expertise of course um but
 
06:25:09.190 --> 06:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
it um
 
06:25:11.910 --> 06:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
what you find by going through all these
 
06:25:14.628 --> 06:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
statutes is that we don't have a lot of
 
06:25:17.030 --> 06:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
consistency sometimes we say religion
 
06:25:19.750 --> 06:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes we say creed sometimes the
 
06:25:22.948 --> 06:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
statute says religious creed but to put
 
06:25:26.070 --> 06:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs in a statute
 
06:25:28.628 --> 06:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
i believe would cause a lot of confusion
 
06:25:30.390 --> 06:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
and would would
 
06:25:32.948 --> 06:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
make it very very very difficult if not
 
06:25:35.110 --> 06:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
impossible to
 
06:25:38.070 --> 06:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
continue to have appropriate fair
 
06:25:38.080 --> 06:25:39.430 align:start position:0%
continue to have appropriate fair
exemptions

06:25:39.430 --> 06:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
06:25:42.150 --> 06:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
for employees that request those
 
06:25:43.590 --> 06:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
06:25:44.868 --> 06:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
06:25:48.548 --> 06:25:48.558 align:start position:0%
a vaccination requirement um so
 
06:25:51.590 --> 06:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
with that i um i will
 
06:25:53.670 --> 06:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
end my testimony we are opposed to this
 
06:25:55.430 --> 06:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill we think it's confusing and
 
06:25:57.910 --> 06:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and i'm happy to answer any
 
06:25:57.920 --> 06:25:59.830 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and i'm happy to answer any
questions

06:25:59.830 --> 06:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:26:03.830 --> 06:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:05.350 --> 06:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
06:26:07.030 --> 06:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
again thank you for your testimony today
 
06:26:08.070 --> 06:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
06:26:22.310 --> 06:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:24.070 --> 06:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
is this on
 
06:26:25.590 --> 06:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you so much for the
 
06:26:28.868 --> 06:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today my name is
 
06:26:30.868 --> 06:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
frank knack i'm the policy director with
 
06:26:33.430 --> 06:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
the aclu of new hampshire
 
06:26:36.548 --> 06:26:36.558 align:start position:0%
um we are at this point at least neutral
 
06:26:38.468 --> 06:26:38.478 align:start position:0%
it was helpful to get more information
 
06:26:40.948 --> 06:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
from the bill sponsor about the intent
 
06:26:43.030 --> 06:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
we are still like the previous speaker
 
06:26:45.750 --> 06:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
confused about the intent of this bill
 
06:26:48.628 --> 06:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
um and just to kind of go over a few a
 
06:26:50.708 --> 06:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
few of the issues that that raised flags
 
06:26:52.150 --> 06:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
for us
 
06:26:54.150 --> 06:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
most of the laws that this bill is
 
06:26:56.548 --> 06:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
amending already have protections for
 
06:26:59.510 --> 06:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
religion or creed in law for example
 
06:27:01.430 --> 06:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
under our law against discrimination an
 
06:27:03.430 --> 06:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
employer who adopts a mandatory vaccine
 
06:27:03.440 --> 06:27:04.390 align:start position:0%
employer who adopts a mandatory vaccine
policy

06:27:04.390 --> 06:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
policy
 
06:27:06.628 --> 06:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
already is required to make efforts to
 
06:27:08.548 --> 06:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
accommodate employees
 
06:27:10.468 --> 06:27:10.478 align:start position:0%
whose religious objections
 
06:27:11.910 --> 06:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
who have religious objections to
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
becoming vaccinated similarly title vii
 
06:27:15.270 --> 06:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:27:17.590 --> 06:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
federal civil rights act of 64 which
 
06:27:19.110 --> 06:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
prohibits discrimination based on
 
06:27:19.120 --> 06:27:20.708 align:start position:0%
prohibits discrimination based on
religion

06:27:20.708 --> 06:27:20.718 align:start position:0%
religion
 
06:27:22.150 --> 06:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
an employer is required to provide
 
06:27:24.390 --> 06:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
employees with the right to request an
 
06:27:26.708 --> 06:27:26.718 align:start position:0%
exception to the vaccine requirement a
 
06:27:28.310 --> 06:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable exception the standard is
 
06:27:29.670 --> 06:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation if there's not
 
06:27:32.070 --> 06:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
an undue burden
 
06:27:34.468 --> 06:27:34.478 align:start position:0%
adding to our concern is you know other
 
06:27:37.270 --> 06:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
ways that this bill if enacted
 
06:27:39.350 --> 06:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
could be used to harm people
 
06:27:39.360 --> 06:27:40.868 align:start position:0%
could be used to harm people
particularly

06:27:40.868 --> 06:27:40.878 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
06:27:42.310 --> 06:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
people seeking reproductive health care
 
06:27:45.430 --> 06:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
services lgbtq plus people for example
 
06:27:47.270 --> 06:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill could an employer take
 
06:27:49.110 --> 06:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
action against an employee who refuses
 
06:27:50.788 --> 06:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
on religious grounds to provide or sell
 
06:27:52.548 --> 06:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
birth control condoms or fulfill a
 
06:27:54.548 --> 06:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
medical prescription for reproductive
 
06:27:57.030 --> 06:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
health care it is unclear
 
06:27:58.708 --> 06:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
further under this bill could employees
 
06:28:00.468 --> 06:28:00.478 align:start position:0%
be prevented from being able to comply
 
06:28:02.628 --> 06:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
with non-discrimination laws because
 
06:28:04.868 --> 06:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
they have an employee who may hold
 
06:28:06.390 --> 06:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs that they are not
 
06:28:08.788 --> 06:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
going to be nice or you know not respect
 
06:28:11.590 --> 06:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus people again unclear into
 
06:28:13.350 --> 06:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
this law and so those are questions that
 
06:28:15.030 --> 06:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
we have serious concerns about we hope
 
06:28:16.868 --> 06:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
the committee will look into that
 
06:28:20.230 --> 06:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:22.390 --> 06:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
06:28:24.548 --> 06:28:24.558 align:start position:0%
yes representative walper
 
06:28:27.510 --> 06:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
so uh the confusion to which you refer
 
06:28:27.520 --> 06:28:29.310 align:start position:0%
so uh the confusion to which you refer
about

06:28:29.310 --> 06:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:28:31.270 --> 06:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
lgbtq or
 
06:28:34.948 --> 06:28:34.958 align:start position:0%
i forget which else you mentioned
 
06:28:37.430 --> 06:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
does that not exist already
 
06:28:39.830 --> 06:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
we have uh protections in law this law
 
06:28:42.788 --> 06:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
would add confusion to that and so we're
 
06:28:47.990 --> 06:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
so i'm just i'm trying to understand how
 
06:28:52.868 --> 06:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
it would add confusion
 
06:28:55.030 --> 06:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh you are adding in in terms and
 
06:28:57.750 --> 06:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
concepts that are unclear in this i mean
 
06:29:00.070 --> 06:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
as the last speaker mentioned
 
06:29:01.510 --> 06:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
there's lack of clarity on what the
 
06:29:03.190 --> 06:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
intent of this law is trying to do we
 
06:29:04.708 --> 06:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
have clarity right now under new
 
06:29:07.270 --> 06:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire law to protect lgbtq plus
 
06:29:09.910 --> 06:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
people this would add um uncertainty to
 
06:29:11.830 --> 06:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
that at a minimum and so we think that
 
06:29:13.190 --> 06:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
the committee should look into that more
 
06:29:17.990 --> 06:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:20.708 --> 06:29:20.718 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
06:29:22.310 --> 06:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
06:29:23.990 --> 06:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:29:25.270 --> 06:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
06:29:30.948 --> 06:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:33.270 --> 06:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair yep i'm going to ask you to
 
06:29:35.190 --> 06:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
fill out a pink card when you're done
 
06:29:37.590 --> 06:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes i will turn that in
 
06:29:39.990 --> 06:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm not testifying in favor or in
 
06:29:42.948 --> 06:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
opposition to this but i just wanted to

wanted to point out to the committee
 
06:29:59.590 --> 06:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
that the language dictates of his own
 
06:30:02.070 --> 06:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
conscience comes directly from the new
 
06:30:05.430 --> 06:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution part 1 article 5
 
06:30:07.830 --> 06:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
and it appears to be being added into

the statutory protections of rsa 354 but
 
06:30:13.830 --> 06:30:13.840 align:start position:0%

worship as well as practice and that's
 
06:30:29.430 --> 06:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
holding of the mac decision it does

that's in education
 
06:39:25.510 --> 06:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
for the last five six years in my
 
06:39:29.270 --> 06:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
district the school board um has
 
06:39:32.230 --> 06:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
been denying people any public comment
 
06:39:33.750 --> 06:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
what they've been doing is putting their
 
06:39:35.670 --> 06:39:35.680 align:start position:0%

meeting
 
06:39:38.548 --> 06:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
meaning just like here
 
06:39:41.110 --> 06:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
when we have legislation coming forward
 
06:39:42.788 --> 06:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
which is their agenda that they're going
 
06:39:45.430 --> 06:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
forward with we are we let people come
 
06:39:47.270 --> 06:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
in and testify and speak against that
 
06:39:47.280 --> 06:39:48.708 align:start position:0%
in and testify and speak against that
legislation

06:39:48.708 --> 06:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:39:50.868 --> 06:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
uh either for or against
 
06:39:53.430 --> 06:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
well in the school board in my district
 
06:39:54.708 --> 06:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
you have to wait until they already
 
06:39:56.628 --> 06:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
passed it before you can say anything
 
06:39:58.708 --> 06:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
before you can address any of the gender
 
06:40:01.270 --> 06:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
items and a lot of times it's 10 30 11
 
06:40:03.350 --> 06:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock at night and the people of the
 
06:40:05.030 --> 06:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
district are already gone
 
06:40:06.628 --> 06:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh they're home
 
06:40:08.150 --> 06:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
they if they're waiting there they've
 
06:40:09.510 --> 06:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
got their kids on their lap and
 
06:40:11.430 --> 06:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
everything else while they're waiting to
 
06:40:13.430 --> 06:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
speak on the agenda item that they had
 
06:40:16.390 --> 06:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
already passed and it does no good
 
06:40:16.400 --> 06:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
already passed and it does no good
so

06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:40:17.520 --> 06:40:18.390 align:start position:0%
so
i

06:40:18.390 --> 06:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:40:21.590 --> 06:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
was more than happy to endorse this with
 
06:40:23.670 --> 06:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative dolan who was on the
 
06:40:26.310 --> 06:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
council in my committee because at times
 
06:40:28.868 --> 06:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
there was uh chairman on the council
 
06:40:31.030 --> 06:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
did the same thing that waited to the
 
06:40:32.708 --> 06:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
end of the day and then i hear this is
 
06:40:34.548 --> 06:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
going but to the representatives
 
06:40:36.548 --> 06:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
throughout the state this is happening
 
06:40:38.310 --> 06:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
all over the state
 
06:40:41.510 --> 06:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
and this is a 91a issue we have the
 
06:40:44.310 --> 06:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
right the people especially parents with
 
06:40:45.990 --> 06:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
the kids in school have the right to
 
06:40:48.310 --> 06:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
speak and it should be done in the
 
06:40:51.190 --> 06:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
beginning before any votes are done on
 
06:40:53.030 --> 06:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
agenda items
 
06:40:55.030 --> 06:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
which is same thing as legislation that
 
06:40:57.510 --> 06:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
we do parents have a right to be part of
 
06:40:58.628 --> 06:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
it um
 
06:40:58.638 --> 06:40:59.990 align:start position:0%
it um
and

06:40:59.990 --> 06:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:02.230 --> 06:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
so this is why why i got involved in it
 
06:41:04.390 --> 06:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
because i was called in from flew in
 
06:41:05.670 --> 06:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
from florida
 
06:41:07.510 --> 06:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
because the parents were aggravated in
 
06:41:09.270 --> 06:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
my district and asked me to come home
 
06:41:10.708 --> 06:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
and speak for them
 
06:41:12.230 --> 06:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
in which i did i went to the school
 
06:41:14.788 --> 06:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
board and it was like about 10 30 11
 
06:41:16.150 --> 06:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
o'clock at night i had to be here the
 
06:41:19.590 --> 06:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
next morning but i stuck it out and
 
06:41:21.510 --> 06:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know and spoke for them
 
06:41:23.350 --> 06:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
on behalf of them having the opportunity
 
06:41:25.350 --> 06:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
to speak and i even told the school
 
06:41:27.670 --> 06:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
board if you will not give the people
 
06:41:29.270 --> 06:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
the right to speak
 
06:41:32.230 --> 06:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
we all work for the people okay and they
 
06:41:33.750 --> 06:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
have every right
 
06:41:35.910 --> 06:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
to uh re it's basically like a redress
 
06:41:37.990 --> 06:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
of grievance constitutional issue in my
 
06:41:38.000 --> 06:41:38.948 align:start position:0%
of grievance constitutional issue in my
opinion

06:41:38.948 --> 06:41:38.958 align:start position:0%

to redressing you know their um you know
 
06:41:44.628 --> 06:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
boards that are elected by the people
 
06:41:46.868 --> 06:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:41:49.910 --> 06:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
tom dolan who is familiar with it also
 
06:41:52.070 --> 06:41:52.080 align:start position:0%

06:42:37.030 --> 06:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
that they have no right to speak and are
 
06:42:39.190 --> 06:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
excluded from testifying before a local
 
06:42:39.200 --> 06:42:40.230 align:start position:0%

municipal
meeting

06:42:41.750 --> 06:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
06:42:44.830 --> 06:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
this exclusion has frustrated our fellow
 
06:42:47.910 --> 06:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
citizens as they attempt to engage with
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
their local government while some
 
06:42:52.070 --> 06:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
political entities conduct public
 
06:42:52.080 --> 06:42:53.270 align:start position:0%
political entities conduct public
comments

06:42:53.270 --> 06:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
comments
 
06:42:56.468 --> 06:42:56.478 align:start position:0%
several delegates this period
 
06:42:58.548 --> 06:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
to the end of the meeting this is
 
06:43:01.190 --> 06:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
nothing more than a cynical attempt to
 
06:43:03.430 --> 06:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
home in uh the interested
 
06:43:06.070 --> 06:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
speaker won't wait several hours to say
 
06:43:08.948 --> 06:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
two or three lines about a local issue
 
06:43:11.270 --> 06:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
in other words it should be respectfully
 
06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
held at the start of the meeting
 
06:43:15.670 --> 06:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
the requirement is to conduct a public
 
06:43:17.510 --> 06:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
comment period at the beginning of the
 
06:43:19.990 --> 06:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
meeting for at least 15 minutes unless
 
06:43:22.548 --> 06:43:22.558 align:start position:0%
there are no additional citizens wishing
 
06:43:23.590 --> 06:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
06:43:25.830 --> 06:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
the meeting chair may always extend the
 
06:43:28.390 --> 06:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
period as they determine appropriate
 
06:43:30.548 --> 06:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
representative tom dolan
 
06:43:33.830 --> 06:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
this is a no-brainer because what makes
 
06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
the people and i've seen it in my own
 
06:43:37.830 --> 06:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
eyes in my district what makes them mad
 
06:43:39.990 --> 06:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
and get excited the people because when
 
06:43:42.628 --> 06:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
you deny them their right to speak out
 
06:43:45.350 --> 06:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
on an agenda in the school or in a town
 
06:43:47.830 --> 06:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
issue or or a planning board issue and
 
06:43:49.670 --> 06:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
you shut them down
 
06:43:51.990 --> 06:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
and you know these are taxpayers
 
06:43:55.190 --> 06:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and they deserve every right to speak
 
06:43:58.310 --> 06:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
out you know whether it's good or bad
 
06:43:59.990 --> 06:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
but in the news they make it sound like
 
06:44:01.910 --> 06:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're bad bad people
 
06:44:03.350 --> 06:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know and they want to fight the
 
06:44:05.030 --> 06:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
system and they're calling them names
 
06:44:07.350 --> 06:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
and this and that but i watched the
 
06:44:08.868 --> 06:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
school board
 
06:44:10.948 --> 06:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
where a parent asked a question i said i
 
06:44:13.350 --> 06:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
went to the superintendent i went to the
 
06:44:16.150 --> 06:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
teachers i went to the principal and
 
06:44:18.708 --> 06:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
nobody has given me an answer yet so now
 
06:44:21.030 --> 06:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
they go to the board and the board would
 
06:44:23.910 --> 06:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
not answer them oh we'll answer an email
 
06:44:25.190 --> 06:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
and they said well that's why i'm here
 
06:44:27.270 --> 06:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
nobody's answering my emails or or
 
06:44:29.030 --> 06:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
giving me the answers
 
06:44:31.110 --> 06:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
so they really treat them bad naturally
 
06:44:33.350 --> 06:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
the mother gets all excited and mad
 
06:44:35.670 --> 06:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
because you won't listen to them and
 
06:44:37.590 --> 06:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
this is causing problems you know
 
06:44:39.030 --> 06:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole state we have to
 
06:44:42.070 --> 06:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
fix this and i'm a local control guy
 
06:44:44.230 --> 06:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
but when local control guy you know
 
06:44:46.230 --> 06:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
local control breaks down
 
06:44:47.990 --> 06:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature we're not we're not a
 
06:44:50.468 --> 06:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
home rule state we're at dillon state so
 
06:44:53.270 --> 06:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
the legislator is given the authority to
 
06:44:55.350 --> 06:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
tell the cities and towns
 
06:44:57.350 --> 06:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is what you know it can be done
 
06:44:59.510 --> 06:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
what can't be done and we owe it to the
 
06:45:01.830 --> 06:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire to fix this once
 
06:45:04.628 --> 06:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
and for all and i'll take any questions
 
06:45:09.750 --> 06:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:11.750 --> 06:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
i do have one one question i think and
 
06:45:13.830 --> 06:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:45:13.840 --> 06:45:14.628 align:start position:0%
that is
it

06:45:14.628 --> 06:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:45:16.628 --> 06:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
and you you reference the fact that we
 
06:45:18.948 --> 06:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
give people opportunity to speak on
 
06:45:21.270 --> 06:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
on what we're going to be doing here and
 
06:45:23.430 --> 06:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's true
 
06:45:25.430 --> 06:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
the question i have
 
06:45:25.440 --> 06:45:26.468 align:start position:0%
the question i have
is

06:45:26.468 --> 06:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:45:27.590 --> 06:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
should that
 
06:45:28.948 --> 06:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
time period at the beginning of the
 
06:45:31.430 --> 06:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
meeting be relevant should it
 
06:45:33.430 --> 06:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
should people be given the opportunity
 
06:45:36.230 --> 06:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
to speak about what's on the agenda
 
06:45:38.948 --> 06:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just come in and
 
06:45:41.510 --> 06:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
express any type of gripe that they have
 
06:45:42.948 --> 06:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the meeting and take
 
06:45:44.868 --> 06:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
the time to do that the if it's a school
 
06:45:46.788 --> 06:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
board or council meeting
 
06:45:48.310 --> 06:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
they should be able to go in there and
 
06:45:50.468 --> 06:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
gripe i mean i get calls about trash and
 
06:45:52.548 --> 06:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
i tell people i don't do trash gotta go
 
06:45:55.190 --> 06:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
to the council you know or you know an
 
06:45:57.750 --> 06:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
area in a certain area there they should
 
06:45:59.350 --> 06:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
be able to go there and address the
 
06:46:02.390 --> 06:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
council and address the school board um
 
06:46:05.750 --> 06:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's i mean this is a a no-brainer and i
 
06:46:07.670 --> 06:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
think we would silence a lot of people
 
06:46:10.708 --> 06:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
into in the state and put them at ease
 
06:46:13.030 --> 06:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
because now they know
 
06:46:15.510 --> 06:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
the door's open for them it's not shot
 
06:46:18.310 --> 06:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:20.948 --> 06:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
06:46:23.910 --> 06:46:23.920 align:start position:0%

06:46:26.868 --> 06:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you mr
 
06:46:28.708 --> 06:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
representative bill cerro for taking my
 
06:46:31.190 --> 06:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
question i wondered did the school board
 
06:46:33.430 --> 06:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
have any rational reason
 
06:46:35.830 --> 06:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
for why they did this
 
06:46:38.230 --> 06:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay any experience that that's that's a
 
06:46:39.430 --> 06:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
great question
 
06:46:42.310 --> 06:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
we have um one who is a chair
 
06:46:43.830 --> 06:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee and she's the one
 
06:46:45.110 --> 06:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's already
 
06:46:47.270 --> 06:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
started about five years ago
 
06:46:49.190 --> 06:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and she didn't run for re-election
 
06:46:51.190 --> 06:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
there but what happened is two board
 
06:46:53.830 --> 06:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
members resigned so the boards brought
 
06:46:55.750 --> 06:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
her back on and then you know all of a
 
06:46:56.948 --> 06:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
sudden now the
 
06:46:58.708 --> 06:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
the uh public comments are at the end of
 
06:47:01.030 --> 06:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
the meeting so i asked her why why would
 
06:47:03.910 --> 06:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
you do that well we're not a um a
 
06:47:05.510 --> 06:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
meeting for the people we're doing the
 
06:47:07.030 --> 06:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
people's business
 
06:47:08.230 --> 06:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
well if the people you're doing the
 
06:47:09.830 --> 06:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
people's business then
 
06:47:11.670 --> 06:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know you should let them
 
06:47:14.310 --> 06:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
add to uh or you know question
 
06:47:16.548 --> 06:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
on certain agenda items and things like
 
06:47:19.430 --> 06:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
that but she she didn't think and the
 
06:47:21.990 --> 06:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent agreed with me uh because
 
06:47:23.510 --> 06:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
he said you know you're right this is a
 
06:47:25.030 --> 06:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
06:47:26.788 --> 06:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
for the good of the people we owe it to
 
06:47:28.310 --> 06:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
them but but
 
06:47:29.510 --> 06:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
the board
 
06:47:32.548 --> 06:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
voted there to say no and they put it uh
 
06:47:33.990 --> 06:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
the public comments at the end of the
 
06:47:34.000 --> 06:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
the public comments at the end of the
meeting

06:47:35.990 --> 06:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
06:47:37.910 --> 06:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:47:40.868 --> 06:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
other questions representative lorenzo
 
06:47:42.310 --> 06:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:47:43.670 --> 06:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question to representative
 
06:47:46.310 --> 06:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
balducero you know i'm thinking about um
 
06:47:46.320 --> 06:47:47.430 align:start position:0%
balducero you know i'm thinking about um
how

06:47:47.430 --> 06:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:47:50.548 --> 06:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
meetings um are conducted and
 
06:47:52.390 --> 06:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
there's an agenda
 
06:47:55.270 --> 06:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then um there's like questions and
 
06:47:57.910 --> 06:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
answers at the end um if we put the
 
06:48:00.230 --> 06:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions and answer the questions at
 
06:48:01.750 --> 06:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
06:48:05.430 --> 06:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:07.270 --> 06:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
mess with the agenda
 
06:48:08.868 --> 06:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh well why would the people show up
 
06:48:11.270 --> 06:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
then if you're already gonna pass it and
 
06:48:13.830 --> 06:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
they have no say why even show
 
06:48:15.510 --> 06:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
why why come to a school board meeting
 
06:48:17.430 --> 06:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
with tom meeting if they're gonna wait
 
06:48:18.868 --> 06:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
until at the end after they already
 
06:48:21.830 --> 06:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
voted on everything to speak
 
06:48:23.670 --> 06:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
makes no sense to me i'd say just stay
 
06:48:25.830 --> 06:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
home and say i'm wasting my time may i
 
06:48:27.270 --> 06:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:48:29.670 --> 06:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
well because i i think that the
 
06:48:31.910 --> 06:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
officials would be explaining you know
 
06:48:32.948 --> 06:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
through the agenda they would be
 
06:48:35.110 --> 06:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
explaining the steps they're taking or
 
06:48:36.310 --> 06:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know whatever whatever they're
 
06:48:38.150 --> 06:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
working on um
 
06:48:41.190 --> 06:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that would be information for
 
06:48:42.628 --> 06:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
the citizens
 
06:48:44.150 --> 06:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
so then they can
 
06:48:45.670 --> 06:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
give the
 
06:48:45.680 --> 06:48:47.430 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:48:49.110 --> 06:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
the council or
 
06:48:51.510 --> 06:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
all demand their their feedback
 
06:48:53.110 --> 06:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
no i hear what you're saying but that's
 
06:48:55.270 --> 06:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
a form of government control that's a
 
06:48:56.708 --> 06:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
form of shutting down the people and say
 
06:48:58.150 --> 06:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
we don't care what you say we're going
 
06:48:59.350 --> 06:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
to pass it then if you want to say
 
06:49:00.788 --> 06:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
something about it later it's too late
 
06:49:02.788 --> 06:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
we already passed it okay thank you

that yeah i love when a plane comes
together

06:49:29.750 --> 06:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:32.948 --> 06:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:49:34.948 --> 06:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
representative simpson thank you mr
 
06:49:37.110 --> 06:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:49:37.120 --> 06:49:38.230 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
um

06:49:38.230 --> 06:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:39.910 --> 06:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
so i
 
06:49:42.628 --> 06:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
definitely experienced in our sau having
 
06:49:44.070 --> 06:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
the public comment period at the
 
06:49:46.708 --> 06:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
beginning so i i can see the value in
 
06:49:48.948 --> 06:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
that for sure um
 
06:49:50.948 --> 06:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering there are times when
 
06:49:53.910 --> 06:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
we've had the agenda in town where
 
06:49:58.150 --> 06:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
we'll try to make public comment um
 
06:50:00.230 --> 06:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
for a particular issue like at the time
 
06:50:02.150 --> 06:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
of that issue so that everybody knows
 
06:50:03.990 --> 06:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
when it's coming up as opposed to having
 
06:50:05.750 --> 06:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
all the public comment
 
06:50:07.590 --> 06:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
for for every ish every item on the
 
06:50:09.190 --> 06:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
agenda right at the beginning like
 
06:50:11.590 --> 06:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes it'll be held to the relevant
 
06:50:14.150 --> 06:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
to before the relevant conversation and
 
06:50:16.708 --> 06:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if there's
 
06:50:19.190 --> 06:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
any room in here for
 
06:50:19.200 --> 06:50:20.230 align:start position:0%
any room in here for
um

06:50:20.230 --> 06:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:23.430 --> 06:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility depending on what the town's
 
06:50:25.590 --> 06:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
needs are
 
06:50:27.670 --> 06:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
around the agenda i actually like that
 
06:50:29.110 --> 06:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know i mean that you speak up when
 
06:50:31.590 --> 06:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
the agenda comes up and that you have a
 
06:50:35.030 --> 06:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
public comment um but
 
06:50:36.310 --> 06:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i've seen it happen with the
 
06:50:38.230 --> 06:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
chairman in my town now it's pretty good
 
06:50:40.628 --> 06:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
guy there he's done that before and it
 
06:50:43.510 --> 06:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
has let people speak so it maybe it'd be
 
06:50:45.590 --> 06:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
ideal to put cop launch you know i mean
 
06:50:45.600 --> 06:50:46.468 align:start position:0%
ideal to put cop launch you know i mean
that

06:50:46.468 --> 06:50:46.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:50:48.150 --> 06:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
to you know to have public comment in
 
06:50:50.310 --> 06:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
the beginning of agenda but i hate to
 
06:50:52.948 --> 06:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
see him tie up if you've got a 15 agenda
 
06:50:56.150 --> 06:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
there and then tie up 20 minutes or 15
 
06:50:57.590 --> 06:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
minutes each time
 
06:50:59.590 --> 06:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
before the agenda versus getting it out
 
06:51:01.830 --> 06:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the open right in the beginning
 
06:51:03.430 --> 06:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's let's say they meet at
 
06:51:05.510 --> 06:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
seven by seven fifty seven thirty you're
 
06:51:07.510 --> 06:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
already moving in you can be done in
 
06:51:09.110 --> 06:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
your agenda
 
06:51:10.948 --> 06:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
so i mean i actually i like that way
 
06:51:13.350 --> 06:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
there but i think that could be a
 
06:51:17.670 --> 06:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:20.150 --> 06:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:51:24.468 --> 06:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you have a good day
 
06:51:37.510 --> 06:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:39.990 --> 06:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh chairman gordon thank
 
06:51:41.430 --> 06:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
you again members of the committee for
 
06:51:43.110 --> 06:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
the record barra christina from the new
 
06:51:45.430 --> 06:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire school boards association
 
06:51:48.948 --> 06:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to house bill 1195.
 
06:51:52.070 --> 06:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh to be clear our opposition is not
 
06:51:54.548 --> 06:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
about public comments and hsba certainly
 
06:51:56.868 --> 06:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
recommends to our school boards across
 
06:51:58.788 --> 06:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
the state that they do provide for a
 
06:52:00.548 --> 06:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
public comment period at some point
 
06:52:02.070 --> 06:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
during the meeting
 
06:52:03.670 --> 06:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
however we also recommend that there are
 
06:52:05.430 --> 06:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
some parameters
 
06:52:07.350 --> 06:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
within that public meeting that i'll or
 
06:52:09.270 --> 06:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
the public comment portion that i'll get
 
06:52:12.070 --> 06:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
to in a minute i'm looking at the bill
 
06:52:14.948 --> 06:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
line three all meetings of a public body
 
06:52:16.948 --> 06:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
open the public i'm reading the
 
06:52:20.628 --> 06:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
definition of a public body under rsa
 
06:52:24.948 --> 06:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
91 a 1 a paragraph 6
 
06:52:24.958 --> 06:52:25.670 align:start position:0%
91 a 1 a paragraph 6
a

06:52:25.670 --> 06:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:52:28.948 --> 06:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
public body means any of the following a
 
06:52:30.708 --> 06:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
the general court
 
06:52:32.150 --> 06:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
including executive sessions of
 
06:52:32.160 --> 06:52:33.270 align:start position:0%
including executive sessions of
committees

06:52:33.270 --> 06:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
committees
 
06:52:35.350 --> 06:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
this committee takes public testimony
 
06:52:37.430 --> 06:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
you do not take public comment this is a
 
06:52:39.670 --> 06:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
hearing this is not a meeting there are
 
06:52:41.750 --> 06:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
distinct legal differences between the
 
06:52:44.390 --> 06:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
two you have a budget hearing under rsa
 
06:52:47.110 --> 06:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
32 a hearing implies the public has a
 
06:52:48.788 --> 06:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
right to come and speak
 
06:52:51.350 --> 06:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
you have public hearings for bond issues
 
06:52:53.590 --> 06:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
under rsa i think it's 35 if i'm not
 
06:52:56.070 --> 06:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
mistaken so i just want to be clear that
 
06:52:57.590 --> 06:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
me having the opportunity to come and
 
06:52:59.510 --> 06:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
speak here is because it's a hearing not
 
06:53:01.270 --> 06:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
because it's a meeting if this were to
 
06:53:03.510 --> 06:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
pass this committee and every other
 
06:53:05.590 --> 06:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee within this building would
 
06:53:08.150 --> 06:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
have to have a public comment period
 
06:53:09.830 --> 06:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
before we actually got into the hearings
 
06:53:11.910 --> 06:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
and started talking about the bills
 
06:53:14.390 --> 06:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
um the second aspect to that is that you
 
06:53:17.030 --> 06:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
cannot i'm on line five and six
 
06:53:19.750 --> 06:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
shall not limit or censor the content of
 
06:53:22.230 --> 06:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh the public com of the public comment
 
06:53:24.070 --> 06:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
so when we're in a public hearing i'm
 
06:53:25.990 --> 06:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
only allowed to talk about this bill or
 
06:53:28.230 --> 06:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
issues that are germane to this bill if
 
06:53:30.868 --> 06:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
we are not censoring or limiting public
 
06:53:32.948 --> 06:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
comment i would be able to come in here
 
06:53:35.190 --> 06:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
and talk about anything that i wanted to
 
06:53:37.350 --> 06:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
the war in afghanistan
 
06:53:37.360 --> 06:53:38.310 align:start position:0%
the war in afghanistan
uh

06:53:38.310 --> 06:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:53:39.190 --> 06:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:53:41.590 --> 06:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
global warming you picked the topic i'd
 
06:53:42.788 --> 06:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
be able to come in and talk about it
 
06:53:44.548 --> 06:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
would not be germaine or relevant to the
 
06:53:47.270 --> 06:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
business of this of this of this uh of
 
06:53:48.868 --> 06:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
this body
 
06:53:52.390 --> 06:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
also the other concern nhsba has um on
 
06:53:54.948 --> 06:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
blind forts is the chairperson may
 
06:53:56.948 --> 06:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
develop the length of time for both
 
06:53:59.110 --> 06:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
total time and individual time through
 
06:54:01.270 --> 06:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
school board governance that's a school
 
06:54:03.190 --> 06:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
board policy it's not the chairperson
 
06:54:05.270 --> 06:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
that does that i suppose the board could
 
06:54:07.430 --> 06:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
delegate that to the board chair but we
 
06:54:10.548 --> 06:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
do it through a collective policy
 
06:54:13.030 --> 06:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
other aspects um you know again we
 
06:54:15.750 --> 06:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
certainly we certainly agree that it's a
 
06:54:18.468 --> 06:54:18.478 align:start position:0%
best practice to have public comments um
 
06:54:20.390 --> 06:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
but if we're talking about sort of you
 
06:54:22.230 --> 06:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
know open-ended and requiring them as
 
06:54:23.910 --> 06:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
school board maybe holding
 
06:54:27.590 --> 06:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
um a hearing again which is being held
 
06:54:30.230 --> 06:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
in public for say an employee discipline
 
06:54:32.868 --> 06:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
matter that the employee has the right
 
06:54:34.310 --> 06:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
to have that in public session or
 
06:54:35.830 --> 06:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
non-public session but even if it's a
 
06:54:37.750 --> 06:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
non-public session you're opening a
 
06:54:40.628 --> 06:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
public meeting which would mean that
 
06:54:42.150 --> 06:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
if your board's only meeting for that
 
06:54:43.830 --> 06:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
employee matter you're opening the
 
06:54:45.590 --> 06:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
public meeting the public would have a
 
06:54:46.868 --> 06:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
right to come and talk about whatever
 
06:54:48.310 --> 06:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
they wanted to
 
06:54:50.948 --> 06:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
so you know we certainly uh you know
 
06:54:53.750 --> 06:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
agree that that that the public comment
 
06:54:56.230 --> 06:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
is is appropriate for school boards for
 
06:54:56.240 --> 06:54:57.190 align:start position:0%
is is appropriate for school boards for
every

06:54:57.190 --> 06:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
every
 
06:55:00.150 --> 06:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
public body every water commission every
 
06:55:02.310 --> 06:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
library trustees meeting
 
06:55:02.320 --> 06:55:03.110 align:start position:0%
library trustees meeting
um

06:55:03.110 --> 06:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:05.628 --> 06:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh we think that would would be
 
06:55:08.788 --> 06:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
imprudent um and just it's important to
 
06:55:10.788 --> 06:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
note too um
 
06:55:12.708 --> 06:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
i'd be remiss if i didn't state that the
 
06:55:15.110 --> 06:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
state board of education has not taken
 
06:55:17.350 --> 06:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
public comments in about a year
 
06:55:20.070 --> 06:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
um we asked them to be
 
06:55:21.670 --> 06:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
sort of set the example for our local
 
06:55:23.190 --> 06:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
school board so
 
06:55:25.030 --> 06:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:55:27.110 --> 06:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the bill would require them if
 
06:55:29.190 --> 06:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
to do that if it were to to go through
 
06:55:30.548 --> 06:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
but i just want to put it out there that
 
06:55:32.070 --> 06:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
the state board of education has not
 
06:55:34.628 --> 06:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
taken public comments um in about a year
 
06:55:36.628 --> 06:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
so we're in opposition to the bill i'm
 
06:55:38.310 --> 06:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that the
 
06:55:40.708 --> 06:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
06:55:42.310 --> 06:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative nader thank you mr
 
06:55:43.910 --> 06:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
06:55:45.510 --> 06:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
question i'm a little bit confused
 
06:55:47.830 --> 06:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
because the bill is about public comment
 
06:55:50.390 --> 06:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
at the start of the school board how why
 
06:55:53.270 --> 06:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
would that affect what we do here
 
06:55:56.628 --> 06:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
so i'm reading on page line three of the
 
06:55:59.270 --> 06:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
bill representative because all meetings
 
06:56:01.910 --> 06:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
of a public body open to the public
 
06:56:03.830 --> 06:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
under the chapter shall include a period
 
06:56:05.510 --> 06:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
of public comment at the beginning of
 
06:56:07.590 --> 06:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
the agenda for the meeting the bill is
 
06:56:09.270 --> 06:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
not specific to school boards to build
 
06:56:11.110 --> 06:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
specific to all public bodies under the
 
06:56:13.990 --> 06:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
right to no law um the the the
 
06:56:15.270 --> 06:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill spoke
 
06:56:17.190 --> 06:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
specifically to school boards but the
 
06:56:19.030 --> 06:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
language of the bill applies it to all
 
06:56:21.110 --> 06:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
public bodies and the definitions of
 
06:56:23.270 --> 06:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
public bodies in the statute the general
 
06:56:25.430 --> 06:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
court including executive sessions and
 
06:56:26.948 --> 06:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
including any advisory committee
 
06:56:28.948 --> 06:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
established by the general court the
 
06:56:30.708 --> 06:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
executive council and the governor with
 
06:56:32.150 --> 06:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
executive council so there'd have to be
 
06:56:33.910 --> 06:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
a public comment period when governor
 
06:56:35.830 --> 06:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
and council were meeting
 
06:56:38.070 --> 06:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
any board or commission of any state
 
06:56:40.310 --> 06:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
agency or authority i just said that the
 
06:56:41.990 --> 06:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
state board of education is not taking
 
06:56:43.750 --> 06:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
public comments currently
 
06:56:45.830 --> 06:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
the board of trustees of the university
 
06:56:47.670 --> 06:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire and any
 
06:56:49.830 --> 06:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
committee advisory or otherwise they're
 
06:56:52.390 --> 06:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
established by such entities so i've
 
06:56:54.390 --> 06:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
never been to a meeting of the board of
 
06:56:55.910 --> 06:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
trustees i don't know if they take
 
06:56:57.430 --> 06:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
public comment or not
 
06:56:59.590 --> 06:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
any legislative body governing body
 
06:57:01.830 --> 06:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
board commission committee agency or
 
06:57:04.468 --> 06:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
authority of any county town municipal
 
06:57:07.030 --> 06:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
corporation school district so all these
 
06:57:09.030 --> 06:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
public bodies listed in this in the
 
06:57:11.670 --> 06:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
definition of a public body under rsa 91
 
06:57:11.680 --> 06:57:13.110 align:start position:0%
definition of a public body under rsa 91
a1a

06:57:13.110 --> 06:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
a1a
 
06:57:15.190 --> 06:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
would be required to comply with this
 
06:57:16.868 --> 06:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
provision because it's all meetings of a
 
06:57:19.110 --> 06:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
public body shall have a public comment
 
06:57:19.120 --> 06:57:20.628 align:start position:0%
public body shall have a public comment
period

06:57:20.628 --> 06:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
period
 
06:57:23.430 --> 06:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:26.830 --> 06:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
are there other questions mr
 
06:57:29.990 --> 06:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
christina guess i did have it
 
06:57:32.390 --> 06:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
occurred to me one thing that we have
 
06:57:34.788 --> 06:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
our town meetings
 
06:57:37.030 --> 06:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
town meeting includes the first article
 
06:57:38.868 --> 06:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
which is the election
 
06:57:41.030 --> 06:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
of officers so
 
06:57:42.868 --> 06:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
if i were to read this literally it
 
06:57:44.468 --> 06:57:44.478 align:start position:0%
would appear that we need to have a
 
06:57:46.788 --> 06:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
public comment period before we have our
 
06:57:48.230 --> 06:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
election i
 
06:57:49.670 --> 06:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not sure if there was a
 
06:57:52.548 --> 06:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
question in there um mr chair would you
 
06:57:55.670 --> 06:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
believe the question i think
 
06:57:56.868 --> 06:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
06:57:58.628 --> 06:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
the the town meeting or the school
 
06:58:01.670 --> 06:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
district annual meeting
 
06:58:04.070 --> 06:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a public meeting it's kind
 
06:58:05.350 --> 06:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
of not
 
06:58:08.150 --> 06:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know for example um
 
06:58:09.990 --> 06:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
public comment policies for a school
 
06:58:12.390 --> 06:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
board can limit it to say residents of
 
06:58:13.590 --> 06:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
the district
 
06:58:15.990 --> 06:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
or perhaps or or not you know a school
 
06:58:17.510 --> 06:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
board could not have a provision in
 
06:58:19.830 --> 06:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
there limiting it to to residents of the
 
06:58:22.548 --> 06:58:22.558 align:start position:0%
district we know that generally some
 
06:58:24.468 --> 06:58:24.478 align:start position:0%
moderators have rules that if somebody
 
06:58:26.628 --> 06:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak who is not a voter or
 
06:58:28.468 --> 06:58:28.478 align:start position:0%
resident of that district they have to
 
06:58:30.070 --> 06:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
get permission from the moderator so
 
06:58:32.070 --> 06:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
there's some some nuances there
 
06:58:33.590 --> 06:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
certainly open to the public anybody can
 
06:58:34.468 --> 06:58:34.478 align:start position:0%
come in
 
06:58:36.548 --> 06:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
and watch but you know sometimes if
 
06:58:38.628 --> 06:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
there's non-voters they'll put them over
 
06:58:41.030 --> 06:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
in sort of the the the roped off section
 
06:58:42.390 --> 06:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
06:58:44.070 --> 06:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative welper's sort of nodding
 
06:58:47.030 --> 06:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
and smiling along with me so but but you
 
06:58:48.548 --> 06:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
know yeah you would you may have to have
 
06:58:50.310 --> 06:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
a public comment period at the beginning
 
06:58:52.468 --> 06:58:52.478 align:start position:0%
of your annual meeting and the comments
 
06:58:54.230 --> 06:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
may or may not be germane to the
 
06:58:55.910 --> 06:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
business of the legislative body they
 
06:58:57.270 --> 06:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
could talk about global warming as i
 
06:58:59.030 --> 06:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
said global warming the war in
 
06:58:59.040 --> 06:59:00.390 align:start position:0%
said global warming the war in
afghanistan

06:59:00.390 --> 06:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
afghanistan
 
06:59:01.990 --> 06:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
06:59:04.830 --> 06:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
the loch ness monster and who knows what
 
06:59:06.788 --> 06:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
else thank you
 
06:59:09.190 --> 06:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:59:11.110 --> 06:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee
 
06:59:13.110 --> 06:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
 
06:59:13.120 --> 06:59:14.468 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
you

06:59:14.468 --> 06:59:14.478 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:59:19.670 --> 06:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:21.670 --> 06:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate graves for the
 
06:59:23.750 --> 06:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association i'm
 
06:59:25.510 --> 06:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to answer your question to the
 
06:59:28.230 --> 06:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
last witness in the affirmative yes that
 
06:59:30.468 --> 06:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
is the interpretation we would have
 
06:59:33.350 --> 06:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
is that any public any meeting of any
 
06:59:34.868 --> 06:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
public body would have to have a
 
06:59:34.878 --> 06:59:36.070 align:start position:0%
public body would have to have a
15-minute

06:59:36.070 --> 06:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
15-minute
 
06:59:38.070 --> 06:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
public comment period
 
06:59:41.990 --> 06:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
and as the last witness alluded to
 
06:59:44.390 --> 06:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
we think this is uh broader than it
 
06:59:46.628 --> 06:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
needs to be uh if this is something the
 
06:59:48.788 --> 06:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
committee wants to do there are no
 
06:59:51.990 --> 06:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions included in this bill
 
06:59:55.030 --> 06:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
so you could have anything from a
 
06:59:58.310 --> 06:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
cemetery trustees commission which
 
07:00:01.190 --> 07:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
virtually never has anyone come before
 
07:00:04.868 --> 07:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
it um have to have a 15 minute period
 
07:00:04.878 --> 07:00:06.310 align:start position:0%
it um have to have a 15 minute period
um

07:00:06.310 --> 07:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:06.320 --> 07:00:07.350 align:start position:0%
um
and

07:00:07.350 --> 07:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:00:09.270 --> 07:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know there's no reason for that to
 
07:00:09.280 --> 07:00:10.230 align:start position:0%
you know there's no reason for that to
occur

07:00:10.230 --> 07:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
occur
 
07:00:11.910 --> 07:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that they could conduct
 
07:00:13.750 --> 07:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
board business for that 15 minutes or
 
07:00:15.030 --> 07:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
whether they just have to sit there and
 
07:00:16.548 --> 07:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
twiddle their thumbs
 
07:00:19.030 --> 07:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
you have town meeting which
 
07:00:21.590 --> 07:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
is a meeting of a legislative body
 
07:00:23.190 --> 07:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's the townspeople they're there to
 
07:00:25.670 --> 07:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
vote whether or not they want
 
07:00:27.510 --> 07:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
07:00:30.150 --> 07:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
not members of that body to speak is
 
07:00:33.110 --> 07:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
something the body gets to decide
 
07:00:33.120 --> 07:00:33.990 align:start position:0%
something the body gets to decide
and

07:00:33.990 --> 07:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:00:36.070 --> 07:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
they'd have to sit there and listen to
 
07:00:39.830 --> 07:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
people talk for 15 minutes potentially
 
07:00:41.990 --> 07:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
if a board is meeting just for a
 
07:00:44.548 --> 07:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
non-public session is really the only
 
07:00:47.350 --> 07:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
thing on the agenda so for example
 
07:00:48.948 --> 07:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
select board might be considering
 
07:00:48.958 --> 07:00:50.230 align:start position:0%
select board might be considering
abatements

07:00:50.230 --> 07:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
abatements
 
07:00:53.990 --> 07:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
and all of the abatements are uh
 
07:00:56.788 --> 07:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
are for people in town who simply can't
 
07:00:59.190 --> 07:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
afford their property taxes
 
07:01:01.270 --> 07:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
maybe they're you know on fixed incomes
 
07:01:04.468 --> 07:01:04.478 align:start position:0%
disabled uh veterans et cetera
 
07:01:05.750 --> 07:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to meet in non-public
 
07:01:08.230 --> 07:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
session to discuss the abatements
 
07:01:10.150 --> 07:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know they're not going to
 
07:01:12.150 --> 07:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a reputation issue if
 
07:01:14.390 --> 07:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
they put that out in public
 
07:01:16.070 --> 07:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
07:01:17.750 --> 07:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
really all they're doing at that meeting
 
07:01:21.670 --> 07:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
is discussing those finalizing that
 
07:01:22.948 --> 07:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to
 
07:01:24.948 --> 07:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
know what happens at the non-public
 
07:01:26.788 --> 07:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
session except that it's you know they
 
07:01:27.990 --> 07:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
probably won't figure out it's for
 
07:01:29.270 --> 07:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
abatements but
 
07:01:29.280 --> 07:01:30.390 align:start position:0%
abatements but
um

07:01:30.390 --> 07:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:31.830 --> 07:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's really no reason to have a
 
07:01:33.830 --> 07:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
public comment period to begin that and
 
07:01:36.150 --> 07:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
the list kind of goes on and on and on
 
07:01:36.160 --> 07:01:37.350 align:start position:0%
the list kind of goes on and on and on
um

07:01:37.350 --> 07:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:39.350 --> 07:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think i will join the
 
07:01:41.750 --> 07:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
last witness to open up the legislative
 
07:01:44.390 --> 07:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
session here at the general court but
 
07:01:47.350 --> 07:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a concern as well
 
07:01:49.670 --> 07:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
07:01:49.680 --> 07:01:51.030 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
questions

07:01:51.030 --> 07:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:01:54.788 --> 07:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:56.310 --> 07:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
07:01:57.510 --> 07:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
very much
 
07:02:01.350 --> 07:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
and our last card is gloria atalani
 
07:02:25.750 --> 07:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:27.030 --> 07:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
i'll be quick
 
07:02:29.030 --> 07:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
my name is lori ordolano i'm the vice
 
07:02:30.788 --> 07:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
president of right to know new hampshire
 
07:02:34.070 --> 07:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
we support this bill hb1195 relative to
 
07:02:37.750 --> 07:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
amending public comment period
 
07:02:39.510 --> 07:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
at a public meeting and we've amended
 
07:02:41.510 --> 07:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
the language and
 
07:02:43.990 --> 07:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
your copy reflects the amended language
 
07:02:45.830 --> 07:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
we are supporting public comment
 
07:02:48.548 --> 07:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
becoming a part of our open meetings we
 
07:02:50.310 --> 07:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
support public comment at the beginning
 
07:02:52.310 --> 07:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
and the end of the meeting the initial
 
07:02:53.830 --> 07:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
comment would allow the public to
 
07:02:56.390 --> 07:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
provide input on items being acted upon
 
07:02:57.990 --> 07:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
additionally members of the public who
 
07:03:00.070 --> 07:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
can't stay for the second period as
 
07:03:02.070 --> 07:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
often meetings can run late they would
 
07:03:04.390 --> 07:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
be assured of input the second public
 
07:03:06.230 --> 07:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
comment period would allow comments for
 
07:03:08.788 --> 07:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
future agenda items around motions made
 
07:03:10.548 --> 07:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
during the meeting
 
07:03:13.030 --> 07:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't bring you the attached nashua
 
07:03:15.830 --> 07:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
public comment ordinance because
 
07:03:17.670 --> 07:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
i had a printer issue late last night so
 
07:03:20.230 --> 07:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to send it in electronically
 
07:03:22.788 --> 07:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
but in nashua we adopted a policy where
 
07:03:25.110 --> 07:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
we allow a time limit of three minutes
 
07:03:27.430 --> 07:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
with a total public comment time of 15
 
07:03:29.670 --> 07:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
minutes for our public meetings this is
 
07:03:32.150 --> 07:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
a written policy we adopted it from
 
07:03:32.160 --> 07:03:34.310 align:start position:0%
a written policy we adopted it from
manchester

07:03:34.310 --> 07:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
07:03:36.390 --> 07:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
just and even though that's our standing
 
07:03:38.070 --> 07:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
written policy it doesn't mean every
 
07:03:40.948 --> 07:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
meeting has a public input
 
07:03:42.548 --> 07:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
if it's not a regular meeting of the
 
07:03:44.548 --> 07:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
board if it's a special meeting that
 
07:03:46.310 --> 07:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
they're holding
 
07:03:48.070 --> 07:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
or a non-public meeting they don't put
 
07:03:49.350 --> 07:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
one on
 
07:03:53.510 --> 07:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:55.830 --> 07:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
so the amended language we struck the
 
07:03:58.070 --> 07:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
last few lines and we wrote the
 
07:04:00.070 --> 07:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
individual public comment time shall be
 
07:04:01.830 --> 07:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
not less than three minutes with a total
 
07:04:03.910 --> 07:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
public comment time for each period of
 
07:04:06.468 --> 07:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
not less than 15 minutes the content of
 
07:04:08.548 --> 07:04:08.558 align:start position:0%
the public comment should not be limited
 
07:04:11.430 --> 07:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:13.190 --> 07:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
the statements made here with some
 
07:04:15.590 --> 07:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
concern if you would have to hold 15
 
07:04:17.510 --> 07:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
minutes of public comment if nobody was
 
07:04:20.150 --> 07:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
there i don't see why that would be an
 
07:04:22.310 --> 07:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
issue if nobody's there to give public
 
07:04:24.628 --> 07:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
comment then there is no public comment
 
07:04:26.708 --> 07:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
to accept and i don't i don't understand
 
07:04:28.468 --> 07:04:28.478 align:start position:0%
that you would actually sit there
 
07:04:31.510 --> 07:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
for 15 minutes you know the courts have
 
07:04:33.510 --> 07:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
ruled in the past let's say non-public
 
07:04:35.350 --> 07:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
session if you have meetings where
 
07:04:38.150 --> 07:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
nobody is present and a board goes into
 
07:04:40.230 --> 07:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
non-public session very often they're
 
07:04:42.070 --> 07:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
not calling out the statutes to go into
 
07:04:43.590 --> 07:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
non-public session
 
07:04:45.110 --> 07:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the courts have ruled that they
 
07:04:47.590 --> 07:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
didn't violate 91a because there was no
 
07:04:49.750 --> 07:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like when a tree falls if
 
07:04:51.990 --> 07:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
no one's there to hear it did it make a
 
07:04:54.390 --> 07:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
sound you know if nobody's there to hear
 
07:04:56.150 --> 07:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
it called out they don't necessarily
 
07:04:57.270 --> 07:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
call it out
 
07:04:57.280 --> 07:04:58.230 align:start position:0%
call it out
and

07:04:58.230 --> 07:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:04:59.750 --> 07:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
the courts have ruled that that's been
 
07:05:02.070 --> 07:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
implied it was implied that that was a
 
07:05:04.788 --> 07:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
private meeting and these are boards
 
07:05:06.708 --> 07:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
that are operating with no public coming
 
07:05:08.150 --> 07:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
into attendance
 
07:05:08.160 --> 07:05:08.948 align:start position:0%
into attendance
so

07:05:08.948 --> 07:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:05:08.958 --> 07:05:10.628 align:start position:0%
so
um

07:05:10.628 --> 07:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:12.468 --> 07:05:12.478 align:start position:0%
and i can see the need for amending the
 
07:05:14.628 --> 07:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
language somewhat if we need to call out
 
07:05:16.230 --> 07:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
that there are certain special meetings
 
07:05:18.788 --> 07:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't have public comment but
 
07:05:20.868 --> 07:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
for the most part many of our meetings
 
07:05:23.670 --> 07:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
are regular monthly to the tune of 20 to
 
07:05:27.110 --> 07:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
25 meetings for an elected body that are
 
07:05:30.150 --> 07:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
agenda meetings with motions and actions
 
07:05:32.708 --> 07:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
to be taken by the board and those are
 
07:05:34.390 --> 07:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
the meetings that the public is looking
 
07:05:36.230 --> 07:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
for public comment on
 
07:05:37.910 --> 07:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
i can tell you one of the frustrations
 
07:05:39.990 --> 07:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
that i see is that
 
07:05:42.150 --> 07:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
public comment in the general meetings
 
07:05:45.030 --> 07:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
is a policy um
 
07:05:47.030 --> 07:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
is part of policy in nashua but what
 
07:05:48.628 --> 07:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
happens is some of the general meetings
 
07:05:50.628 --> 07:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
the agendas come out and there is no
 
07:05:52.628 --> 07:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
public comment and that's where you run
 
07:05:53.910 --> 07:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
into problems
 
07:05:55.670 --> 07:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know when they don't follow policy
 
07:05:57.750 --> 07:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
or they do it inconsistently
 
07:05:59.190 --> 07:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
some towns
 
07:06:01.430 --> 07:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
allow public comment they allow two the
 
07:06:02.948 --> 07:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
second one is question and answer
 
07:06:05.110 --> 07:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
they're just flexible about that so
 
07:06:06.390 --> 07:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
07:06:07.830 --> 07:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
but what happens is when you have an
 
07:06:09.270 --> 07:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
important topic
 
07:06:12.948 --> 07:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
that there's tremendous public input or
 
07:06:15.830 --> 07:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
disagreement on controversy and you come
 
07:06:18.150 --> 07:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
to a meeting and all of a sudden there's
 
07:06:19.750 --> 07:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
no public comment
 
07:06:21.670 --> 07:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
and you don't expect that that's when
 
07:06:24.390 --> 07:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
you see your public get annoyed
 
07:06:24.400 --> 07:06:25.270 align:start position:0%
you see your public get annoyed
and

07:06:25.270 --> 07:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:06:26.868 --> 07:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
um that's what's happening it's
 
07:06:28.230 --> 07:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
interesting because i had a board of
 
07:06:29.990 --> 07:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
health meeting in nashua yesterday at
 
07:06:32.310 --> 07:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
noon and i raced down from here to go to
 
07:06:34.468 --> 07:06:34.478 align:start position:0%
it to see what was going on the agenda
 
07:06:36.150 --> 07:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
had no public comment they're supposed
 
07:06:38.070 --> 07:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
to have public comment and they invited
 
07:06:40.310 --> 07:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
in two hospital executives
 
07:06:42.788 --> 07:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
to give essentially public comment
 
07:06:45.190 --> 07:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
stating that it was they were invited
 
07:06:47.110 --> 07:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
because of the interest of the public
 
07:06:49.030 --> 07:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
and questions they had
 
07:06:50.788 --> 07:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
but there was no
 
07:06:53.590 --> 07:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
ability to ask any questions or to even
 
07:06:55.590 --> 07:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
put a statement on the record
 
07:06:57.350 --> 07:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
and no one knew those executives were
 
07:06:57.360 --> 07:06:58.230 align:start position:0%
and no one knew those executives were
coming

07:06:58.230 --> 07:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
coming
 
07:07:00.390 --> 07:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
and that's when the public becomes
 
07:07:00.400 --> 07:07:01.750 align:start position:0%
and that's when the public becomes
frustrated

07:07:01.750 --> 07:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
frustrated
 
07:07:03.670 --> 07:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i see this happening over and over
 
07:07:04.868 --> 07:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
again on
 
07:07:07.430 --> 07:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know issues of controversy and lord
 
07:07:09.270 --> 07:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
knows the last two years have been
 
07:07:11.430 --> 07:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
years that have been really challenging
 
07:07:12.708 --> 07:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
for all of us
 
07:07:14.708 --> 07:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
um and the school side is
 
07:07:17.190 --> 07:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
really torn up and the municipal side
 
07:07:20.468 --> 07:07:20.478 align:start position:0%
has its you know areas hot spots too
 
07:07:20.478 --> 07:07:21.270 align:start position:0%
has its you know areas hot spots too
so

07:07:21.270 --> 07:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:07:23.350 --> 07:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
you're seeing you know we back this and
 
07:07:24.948 --> 07:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
maybe to some extent it's a little
 
07:07:27.350 --> 07:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
unusual but
 
07:07:28.868 --> 07:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a lot of interest in
 
07:07:30.868 --> 07:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
particularly on the school sides
 
07:07:32.548 --> 07:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
and trying to get a public voice
 
07:07:34.948 --> 07:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
established more regularly in these
 
07:07:34.958 --> 07:07:36.390 align:start position:0%
established more regularly in these
meetings

07:07:36.390 --> 07:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
07:07:39.270 --> 07:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
so any questions and i i think i would
 
07:07:41.350 --> 07:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
go back to my group and ask if we want
 
07:07:43.750 --> 07:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
to consider amending it
 
07:07:43.760 --> 07:07:44.468 align:start position:0%
to consider amending it
to

07:07:44.468 --> 07:07:44.478 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:07:45.990 --> 07:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
make it clearer that we're looking at
 
07:07:47.670 --> 07:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
the regular meetings of the board with
 
07:07:50.390 --> 07:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
agendas and motions and action items not
 
07:07:53.030 --> 07:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
special meetings of boards and to those
 
07:07:55.270 --> 07:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
boards that never have the public come
 
07:07:57.510 --> 07:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
put the public comment period in what do
 
07:07:59.350 --> 07:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
you lose it's a it's a looks great on
 
07:08:00.628 --> 07:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
your agenda
 
07:08:02.230 --> 07:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
somebody might want to come
 
07:08:05.350 --> 07:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
but a lot of them nobody comes so
 
07:08:07.270 --> 07:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's a good will gesture and you're not
 
07:08:10.948 --> 07:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:16.310 --> 07:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:19.030 --> 07:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
if i do the only question the the
 
07:08:19.040 --> 07:08:20.310 align:start position:0%
if i do the only question the the
sponsor

07:08:20.310 --> 07:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
07:08:23.110 --> 07:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh one of the co-sponsors representative
 
07:08:24.788 --> 07:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
baldassaro when he testified he talked
 
07:08:27.910 --> 07:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
about specifically about school board
 
07:08:27.920 --> 07:08:29.830 align:start position:0%
about specifically about school board
meetings

07:08:29.830 --> 07:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
07:08:31.590 --> 07:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
really didn't
 
07:08:34.708 --> 07:08:34.718 align:start position:0%
relate it to other types of meetings and
 
07:08:37.430 --> 07:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
frankly in terms of the feedback i've
 
07:08:37.440 --> 07:08:38.548 align:start position:0%
frankly in terms of the feedback i've
gotten

07:08:38.548 --> 07:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
07:08:41.910 --> 07:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
publicly from my district
 
07:08:44.548 --> 07:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
i think the only criticism i've heard is
 
07:08:47.750 --> 07:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
of regarding school boards in particular
 
07:08:49.190 --> 07:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
and i was just wondering if you had
 
07:08:50.788 --> 07:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
thoughts about
 
07:08:53.110 --> 07:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
limiting the
 
07:08:55.030 --> 07:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
this bill to
 
07:08:57.430 --> 07:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
school board meetings as opposed to
 
07:08:59.990 --> 07:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
making it across the board to every type
 
07:09:01.510 --> 07:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
of public meeting
 
07:09:03.670 --> 07:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
if that presents a
 
07:09:05.910 --> 07:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
stopping point for it i'd like to see it
 
07:09:08.390 --> 07:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
there for school boards really would i
 
07:09:11.670 --> 07:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:13.830 --> 07:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
but i think all groups like i said
 
07:09:15.030 --> 07:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
boards of health are doing some
 
07:09:16.628 --> 07:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
interesting things right now that have
 
07:09:18.150 --> 07:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
interest in nashua
 
07:09:19.750 --> 07:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
our assessing board has been doing some
 
07:09:21.110 --> 07:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
interesting things that sometimes the
 
07:09:25.430 --> 07:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:27.030 --> 07:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
we'd like to
 
07:09:28.948 --> 07:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
i can see it working on the municipal
 
07:09:31.110 --> 07:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
side as well but certainly
 
07:09:32.868 --> 07:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
i would be receptive and talk to right
 
07:09:34.948 --> 07:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
to know new hampshire about just putting
 
07:09:37.270 --> 07:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
this down for school boards
 
07:09:39.030 --> 07:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's a starting point
 
07:09:40.628 --> 07:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important
 
07:09:41.750 --> 07:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:09:46.150 --> 07:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:48.310 --> 07:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:09:49.670 --> 07:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
07:09:55.430 --> 07:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:57.830 --> 07:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no one will close the hearing
 
07:10:01.030 --> 07:10:01.040 align:start position:0%

07:10:03.350 --> 07:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
