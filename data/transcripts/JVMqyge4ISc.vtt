00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
requiring an audit of ballots cast
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
does anyone have on the committee now
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
this this bill has been passed by the
 
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.630 align:start position:0%
this this bill has been passed by the
house

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
our task really is to focus on this
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
and finance
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
and there is an estimate of expenditures
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
in here
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
between fifty and one hundred thousand
 
00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:30.310 align:start position:0%
between fifty and one hundred thousand
dollars

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
time and
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
to actually run these ballots through
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's a sampling process as i read the
 
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.350 align:start position:0%
it's a sampling process as i read the
bill

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody have any issues with
 
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.190 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody have any issues with
this

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
no and if there's no one to testify i
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
i was just trying to figure out
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm still trying to figure out where
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
we are and i thought you said we just
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
finished the hearing no i reconvened the
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
hearing because it started at 11 30.
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
right i came in and recessed it thank
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
you now i understand so we're basically
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
effectively opening the hearing on 366
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
is that what we're doing right now yes
 
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.269 align:start position:0%
is that what we're doing right now yes
okay

00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
and so just to follow so apparently
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's nobody to testify so you were
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
going to make a motion on it is that it
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
just trying to get caught up i'm a
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
little slow right that's all right
 
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
little slow right that's all right
sometimes

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
okay motion by maureen yes i would make
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
a motion of ought to pass on senate bill
 
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.870 align:start position:0%
a motion of ought to pass on senate bill
366.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.669 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm still trying to figure
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
out what this bill does is this only the
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
audit this is not a bill that creates
 
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.430 align:start position:0%
audit this is not a bill that creates
the

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
the temporary ballots correct
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
this is uh is basically
 
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.909 align:start position:0%
this is uh is basically
sampling

00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
sampling
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
the machines and auditing them with
 
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.430 align:start position:0%
the machines and auditing them with
ballots

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is the secretary of
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
state can do this without this bill why
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
we have this bill like he can just do
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
i guess that's the answer i mean it has
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
to have an approval of ex for
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures and how much are we given
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
fifty to a hundred
 
00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.269 align:start position:0%
fifty to a hundred
dollars

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollars
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh hundreds of companies here from the
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
um could i ask that maybe
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
for their input just on for clarity
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
prior to going forward with the vote
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
just for my own edification sure yeah i
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
no there's no this is a work session
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's no pink cards no
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
but we are being
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh live streaming
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
yes um this bill is
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
we'd have to um purchase a high speed
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
scanner um
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
we expect it's actually going to be the
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
higher end of the 50 to 100 000 um the
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note this is a bill that's been
 
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.549 align:start position:0%
fiscal note this is a bill that's been
here

00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
many times in the past it's going to
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
require that the secretary of state's
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
office do
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
a recount using a high-speed scanner of
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
two towns or two
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
two voting locations um
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
at the primary and four at the general
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
election and that they have to be done
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
by noon on friday
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
which obviously it's a busy week as you
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
can imagine for the secretary of state's
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
office uh i think the point of this bill
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
is trying to give people
 
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.509 align:start position:0%
is trying to give people
confidence

00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
in the machines originally the bill was
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
to do just a machine not the whole
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
voting location
 
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.669 align:start position:0%
voting location
and

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
i sort of explained to them that we're
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
not used to keeping our
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
our votes separate by machine so the
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
chances of there being a you know 100
 
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.830 align:start position:0%
chances of there being a you know 100
200

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
200
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
difference which would do the opposite
 
00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.269 align:start position:0%
difference which would do the opposite
of

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
giving voters confidence in the election
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
so they did take that out and said it
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
all of the machines
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
but it's supposed to be just the um
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
machine counted
 
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.669 align:start position:0%
machine counted
numbers

00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
so i there's still concerns that
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
towns may put some of their hand counted
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
ballots in with the machine counted
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
ballots and and that could cause a uh
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
a difference but
 
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.350 align:start position:0%
a difference but
and

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know i i'm not
 
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
looking at it as if we're trying to give
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
people confidence
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
really why does it need to be done by
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
noon on
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
on friday
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
um but that's what the bill calls for
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
that have to be done by
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
noon on friday
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
and for the cost i said we have to
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
either we've looked at if you rent a
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanner the expenses of
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
of having it programmed
 
00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:17.589 align:start position:0%
of having it programmed
and

00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be choosing which
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
towns they're going to be programmed for
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
until uh just before the election and
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
the town will not know that they were
 
00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:27.430 align:start position:0%
the town will not know that they were
chosen

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
until i think it's um it originally
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't built i don't think that changed
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
until like noon on the the day of voting
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
so they need to get their ballots to the
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office we need to
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
do the recounts
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
um the high speed scanner recounts and
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
have it done by
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
noon on
 
00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:50.069 align:start position:0%
noon on
friday

00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we have nothing else to do that
 
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.669 align:start position:0%
yeah we have nothing else to do that
week

00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
so given that
 
00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.230 align:start position:0%
so given that
in

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
let's say weighing the benefit
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure of that of this compared to
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
the practicality of it
 
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.790 align:start position:0%
the practicality of it
um

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
is it practical to do this i mean that
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
just i'm asking for opinion i know
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's what it's um well that's that's
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
basically your job to decide if it's
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
worth it but
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the house
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the house in the senate passes
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
and the governor signs the secretary of
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
will make happen it doesn't mean that it
 
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:28.870 align:start position:0%
will make happen it doesn't mean that it
might

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
it'll add a lot to obviously a week
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's um that's that's pretty busy um
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
for us but
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
i i guess you have to weigh
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
is the 100 are we going to be giving
 
00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
is the 100 are we going to be giving
voters

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
that much more confidence
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
in the election by doing this um
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
just to let you know
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
another bill that has gone through both
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
is going to double the number of hand
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
recounts that are done and i fully
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
expect that the governor is going to
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
sign it
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
every recount that we do
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
we are going to
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
also have to do a recount of
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
one of the races between executive
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
council and president
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
so we are we are doubling the number of
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
of recounts that we will be doing
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
um which
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
we weren't doing that the last time that
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
this bill i mean this this this bill has
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
been before this committee um
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
at least a couple other times that i
 
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.109 align:start position:0%
at least a couple other times that i
remember

00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
remember here so we will be doing 100
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
more recounts
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
um i expect for both the primary and the
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
general than we have done in in past
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
elections so the the decision for you to
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
make is is the hundred thousand
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
are we going to be giving you know 100
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
000 dollars of more voter confidence
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
in the election by doing these high
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
high-speed recounts
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
the week of
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
just make sure i understand this
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
correctly the um
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
genesis bill says to do another machine
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
count for something that's already been
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
machine counted to assure that the first
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
machine count um is accurate is that yes
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the cost is up to a hundred thousand
 
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.790 align:start position:0%
and the cost is up to a hundred thousand
plus

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
plus
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh additional overtime or whatever
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
happens within the secretary of state's
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
office i just
 
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.750 align:start position:0%
office i just
um

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
i just don't see the
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
benefit that's all thank you mr chair as
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
as as you're asking the question and a
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
benefit came to mind
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
thinking i was thinking that what
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
lift up the hood on this what does it do
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
it could be it is a way to discourage
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
nefarious actions
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
with voting machines
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that some of them are going to
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
be audited on a random basis
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
is a deterrent for somebody to mess with
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
a machine i mean that
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
under the hood
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
so it may be a defensive
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
action as much as it is a confirmation
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and and no town knows that they're
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
have a recount anyway i mean they're as
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
you all know they're
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
most of the recounts are related to um
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
state rep races we do have them
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes on senate but we tend to have
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
more on state rep so no
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
no town
 
00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.550 align:start position:0%
no town
um

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
knows that whether or not they're going
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
have a recount and like this here it'll
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
it'll be two towns
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
two towns added to that potential
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
at the primary and floor at the uh at
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
oh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
for testifying i agree that audits
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
recounts aren't going away anytime soon
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
the purchase of this scanner will can be
 
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.470 align:start position:0%
the purchase of this scanner will can be
used

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
just for this just for this
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
all um in in uh
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
all recounts
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
have to be done by hand
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
a special exemption
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
just for these that are done um
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
the two in the primary and four at the
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
general done
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
by noon on friday
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
okay but audits can this machinery be
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
used for future audits
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
we don't normally the only time that
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
there is a audit is if there is a
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
special legislation
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
by the house and senate and signed by
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
the governor to do an audit
 
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.310 align:start position:0%
the governor to do an audit
our

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.990 align:start position:0%
our
laws

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
allow anyone to ask for a recount and if
 
00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:46.150 align:start position:0%
allow anyone to ask for a recount and if
you're

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
the amount that you lost by was a
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
certain percentage there's no cost if
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
it's above that there's additional cost
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
and you know to the point where if it's
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
beyond a certain percentage you have to
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
pay for the entire thing
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
once that recount is done there is no
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
provision in our rsas
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
to do a second recount
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
or on audit the only time
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
that that would happen is that there is
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
special legislation such that as there
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
was in the wyndham case
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
just one more follow-up so if that were
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
to happen if the next legislative
 
00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:19.430 align:start position:0%
to happen if the next legislative
session

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
somehow mandates an audit could this
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
equipment be used no because those are
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
those are hand counts
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
if you had a
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
um like like i said the example of the
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
windham audit that was
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
we had other people come in they
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
completely validated the hand count that
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office did
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
but it's a hand count it's not done by
 
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.670 align:start position:0%
but it's a hand count it's not done by
machines

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm following up on the previous
 
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.710 align:start position:0%
i'm following up on the previous
questions

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
so this machine
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
that would be at least
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
for purchase
 
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.069 align:start position:0%
for purchase
purchased

00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
is probably better um i assume then to
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
avoid issues that other where the
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
original machines might have had this is
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
like an air gapped removed from
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
putting it on i you know the because i
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
work at the polls
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
as a as a supervisor of the checklist
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
basically now at least in my area
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
it plugs into the phone line
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
no no it plugs into the wall they're not
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're not connected to the internet
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
okay none of none of our accu volt
 
00:41:31.839 --> 00:41:33.030 align:start position:0%
okay none of none of our accu volt
machines

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
statewide because i thought it
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
transmitted no it does not transmit no
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's never used to do that so
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
then i guess the real question i have is
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
not about how it used to be so
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
there's a benefit to this
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
not being attached to anything it's a
 
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.950 align:start position:0%
not being attached to anything it's a
standalone

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
standalone
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
air gap
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes just like our accuvope machines are
 
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.430 align:start position:0%
yes just like our accuvope machines are
standalone

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
standalone
 
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
standalone
machines

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
it would be taking
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
the ballots from the accuvolt machine
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's a town that has one machine
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
or a town that has
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
or a ward that has two or three machines
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
we would be taking the ballots from that
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
one voting location so if it was
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
if manchester was picked it would only
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
be one ward in manchester it would not
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
be any place that's got more than one
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
voting location
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
this bill is for one
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
voting location
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
all the machines in that one voting
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
location and those machines right now
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
are not connected
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
our machines have not been connected to
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
the internet they are
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead and represent
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
question if this is going to happen are
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
the candidates
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
on the ballot notified of it so they can
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
be part of the public witnessing and if
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
they choose to
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
it will be uh
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
the town will be notified that day and
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
by noon time on that day
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
that they have been um they have been
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
selected and there's nothing in the bill
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
to notify them
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
the candidates but i assume that
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
candidates will probably find out
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
like it just says we have to notify them
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
representative patch thank you mr chair
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
so if i may and i and i understand your
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
comment that maybe that would be um a
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
deterrent and a theorist activity but um
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
those that participate in the theories
 
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.670 align:start position:0%
those that participate in the theories
activity

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
do odds
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
and there's only two
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
voting machines picked
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
i mean uh chances of being successful if
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
you in fact were going to do that are
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
pretty their odds are with you and also
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that it's
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
as it's structured now it's pretty hard
 
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.390 align:start position:0%
as it's structured now it's pretty hard
to

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
tinker with the voting machines as they
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
are so i i'm just in all honesty i'm all
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
for a verified vote i'm all for i'm kind
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
of tired of hearing how the vote was
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
rigged um for something that would stem
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
that activity but i don't see it
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
can i just back up one comment that um
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative walsh made would it be in
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
public it would definitely be in public
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
i mean there is nothing that we do
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
regarding odd
 
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.790 align:start position:0%
regarding odd
elections

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
in this state that are not
 
00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:30.230 align:start position:0%
in this state that are not
that

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
are not open to the public just like all
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
of our recounts that we do
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's for a state rep or senate
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
race or executive council whatever those
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
are all open to the public and this
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
would also be open to the public like i
 
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
said it does need to be done in a very
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative griffin thank you mr
 
00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
representative griffin thank you mr
chair

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
given the controversy we had in the last
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
election that was surrounded
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
around the voting machines
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
i think this is a very important bill
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh just for my uh
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know just to tell the public yes
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the machines
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people who don't have
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
any faith in the machines
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
be that be that
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
unfounded or not
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
i think that this is a pretty good bill
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
and will give people a little more faith
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and to follow up on those
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
comments you're not alone in thinking
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
that representative griffin because this
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
bill came out of the election law
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
committee 20 to zero
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
that is rare i served on election law
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
last year maybe some of you did too
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
previously it's oftentimes quite
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
partisan and to come out 20 to nothing
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
is huge also on the consent calendar on
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
april 15th so that's huge also so
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
obviously we're not the only ones that
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
feel that this is important and for this
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
kind of money i'll be voting for my own
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor by representative
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
mooney seconded by representative
 
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.870 align:start position:0%
mooney seconded by representative
griffin

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
griffin
 
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.390 align:start position:0%
griffin
okay

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
oh you do i'm sorry
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
so i heard on the news this morning that
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office has set
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
up a commission to look at the security
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
of voting and i'm wondering if it has
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
any relationship to what we're
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
discussing right now it's not security
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
of elections it's voter confidence
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
it is it is a uh commission they had a
 
00:46:35.839 --> 00:46:36.710 align:start position:0%
it is it is a uh commission they had a
um

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
press uh meeting was at eleven o'clock
 
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
today um i forgot how many members there
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
are that it may be 15 16 people from
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
both parties um
 
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.829 align:start position:0%
both parties um
and

00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
the the the two um
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
co-chairs were there that was a press
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
conference earlier today trying to
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
address the issue of voter confidence
 
00:46:59.119 --> 00:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
address the issue of voter confidence
it's

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
obviously it's
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
there have been any problems whatsoever
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire elections i think our
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire elections have been very
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
safe and fair
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
there is a perception and you need to
 
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.430 align:start position:0%
there is a perception and you need to
deal

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
deal
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
not only with reality but you have to
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
deal with people's perceptions and
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's what this commission is going to
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
be having listening sessions all over
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
the state they may have some
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation though
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's not specifically set up for that
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
but we but they may very well come up
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
with some recommendations for
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
for future legislation
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
but my question was
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
is there a relationship between that
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
commission and what we're doing here no
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
no these were both completely
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
independent of one another
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
senator divorce yeah just to comment i
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
know in berlin we secure our machines
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
you think passing legislation that
 
00:47:55.119 --> 00:47:56.390 align:start position:0%
you think passing legislation that
require

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh towns or cities to secure the
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
machines in another place i know in
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
berlin only the clerk and the assistant
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
clerk have access to that room there
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
there are there are uh there is
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislation there are rsas specifically
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%

00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:18.549 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
now

00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
we have i have a question who's
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
i need your name for a replacement i'm
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%

00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
almost all the letters that you could
 
00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.910 align:start position:0%
almost all the letters that you could
use

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
okay without further comment if the
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
clerk would call the role that this is
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
on uh senate bill
 
00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:47.750 align:start position:0%
on uh senate bill
motions 366.

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
motions 366.
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
to pass are we gonna have any discussion
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
on this because i have a point i'd like
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
no i meant now in this division go ahead
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
i i think this is a waste of money i
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
mean we've got one of the most secure
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
elections in the country we've got as
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative pointing out these
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
machines are secured
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think this is a solution looking for a
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
problem and i i agree with i can't
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
remember who was it talked about the
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
odds but we're talking about two voting
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
locations out of probably 200 or more in
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
this state you're talking about maybe
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
one percent if if you're going to
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
mucking around with the election the
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
odds are you're not going to get caught
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
by this and i think you know
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
we're whining about spending money all
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
over the place i think this is a wasted
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars and i cannot
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
support this i again i think this is a
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a problem that
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have security issues here and i
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't think that the way this is being
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
put forward there's any way that this is
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
going to be able to really
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
bring comfort to those who see problems
 
00:49:55.839 --> 00:49:57.030 align:start position:0%
bring comfort to those who see problems
that

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
they think may be there
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
so that i just wanted to say that before
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
we vote because again i have a real hard
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
time supporting this
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay i think that's fine i mean then
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
vote no because uh
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
as representative said it came out of
 
00:50:10.559 --> 00:50:11.270 align:start position:0%
as representative said it came out of
the

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee 20-0
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the policy committee
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
we're here whether it's a good use of
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
money and i'm saying on the money issue
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's a good use of money
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to look at it from a
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
finance point of view and from the
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
finance point of view i think this is a
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
waste of money so somebody may have
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
thought an election law what the heck
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
why not you know it's not going to cost
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
me anything so we'll do something that
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
might give somebody a sense of security
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
and then it comes to us to say is this a
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
good use of money and i'm saying no
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
we're wasting taxpayers money with this
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's a good use to
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
money okay
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your thought yes
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
representations thank you sir
 
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.349 align:start position:0%
representations thank you sir
um

00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm inclined to agree with her although
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
i will say i've yet to make up my mind
 
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:52.950 align:start position:0%
i will say i've yet to make up my mind
but

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
i do know i believe you mentioned mr
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
chair that this would be a deterrent to
 
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.349 align:start position:0%
chair that this would be a deterrent to
shenanigans

00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
shenanigans
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
i would hope the existing law
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
the deterrent to shenanigans
 
00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:06.790 align:start position:0%
the deterrent to shenanigans
and

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
i mean i would have more confidence in
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
this process if it
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
if the choices were more than two out of
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
how many voting locations do we have a
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
thousand something
 
00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:17.670 align:start position:0%
thousand something
yeah

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
and but the good news is
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
from all the investigations i know our
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has taken
 
00:51:26.319 --> 00:51:27.190 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has taken
uh

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.549 align:start position:0%
uh
on

00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
on
uh

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
instances of voter fraud are so
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
infinitesimal it's not even close to one
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
percent it's a it's a minuscule
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
mini fraction if i understood you
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
correctly and the bigger issue issues
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
are things like and we've eliminated
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
this like matching
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
handwriting on one
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
you know absentee ballot to the original
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
form all those sorts of things i mean i
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
think the the systems we have been
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
putting in place should
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
do as good of if not better of a job as
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
it is now
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and probably the money is
 
00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:06.710 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and probably the money is
not

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.270 align:start position:0%
not
needed

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
sorry mr mr chairman
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
i know that some states don't use paper
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
ballots and that's a problem some states
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
require you can vote through the
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
internet which
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
for me is a big big problem
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
however you know i tend to agree that i
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
was thinking about
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
this being a waste of money
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
two machines you don't know where
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
can't be a deterrent at all at all at
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
all as far as i'm concerned you know i
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
could see when we're going to be dealing
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
with perhaps a federal election but you
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
so with the clerk call the roll
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay the motions have to pass on senate
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to have an hour but somehow the
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
schedule got messed up so we're going to
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
do those two bills
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
being one o'clock i'll call the work
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
session on senate bill
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
267 order
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
and i believe we have an amendment
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
and commission would you like to speak
 
01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
to the points of the amendment
 
01:31:30.710 --> 01:31:41.750 align:start position:0%
to the points of the amendment
[Laughter]

01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay this is on amendment
 
01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:57.350 align:start position:0%
okay this is on amendment
1779

01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
and you've got to turn your mic on
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
because we're streaming live all right
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
before the record i am sean jasper
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of
 
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.830 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of
agriculture

01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
the the original bill was
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh senator guida's bill we did work
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
closely with him
 
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.470 align:start position:0%
closely with him
um

01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
on that bill but we're not
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
in charge of the the final
 
01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.470 align:start position:0%
in charge of the the final
um

01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
language as this
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
went through the house
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
um chairman
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
pearl actually uh
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
asked one question which we hadn't
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
really looked at that's in
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
section e it's relative to
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
herbicides in bulk quantities and
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
distribute that's not really
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
practical and would not it would require
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
different licensing for us we don't have
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
facilities to store it
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
so um worked on language
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
that in e and i'm sorry for going
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
backwards i got ahead of myself but
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
to subsidize the purchase of herbicides
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
by municipalities when the funding is
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
available and have them apply back to us
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement obviously there's
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
limited monies here we don't believe
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of municipalities that
 
01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.470 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of municipalities that
actually

01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
do this themselves so most of the money
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
that is in the bill would be something
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
that the department itself would be
 
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.590 align:start position:0%
that the department itself would be
purchasing

01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
um and doing the spraying we do have
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
people that are
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
licensed to do that we work with
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities very careful closely as
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
well as with the d.o.t
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
so this this part of it was strictly
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
something that senator guydo wanted to
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
put in there to make it a benefit to
 
01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.830 align:start position:0%
put in there to make it a benefit to
municipalities

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
so now if i move backwards
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
d is simply
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
something that in working on this i
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
caught that we were using two
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
terminologies the bill itself was
 
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.830 align:start position:0%
terminologies the bill itself was
um

01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
i don't have it in front of me so used
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
one terminology to just
 
01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.470 align:start position:0%
one terminology to just
to

01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
describe the program and then section e
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
used another one so it
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
it would appear to anybody reading it
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
that we were really talking about two
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
different programs when we weren't so
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
this is just a cons matter of
 
01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
this is just a cons matter of
consistency

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
you does anybody have any discussion
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
before we pick up the amendment on the
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
if i maybe it's determined sorry
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner um
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
does the department practice uh integra
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
integration integrated pest control ipm
 
01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.870 align:start position:0%
integration integrated pest control ipm
management

01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes we try we try to so
 
01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.790 align:start position:0%
yes we try we try to so
um

01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
the one person that we have it's not his
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
primary job but he's sort of moved into
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
that area and if we do get funding if
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
this bill passes and then the next year
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
we get funding he'd be the person
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
that does that on a full-time basis but
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
yes we use any any method that's
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate we try not to use chemicals
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
at all if possible so
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
um our goal is
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
is to do it as naturally as as possible
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
but that
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
but it's not always uh feasible either
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
particularly when you're dealing with
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
large quantities particularly of things
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
like knotweed and
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
things like that stuff
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that clarification
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%

01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
i know i walked in a little bit late
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
during this but i'm just trying to
 
01:37:11.119 --> 01:37:12.229 align:start position:0%
during this but i'm just trying to
understand

01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
why this is outside the budget
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
your guess is as good as mine
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
can we ask the commissioner
 
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.149 align:start position:0%
can we ask the commissioner
sure

01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
so you're asking why didn't we just wait
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
and put it in the budget
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
coming up for it or why wasn't it
 
01:37:40.159 --> 01:37:41.189 align:start position:0%
coming up for it or why wasn't it
well

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:37:41.199 --> 01:37:42.149 align:start position:0%
well
so

01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
while this has been a priority of mine
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
and it was one of the things i i
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned when
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
i was confirmed is that we needed to
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
deal with invasive species
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
frankly with the last budget cycle we
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
were really told to hold off
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
and so i had to be very creative in
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
dealing maintaining the department and
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
there was really no
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
no ability to expand at that point so
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
senator guida came aft you know this
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
year with with this request and we do
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
feel that it's appropriate to get going
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible but
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
um i can't tell you 100 percent that i
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
would have requested
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
the funding in a in a previous budget
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
because i never had that opportunity due
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
to the constraints that were put on me
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
at the time but this is
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
a department uh priority
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay all right that's an answer thank
 
01:38:32.639 --> 01:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
okay all right that's an answer thank
you

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
any other quote into the comments
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
motions made and seconded
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh ought to pass 267
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%

senior deputy secretary of state i just
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you some information on
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
this bill the bill was changed quite a
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%

01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:26.790 align:start position:0%
this bill is requiring is now calling
for

01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
for those who
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
register to vote for the first time in
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
without an id
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
the original bill was for all affidavit
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
voters there are three types of
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
affidavit voters there's an affidavit
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
for domicile
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
there's one age in citizenship
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
and then there's one for an id
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i mean it's possible that someone
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
could need all three forms but this bill
 
01:40:59.679 --> 01:41:00.629 align:start position:0%
could need all three forms but this bill
now

01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
is related to those that don't have an
 
01:41:02.719 --> 01:41:04.310 align:start position:0%
is related to those that don't have an
id

01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
id
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
and were registering to vote for the
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
first time in new hampshire that day
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
just to give you some information
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
the id voters are we call those
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
challenged voter affidavits that means
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
you didn't have an id
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 election there were
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
733 people
 
01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.629 align:start position:0%
733 people
statewide

01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
that voted without an id
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
we do not keep
 
01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.270 align:start position:0%
we do not keep
information

01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
and our data as to how many of those
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
were people who just came to vote and
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
forgot their
 
01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
their um id versus how many were
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
registering to vote that day um our gut
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
belief is that the vast majority of that

only to those bills but it still
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
requires that
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
for each of those people who are
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
registering to vote today
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
and don't have an id with them
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%

01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
overnight envelope to send it to the
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office uh the
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
postage for those is basically thirty
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
dollars for for each one of them
 
01:42:32.639 --> 01:42:33.590 align:start position:0%
dollars for for each one of them
uh

01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
uh
the

01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
moderator will have to
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
write on the back of the ballot that
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know um affidavit voter number one
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit voter number two etc
 
01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.189 align:start position:0%
affidavit voter number two etc
uh

01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
theoretically in the bill it says that
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
those are supposed to be put into the
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
side pocket in and hand counted at the
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of you have been involved
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
in elections before if you are the
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
person that is standing there in front
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
of the ballot box you know the the
 
01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:07.270 align:start position:0%
of the ballot box you know the the
machine

01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
the machine will take a ballot going
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
this way this way this way you know all
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
four ways so if a
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
voter where they've written you know
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit voter number five on the back
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
flips that over and goes to put it in
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
the machine you are not going to know
 
01:43:25.119 --> 01:43:26.950 align:start position:0%
the machine you are not going to know
that

01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
that was there
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
there are some things that will need to
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
be changed eventually if this does go
 
01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
be changed eventually if this does go
through

01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's an rsa about no extraneous marks
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
on ballots obviously this is you're
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
we're telling the moderator to make an
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
extraneous extraneous vote
 
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
um another change that was made in this
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
um this bill was that it
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
originally was going to be effective for
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
the primaries coming up
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
and the effective date has been put off
 
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.189 align:start position:0%
and the effective date has been put off
to

01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
next year to 2023 so the first time that
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
this would be in place is for the um
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
first in the nation primary
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
we are going to still have a first
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
nation primary
 
01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.470 align:start position:0%
nation primary
uh

01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
so there there will be if there's a
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
court challenge um there there will be
 
01:44:19.199 --> 01:44:20.870 align:start position:0%
court challenge um there there will be
um

01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
time to do that the secretary of state
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
has taken the position on this bill
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
that you know that that he was in
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
support of it but
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
he would prefer that it would be laid on
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
the table and brought to the supreme
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
court to deal with the
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
but obviously that's up to the
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to decide how you want to um
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
how you want to handle any bill so
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
the votes will be counted
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
if you have one of these affidavit
 
01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.030 align:start position:0%
if you have one of these affidavit
ballots

01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
your vote is going to be counted that
 
01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.030 align:start position:0%
your vote is going to be counted that
day

01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%

01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
you have seven days to get your envelope
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%

01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%

01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
if the secretary of state does not
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
receive that in seven days and each of
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%

01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%

at after the end of the seventh day
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%

01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
retrieve um ballot number two
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:39.109 align:start position:0%
six and nine

voted for remove that from your totals
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the way that this bill
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
works i just wanted you to
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
to be sure that you understood what the
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
bill is um take any questions if you
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
questions go ahead
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman you mentioned
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of your testimony a fee
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
of 30 dollars yes
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
so that's um as part of the um amended
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that you have it includes
 
01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:14.070 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that you have it includes
that

01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
since i had no way of knowing of those
 
01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.870 align:start position:0%
since i had no way of knowing of those
733

01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
733
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
ones that we had last time how many of
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
them were
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
you know registering to vote that day
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
versus how many of them
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
just forgot their id i assumed that they
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
were all people that were first-time
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
voters so the uh
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that you have is on
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
the high side assuming that all 733
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
of them and obviously we only have to
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
pay them postage for somebody who
 
01:46:44.159 --> 01:46:45.669 align:start position:0%
pay them postage for somebody who
actually

01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
mails it back but the secretary of
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
state's office will need to provide
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
these packets
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
for every every voting location and we
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
do have 308 i think it is
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you and thank
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question so of the
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
733 you referred to yes at the beginning
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
that was in which election that was in
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
the 2020 presidential election okay 2020
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
general yes follow up
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
so um obviously of those 733
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
that includes more than just those
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
registering to vote for the first time
 
01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
registering to vote for the first time
so

01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
if we did an estimate it would be less
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
than 700 if if i were you my gut feel
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
it's probably under 200. okay and of
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
those 733 just give you the full info um
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office needed
 
01:47:46.109 --> 01:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
to to reach out to all 430
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
733 people who voted by challenged voter
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
we sent postcards to all of them 438
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
returned their cards 215 didn't respond
 
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
and there were 45 of the 733 that were
 
01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.189 align:start position:0%
and there were 45 of the 733 that were
undeliverable

01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
undeliverable
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
because something is undeliverable does
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
my i live in stratham my next door
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
neighbor does not have a
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
mailbox they have a pl box
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
and when you register to vote you
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
register with your address
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
so that person registering with their
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
address on the challenge voter affidavit
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
if you mail the postcard to them the
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
post office returns it because it's not
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
deliverable there's no mailbox
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
there so the um 45 that were returned
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
undeliverable were not necessarily
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
you know people who were not valid
 
01:48:40.159 --> 01:48:42.470 align:start position:0%
you know people who were not valid
voters

01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
is that to be corrected in the future
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
on the affidavit
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
um give an address
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a line for the
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
mailing address the uh the form of the
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
so you could change it
 
01:49:04.719 --> 01:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
so you could change it
yeah

01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative schultz of course your
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
voter registration
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
form does ask for both yes you have a
 
01:49:17.599 --> 01:49:18.550 align:start position:0%
form does ask for both yes you have a
separate

01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
but also in between the time that
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
somebody voted
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
and when we mailed out the letters we do
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
not get the letters out you know the
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
next week maybe in the next month it
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
takes a while to get you know with
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
everything that gets done at the end of
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
the election so somebody could have
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
moved um from the time that they voted
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
okay you could have lived in that town
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
for you know 40 years
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
you didn't have your id that time so you
 
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
had to fill up this thing and you've
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
moved from the time that we
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much have a
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
contribution for this
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself and
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
make your comments good afternoon my
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
name is samantha buckley i am here with
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
sure samantha buckley b u c k l e y
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:01.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i am here to discuss some concerns
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
with sb 418
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
sb 418 as it's currently written
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
will disenfranchise active military
 
01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:14.870 align:start position:0%
will disenfranchise active military
voters

01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
currently so for the uniform and
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
overseas citizens absentee voting act or
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
you acaba
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
it requires or guarantees active
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
military members
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
45 days as in 45 days prior to a federal
 
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:31.990 align:start position:0%
45 days as in 45 days prior to a federal
election

01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
their ballots must be mailed out
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
currently the way that sb14 is written
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
that can't happen
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
so certification
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
is 14 days after the primary that is 14
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
days after the primary and when you do
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
the math particularly for 2024
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
that means that those dates don't really
 
01:51:54.719 --> 01:51:55.750 align:start position:0%
that means that those dates don't really
work

01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
what would happen is essentially
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
the date of the required mailing would
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
occur prior to certification
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
and this actually that means that local
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
election officials will be forced to
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
decide do we send a ballot with
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
uncertified candidate names
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
or do we send a ballot late and be in
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
conflict and non-compliant with the
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
um 45 days is guaranteed by yuakawa
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
because federal lawmakers wanted service
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
members to have every opportunity to
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
receive their ballot in a timely manner
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
45 days is to protect against the
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
possibility of long-care mail carrier
 
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.030 align:start position:0%
possibility of long-care mail carrier
times

01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
specifically when mail is sent
 
01:52:38.639 --> 01:52:40.470 align:start position:0%
specifically when mail is sent
internationally

01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
internationally
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
decreasing this time even by a day
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
is federally non-compliant and endangers
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
service members opportunity to receive
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
their ballot in time
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
other concerns we do have other concerns
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
with sb 418
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
that would include
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
it is very well it's interesting that
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
the impact of sb 418
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps could be similar to 2017's
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
failed sb3 bill
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
which was determined to be
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by the new hampshire
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
supreme court and it cost new hampshire
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers 4.2 million dollars in legal
 
01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:18.390 align:start position:0%
taxpayers 4.2 million dollars in legal
fees

01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
and 4176
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
billable hours by the attorney general's
 
01:53:23.119 --> 01:53:25.510 align:start position:0%
billable hours by the attorney general's
office

01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
418 contains similar a similar impact to
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
2017's sb3 bill
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
which established a voter registration
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
process that occurs after the voter has
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
cast a ballot and requires the person to
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
provide documentation of their residency
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court did not
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
consider this new process to theater
 
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
voter fraud because the voters still
 
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
cast a ballot
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
other concerns would be that it may also
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
that sb 14 may endanger new hampshire's
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
exemption status of the national voter
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
in vra
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
it requires an expensive and cumbersome
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
voter registration requirement process
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
and that is something that new hampshire
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
currently is exempt from due to its
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
long-standing and robust same-day voter
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
registration process
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
and an unforeseen consequence of sb4418
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
if it is pushed to the courts is that
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
the courts may consider that
 
01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire no longer has that
 
01:54:28.239 --> 01:54:30.149 align:start position:0%
new hampshire no longer has that
exemption

01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
there are also state constitutional
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
concerns because new hampshire does
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
guarantee a voter confidentiality in
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
their ballot
 
01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:41.679 align:start position:0%
sb 418 provides a method and permission
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
for the state to know how a voter votes
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
the state may go in and essentially un
 
01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:51.350 align:start position:0%
the state may go in and essentially un
well

01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
basically take away the vote of someone
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
who's already cast their ballot
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
um considering all of this we are asking
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
that sb 418 be voted to be
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions yes
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
did you have an opportunity to bring
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
this all before the policy committee

02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
changing a system of any kind it's just
 
02:05:01.679 --> 02:05:02.709 align:start position:0%
changing a system of any kind it's just
changing

02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
changing
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement levels correct yes all
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that the pay sometimes
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
varies from county to county some
 
02:05:13.599 --> 02:05:14.629 align:start position:0%
varies from county to county some
counties

02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
counties
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
pay more than others
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
they pay their officers more than others
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
currently carroll county
 
02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:24.229 align:start position:0%
currently carroll county
um

02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:24.239 --> 02:05:25.830 align:start position:0%
um
pays

02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
pays
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
a part-time pay
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
and they're only reimbursed at this
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
65 level right now
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
um because
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
it would be almost impossible to hire
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
someone at
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
65 or 65 a day
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:05:44.159 --> 02:05:45.430 align:start position:0%
to do
basically

02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
police work
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
and i correct that even at these higher
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
rates of 60 and 120 the counties are
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
having a hard time recruiting enough
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
people to fill the open slots
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
there is currently in any job in uh this
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
country right now hard time to find uh
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
someone to hire but it certainly
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
makes it more palatable
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
and it
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
helps the counties
 
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
helps the counties
become

02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
become
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
not whole but
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
more complete
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
in their um
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
attempting to hire people
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman the reason i'm familiar with
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
this in the account my work in the
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
counties and i know that merrimack
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
county pays more than the rates the
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
reimburse rates and they still can't
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
fill the slots i've spoken recently
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
again with the sheriff and they're
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
having a terrible time getting enough
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
people to fill these slots and they're
 
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
as i say they're paying more than the
 
02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
rates that they're being reimbursed for
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%

02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%

02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
you okay
good

02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh the story starts in 2011 when we made
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
a number of changes to the retirement
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
system a large number of changes and for
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
group two we created
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
pension

02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
pension
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
data so when you how old you have to be
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
how long you have to serve how much you
 
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
earn for each year
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
between the vested employees which is
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
which who had the current
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
the previous law
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
the non-vested employees had a
 
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
significantly decreased benefit and the
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the interim we stare stepped it up
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
those people
 
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
who had been
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
who were hired but not yet
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
10 years of service in 2011 are now
 
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
approaching retirement
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
and they are concerned about this
 
02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:23.349 align:start position:0%
and they are concerned about this
so

02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it allows them to
 
02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:29.270 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it allows them to
buy

02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:30.389 align:start position:0%
 
service

02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
to lower the minimum age for retirement
 
02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:35.590 align:start position:0%
to lower the minimum age for retirement
or

02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:37.510 align:start position:0%
or
uh

02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
and and so forth
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
so forth so they can retire earlier or
 
02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
with a better benefit
 
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
the important thing that
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
you need to know is that they are
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
required to pay the full actuarial cost
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
of that change
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
so they can
 
02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
they can pay now and improve their their
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
pension for life retire earlier or work
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
longer their choice
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
and uh we thought that as long as they
 
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
were paying for it it was not
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to allow them to
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
buy service up to
 
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
what the people who were vested in 2011
 
02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:16.550 align:start position:0%
what the people who were vested in 2011
had

02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:16.560 --> 02:33:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:19.830 --> 02:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
try to answer questions appreciate your
 
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
comment because
 
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
here in finance we look at the
 
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes and it's got zero zero zero
 
02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
zero yes the only expense is a is some
 
02:33:29.359 --> 02:33:30.630 align:start position:0%
zero yes the only expense is a is some
programming

02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
programming
 
02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system to accomplish
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
this they're going to be paying the full
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
freight to the change to their benefit
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
we thought that was okay
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
it was worth spending a little money on
 
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
just as an aside do some of the people
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think of the bill number
 
02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:49.349 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think of the bill number
now

02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
where we
 
02:33:50.479 --> 02:33:51.910 align:start position:0%
where we
changed

02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
changed
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
the eligibility or the
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
retirement contributions
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
back to the 2011
 
02:34:02.630 --> 02:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
was that 1487 i no i don't know that
 
02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:03.510 align:start position:0%
was that 1487 i no i don't know that
number

02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
but 1587. but the contribution that each
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
retiree makes was set i believe in hb2
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
okay or something like that i just
 
02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
didn't know if this interface
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming some of the same people are
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
affected by both of those oh yes yes
 
02:34:19.359 --> 02:34:20.309 align:start position:0%
affected by both of those oh yes yes
however

02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
that was that was a change to how much
 
02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
over time they can credit toward their
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
creation yeah yeah
 
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
and there was a cost to it this is a
 
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
essentially no cost way for them to
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
improve their pension up to a certain
 
02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.429 align:start position:0%
improve their pension up to a certain
level

02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
at their own expense
 
02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any anybody else like to
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the record my
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
name is james demers and i'm here on
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire police
 
02:34:53.439 --> 02:34:54.870 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire police
association

02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire troopers
 
02:34:59.190 --> 02:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
association in support of this bill
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
um so you're right rarely do you have a
 
02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
bill that has a fiscal note that's all
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
zero so as you heard
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
the entire cost is paid for by the
 
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
individual who might
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
want to uh take advantage of this
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
to your point this is the exact same
 
02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:17.910 align:start position:0%
to your point this is the exact same
tier

02:35:17.910 --> 02:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
tier
 
02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
tier
that

02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
you did house bill 1587 that middle tier
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
and those are the individuals that you
 
02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
heard who when they were hired were
 
02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:28.790 align:start position:0%
heard who when they were hired were
hired

02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
hired
 
02:35:31.349 --> 02:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
with a belief that it was a 20-year
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
period to retirement and then they had
 
02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
years added on during that reform
 
02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
measure anywhere from one to four years
 
02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
so this bill as you heard
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
gives them the ability to
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
buy years above the 20 to get them down
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the 20 that they were hired under so
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
the expense is fully out of their pocket
 
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:52.790 align:start position:0%
the expense is fully out of their pocket
and

02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
the one point that i'd like to raise
 
02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:56.150 align:start position:0%
the one point that i'd like to raise
that

02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't brought up is that you've heard
 
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
through this entire year the challenges
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
that the state is facing
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement jobs
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
and retention has become a gigantic
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
issue and we're seeing now
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
a really rare situation where people are
 
02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:13.750 align:start position:0%
a really rare situation where people are
leaving

02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
02:36:17.429 --> 02:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
before they reach their 20 or 25 years
 
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we think this bill is another tool
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
that will help retain
 
02:36:23.670 --> 02:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
individuals if they're thinking about
 
02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:24.630 align:start position:0%
individuals if they're thinking about
leaving

02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
and they can buy
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
the four years to get them back down to
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
the 20
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
that may be enough to keep some of the
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
people on the job so we think it's an
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
important tool to help
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
retain troopers and police officers that
 
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
might be thinking about leaving early
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
questions just represented
 
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
just for my own interest um and i know
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
there's a variable because it depends on
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
their base pay etc but
 
02:36:48.399 --> 02:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
their base pay etc but
typically

02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
typically
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
can you answer how much that would cost
 
02:36:55.270 --> 02:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
to individual on average or a minimum
 
02:36:57.030 --> 02:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
maximum yes
 
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is not for everybody and i
 
02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
think there's a very small number of
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
people that will take advantage of it
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
because one of the estimates we heard is
 
02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
that it could be around forty thousand
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
so if somebody's buying four years it's
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
a significant sum of money it's a
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
significant if they buy one
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
but that gives you an idea that it's
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
probably going to be limited to a small
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:36.630 --> 02:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
you had a handout though yeah
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record uh marty carlin
 
02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:45.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record uh marty carlin
representing

02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh you nhrs a handout from the
 
02:37:48.070 --> 02:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system that sort of
 
02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
summarizes the
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
the change as well as the uh the number
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
of people affected by that and also
 
02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
explains how the that middle tier works
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of minimum age and minimum
 
02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
service for retirement so that
 
02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:02.230 align:start position:0%
service for retirement so that
their

02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
people who choose to elect to do this
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
would be buying back up to get them to
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know the old 45 and 20 or in some
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
increment closer to it you know if they
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
only want to buy one year instead of if
 
02:38:15.429 --> 02:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
they were eligible for more
 
02:38:17.429 --> 02:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
the reason that bill has an fn is the
 
02:38:17.439 --> 02:38:18.469 align:start position:0%
the reason that bill has an fn is the
original

02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
original
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
version uh introduced in the senate um
 
02:38:25.030 --> 02:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
had a calculation uh like a like a
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
set in set in stone
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
calculation for the service purchase
 
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
that the actuary thought didn't capture
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
the full cost so it had about a 12
 
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
million dollar price tag on the original
 
02:38:36.790 --> 02:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill the senate amended it so that it's
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
all on the member who chooses to buy it
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
okay anybody have any questions for mr
 
02:38:45.439 --> 02:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
okay anybody have any questions for mr
carlin

02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%

02:40:02.710 --> 02:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
yeah really i thought you would have
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise you know like sometimes i'm
 
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
here after a while
 
02:40:23.429 --> 02:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:23.439 --> 02:40:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
if

02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:56.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:40:56.790 --> 02:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay

okay marty could you spell your last
 
02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:06.870 align:start position:0%
okay marty could you spell your last
name

02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's why i asked i remember from
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
previous testimonies i'm going is it a k
 
02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
or c
 
02:41:27.269 --> 02:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:10.389 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

02:43:10.389 --> 02:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:10.399 --> 03:00:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
bye

03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:47.670 --> 03:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay being to 2 30 we'll start the work
 
03:00:52.150 --> 03:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here would like to
 
03:01:00.790 --> 03:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair carol mcguire
 
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
merrimack district 29
 
03:01:08.790 --> 03:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 443 is the result of a
 
03:01:12.070 --> 03:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
study committee last year on how we
 
03:01:14.710 --> 03:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
adopt updates to the building code
 
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:22.389 --> 03:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
the actual update was included in house
 
03:01:25.269 --> 03:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
bill 1681 which the senate has passed so
 
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have to worry about that this
 
03:01:29.190 --> 03:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
deals with some other
 
03:01:32.550 --> 03:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
issues that have become noticeable
 
03:01:34.750 --> 03:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
the first part is that
 
03:01:36.870 --> 03:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the authority to
 
03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:38.550 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the authority to
adopt

03:01:38.550 --> 03:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
03:01:42.309 --> 03:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
amendments to the state building code
 
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
in some cases the amendments have
 
03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:47.510 align:start position:0%
in some cases the amendments have
been

03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:48.870 align:start position:0%
been
incorrect

03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
03:01:51.269 --> 03:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
or in conflict with the building code
 
03:01:53.750 --> 03:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
not always usually there they're fine
 
03:01:55.910 --> 03:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
and you also end up with really bizarre
 
03:01:57.910 --> 03:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
cases where
 
03:02:00.870 --> 03:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's pelham and hudson where one
 
03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
town picks option a for how you do you
 
03:02:05.910 --> 03:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
contain electrical cables the other one
 
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
has option b
 
03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
and so on you've got to switch over from
 
03:02:13.429 --> 03:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
there they're both legitimate but having
 
03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
them next to each other is a problem and
 
03:02:18.870 --> 03:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
many people who work across the state
 
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
from contractors
 
03:02:25.110 --> 03:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
to electricians to building inspectors
 
03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a good way to find these
 
03:02:26.960 --> 03:02:28.070 align:start position:0%
don't have a good way to find these
amendments

03:02:28.070 --> 03:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:02:29.790 --> 03:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
some of them are on
 
03:02:31.910 --> 03:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities website some of them
 
03:02:33.910 --> 03:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
aren't so this would require the
 
03:02:35.990 --> 03:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
building code review board to actually
 
03:02:38.150 --> 03:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
look at these amendments
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
confirm that they are not in conflict
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
with the state building code
 
03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
and publish them so that every everybody
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
can look up and say okay i'm going to do
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
put up a building in
 
03:02:50.309 --> 03:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
in dover
 
03:02:52.469 --> 03:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
and this is the building code this is
 
03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
these are the amendments i have to
 
03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:54.790 align:start position:0%
these are the amendments i have to
follow

03:02:54.790 --> 03:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
and so that's much easier for everybody
 
03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
so this describes the process where that
 
03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:01.910 align:start position:0%
so this describes the process where that
happens

03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
happens
 
03:03:04.469 --> 03:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
the fire code is also in the same
 
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
situation so this
 
03:03:08.790 --> 03:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
adds that
 
03:03:12.230 --> 03:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
local amendments to the fire code are to
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
be reviewed by the
 
03:03:17.590 --> 03:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
state fire marshal and
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
because the board of fire control only
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
meets monthly
 
03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
and they don't or maybe it's less than
 
03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
that they don't meet very often and they
 
03:03:27.030 --> 03:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to to work on it
 
03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:28.070 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to to work on it
properly

03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
properly
 
03:03:29.429 --> 03:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
but the fire
 
03:03:31.190 --> 03:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
there are fewer amendments to the fire
 
03:03:34.870 --> 03:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
so this requires some act some
 
03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:38.830 align:start position:0%
so this requires some act some
administrative

03:03:38.830 --> 03:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
processes and
 
03:03:42.950 --> 03:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
the boards do not have the authority to
 
03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:43.990 align:start position:0%
the boards do not have the authority to
deny

03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
deny
 
03:03:46.950 --> 03:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
a valid building code
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
amendment this of the locality they can
 
03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
simply they can tell you
 
03:03:53.670 --> 03:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
it it conflicts with the state building
 
03:03:55.590 --> 03:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
code and therefore you can't adopt it
 
03:03:57.750 --> 03:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
but if it's in accordance with the state
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
building code or fire code they can only
 
03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:01.110 align:start position:0%
building code or fire code they can only
say

03:04:01.110 --> 03:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's a legitimate change
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
they might add under their breath but we
 
03:04:06.950 --> 03:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
think you're an idiot for doing it but
 
03:04:09.670 --> 03:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's but you can still do it
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
03:04:14.230 --> 03:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's yes but the towns have the
 
03:04:17.110 --> 03:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
authority to adopt any
 
03:04:21.190 --> 03:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh compatible amendment that they choose
 
03:04:22.710 --> 03:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
and which is
 
03:04:24.630 --> 03:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
why we left it that's it
 
03:04:27.269 --> 03:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
and the cost is simply for some clerical
 
03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
help the fire marshal and the state
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
board of fire control and the state
 
03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:33.190 align:start position:0%
board of fire control and the state
building

03:04:33.190 --> 03:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
building code review board have been
 
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
struggling for years with inadequate
 
03:04:42.870 --> 03:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:45.510 --> 03:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
express the need for more personnel
 
03:04:48.309 --> 03:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
the effect is as you got the revised
 
03:04:50.710 --> 03:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal mode it doesn't
 
03:04:52.950 --> 03:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
this isn't effective until january so
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're only talking a short period
 
03:04:57.269 --> 03:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
before the next budget
 
03:04:57.279 --> 03:04:58.790 align:start position:0%
before the next budget
um

03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
i will try to answer questions if you
 
03:05:02.070 --> 03:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
have any
 
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay just so you have uh mr hoffman
 
03:05:07.030 --> 03:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
passed out a supplemental fiscal
 
03:05:10.469 --> 03:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
statement that reflects the half here
 
03:05:10.479 --> 03:05:11.590 align:start position:0%
statement that reflects the half here
questions

03:05:11.590 --> 03:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative burris yeah thank you
 
03:05:17.269 --> 03:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman just a
 
03:05:20.469 --> 03:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
question out of curiosity can a town
 
03:05:23.910 --> 03:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
pass a more stringent code
 
03:05:26.309 --> 03:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
they can only pass a more stringent code
 
03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
unless they fire unless the code has
 
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
options in which case they can pick any
 
03:05:34.230 --> 03:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
of them they like but in general their
 
03:05:36.630 --> 03:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
their amendments must be
 
03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
congruent with or stricter than the
 
03:05:42.070 --> 03:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
represented walls
 
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
um so i know representative mcwilliams
 
03:05:49.510 --> 03:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
mothers have tried to
 
03:05:51.429 --> 03:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
pass updates to the building code and
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
the fire code and my question is
 
03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
was that if they did that
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
what it had do you know if it would have
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
standardized the codes here's my concern
 
03:06:02.950 --> 03:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
is it sounds like we have
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
almost a different code in every town
 
03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
and is there a way that we can
 
03:06:08.550 --> 03:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
standardize it throughout the state and
 
03:06:09.670 --> 03:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
is that what they were trying to do in
 
03:06:11.110 --> 03:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
the past
 
03:06:11.120 --> 03:06:11.830 align:start position:0%
the past
i

03:06:11.830 --> 03:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
have no idea what they were trying to do
 
03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
this year this year we adopted the 2018
 
03:06:21.190 --> 03:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
building codes
 
03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:21.990 align:start position:0%
building codes
and

03:06:21.990 --> 03:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:23.510 align:start position:0%
and
statewide

03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
and that's that is in house bill 1681
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
and and and any town that has an
 
03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to the building code will
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
probably need to look at
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
if it's still necessary regarding the
 
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
update to the code
 
03:06:37.840 --> 03:06:39.030 align:start position:0%
update to the code
the

03:06:39.030 --> 03:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:41.269 --> 03:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of changes and issues
 
03:06:41.279 --> 03:06:42.550 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of changes and issues
because

03:06:42.550 --> 03:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
we kept the 2009 building code through
 
03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:57.030 --> 03:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah now we we we're on
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're slightly behind because we found
 
03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
that if you
 
03:07:04.230 --> 03:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
the state that the building codes
 
03:07:06.070 --> 03:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
have some some issues when they first
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
come out so we want to be
 
03:07:10.389 --> 03:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
at least two years after the code's
 
03:07:10.399 --> 03:07:12.469 align:start position:0%
at least two years after the code's
adopted

03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
so there the building code review board
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
is thinking about when they should start
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
looking at the 2021 codes
 
03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
other questions and this is the
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
international building code is that the
 
03:07:27.990 --> 03:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
who is it the international building
 
03:07:30.630 --> 03:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
code or just the national
 
03:07:30.640 --> 03:07:31.590 align:start position:0%
code or just the national
yeah

03:07:31.590 --> 03:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
most of them are international right um
 
03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:35.429 align:start position:0%
most of them are international right um
it's

03:07:35.429 --> 03:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:07:37.349 --> 03:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's not in this bill it's it's
 
03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
specified in house bill 1681 right that
 
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
was just a curiosity question i think
 
03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're international yeah
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:07:47.349 --> 03:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:07:49.269 --> 03:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
anyone else like to speak on this
 
03:07:49.279 --> 03:07:50.830 align:start position:0%
anyone else like to speak on this
representative

03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:07:54.070 --> 03:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
griffin i opened my cutting even sure i
 
03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
think are we ready for a motion i think
 
03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
we have some uh there's probably some
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.910 --> 03:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else like to make a comment
 
03:08:08.230 --> 03:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
until we run out of time then we're not
 
03:08:11.030 --> 03:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
eaters at all
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon brian allen from the fire
 
03:08:15.030 --> 03:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
marshal's office uh the fire marshal is

here this week he's away on vacation
 
03:08:26.710 --> 03:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh we just want to speak to the
 
03:08:29.190 --> 03:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note uh as
 
03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
as was brought up just uh prior to me
 
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
speaking is you know we do have this
 
03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
would be an extra demand on our staff uh
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
which is already uh at capacity now so
 
03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
we just want to stress that if there's
 
03:08:43.269 --> 03:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
any questions i could answer with
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
03:08:46.830 --> 03:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note i'm happy to do
 
03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
that you have any questions
 
03:08:51.670 --> 03:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you
 
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:57.590 --> 03:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
my name is gary abbott i'm the executive
 
03:09:03.670 --> 03:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
vice president of the associated general
 
03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
contractors of new hampshire
 
03:09:07.910 --> 03:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
i've been supportive of this bill all
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
the way through the process
 
03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
in support of the department and
 
03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
personnel to do this
 
03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're right it's the international
 
03:09:17.830 --> 03:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
billing codes which is the the main
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
codes for commercial residential
 
03:09:23.110 --> 03:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
and those associated codes
 
03:09:24.950 --> 03:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
there are different codes for like the
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
fire codes and those kind of things so
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's why under 1681 you'll find all
 
03:09:31.590 --> 03:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
the different codes
 
03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
clearly this is a great thing from the
 
03:09:36.710 --> 03:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
construction aspect if we can find all
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
the amendments in one location
 
03:09:40.950 --> 03:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
through the state building code review
 
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
board and file that the department of
 
03:09:46.150 --> 03:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
safety the other issue is is i have a
 
03:09:48.229 --> 03:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative on the building code
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
review board
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
and they are already looking at the 2021
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
international building codes
 
03:09:57.670 --> 03:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
so it's going through the review process
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
very optimistic that now that we're
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
getting back on track and keeping up
 
03:10:04.389 --> 03:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
we won't have the problems that were
 
03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
discussed a little earlier regarding
 
03:10:07.510 --> 03:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
being behind
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
in towns trying to do an effort to catch
 
03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
up if the state is catching up there
 
03:10:13.710 --> 03:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
won't be any reason for the
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities to put in a lot of
 
03:10:18.550 --> 03:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
amendments so that's the hope
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
and with that i would hope the committee
 
03:10:24.070 --> 03:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
supports the bill okay any questions
 
03:10:24.080 --> 03:10:24.830 align:start position:0%
supports the bill okay any questions
thank

03:10:24.830 --> 03:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:29.439 --> 03:10:36.550 align:start position:0%
 
please

03:10:36.550 --> 03:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
my name is phillip sherman i'm the chair
 
03:10:40.710 --> 03:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board
 
03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
this bill reflects many hours working
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
with eight representative groups and
 
03:10:46.309 --> 03:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
many individuals to correct a
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
long-standing problem in new hampshire
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
a building on what representative
 
03:10:52.150 --> 03:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
mcguire said currently there's
 
03:10:54.150 --> 03:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions where regulations are
 
03:10:56.229 --> 03:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
adopted without going through the
 
03:11:00.870 --> 03:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
ordinance process as required by rsa 674
 
03:11:02.950 --> 03:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
and statutory requirements that
 
03:11:05.830 --> 03:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances be forwarded to the bcrb
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
basically for posting on the website
 
03:11:10.389 --> 03:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
have been satisfied by a grand total of
 
03:11:12.870 --> 03:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
two jurisdictions i think portsmouth and
 
03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:18.630 align:start position:0%
two jurisdictions i think portsmouth and
durham

03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
further some local ordinances do not
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
even reflect the current state codes
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly significant city not
 
03:11:26.910 --> 03:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
too far from here that still posted the
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
2009 codes this bill therefore reflects
 
03:11:33.750 --> 03:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
a desire for some level of bcrb review
 
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
of local amendments to the building and
 
03:11:39.269 --> 03:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
also the fire codes the bcrb consists of
 
03:11:41.670 --> 03:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
17 volunteer members
 
03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
with administrative support from the
 
03:11:45.349 --> 03:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
state fire marshal's office
 
03:11:48.150 --> 03:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
while many of the 234 towns and cities
 
03:11:50.309 --> 03:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
do not have code amendments you can't
 
03:11:52.150 --> 03:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
you can't have a code amendment unless
 
03:11:54.389 --> 03:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
you have the whole building inspector
 
03:11:54.399 --> 03:11:56.790 align:start position:0%
you have the whole building inspector
package

03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
package
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with the ones that do will
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
require support by staff having an
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of the technical aspects
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the code in other words in excess of
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
the clerical support that we currently
 
03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:08.070 align:start position:0%
the clerical support that we currently
receive

03:12:08.070 --> 03:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
receive
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
so speaking on the building code side we
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
support this strongly and i think
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's a very real problem out there
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
and this is the way to fix it
 
03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:22.950 align:start position:0%
and this is the way to fix it
how

03:12:22.950 --> 03:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:24.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:12:24.469 --> 03:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
i have a couple architects that live
 
03:12:29.110 --> 03:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
within my constituency and uh
 
03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
one of them a couple times has come
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
where he's having problems with
 
03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:33.910 align:start position:0%
where he's having problems with
communities

03:12:33.910 --> 03:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:12:37.030 --> 03:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
outside my area that
 
03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:37.830 align:start position:0%
outside my area that
this

03:12:37.830 --> 03:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
exact problem exists their current
 
03:12:41.590 --> 03:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
building codes
 
03:12:43.349 --> 03:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
are not current
 
03:12:44.469 --> 03:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
the ones that the municipality
 
03:12:46.950 --> 03:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities using what resource does
 
03:12:48.389 --> 03:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
he have to
 
03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
address that other than going to the
 
03:12:53.670 --> 03:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
state he's had he's frustrated um and i
 
03:12:54.710 --> 03:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've experienced this
 
03:12:55.990 --> 03:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
before but
 
03:12:58.710 --> 03:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
i i suspect and this is just a personal
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
opinion that much of that problem
 
03:13:03.750 --> 03:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
our jurisdictions that are enforcing the
 
03:13:05.349 --> 03:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
state building go their websites are
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
just out of date
 
03:13:09.190 --> 03:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
like everybody those things tend to get
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
stale and forgotten about
 
03:13:13.590 --> 03:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh i'm there may be towns that are
 
03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
literally enforcing out-of-date codes in
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
which case they need a phone call to
 
03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
just bring them up to speed
 
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh this gets more to the local amendment
 
03:13:22.960 --> 03:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh this gets more to the local amendment
problem

03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
where as others have have indicated
 
03:13:29.030 --> 03:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
frequently the building or the fire
 
03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
official will just say this is what i
 
03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
want and whereas the rsa requires those
 
03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
amendments to go through the local
 
03:13:37.349 --> 03:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
ordinance process
 
03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
and then in terms of the need for a
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
central repository so that you know a
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
person can figure out what's going on
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
it's just not being complied with even
 
03:13:49.349 --> 03:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
for informational purposes
 
03:13:51.510 --> 03:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
03:13:51.520 --> 03:13:53.190 align:start position:0%
for the most part
thanks

03:13:53.190 --> 03:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's not precisely
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
what i had i'm happy to give this to you
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
it would just go in the folder if
 
03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:10.800 --> 03:14:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you steve levoy i'm
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
the director of administration for the
 
03:14:22.229 --> 03:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:27.030 --> 03:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
named sure lavoy lav as in victor o-i-e
 
03:14:27.040 --> 03:14:28.950 align:start position:0%
named sure lavoy lav as in victor o-i-e
yep

03:14:28.950 --> 03:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
um and just as assistant director allard
 
03:14:32.550 --> 03:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know the department is
 
03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
fully in support of of the bill i just
 
03:14:36.309 --> 03:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure the committee was
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
aware the fiscal note that's attached is
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
not funded and the position is not
 
03:14:43.429 --> 03:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
authorized in the current language
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
so if we were to receive that position
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
there would need to be an amendment made
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
so as of now there is no administrative
 
03:14:52.389 --> 03:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
support for this function within
 
03:14:54.150 --> 03:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
the division of fire safety in the fire
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
marshal's office
 
03:14:58.780 --> 03:14:58.790 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:15:00.870 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
[Music]

03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
because what we're voting on is a
 
03:15:02.160 --> 03:15:03.429 align:start position:0%
because what we're voting on is a
position

03:15:03.429 --> 03:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:15:04.950 --> 03:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
and you're you're saying that position
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist or so that takes a
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
different an additional
 
03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:10.150 align:start position:0%
different an additional
amendment

03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:15:12.389 --> 03:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
so the language in the bill
 
03:15:14.710 --> 03:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
right right now does not speak to that
 
03:15:14.720 --> 03:15:15.990 align:start position:0%
right right now does not speak to that
position

03:15:15.990 --> 03:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:15:19.510 --> 03:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note brought it forward as a
 
03:15:19.520 --> 03:15:20.389 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note brought it forward as a
concern

03:15:20.389 --> 03:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:15:21.990 --> 03:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
that the department had about meeting
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the bill so this
 
03:15:25.269 --> 03:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be nice to have
 
03:15:29.670 --> 03:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
not what is we we would say it's a
 
03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
well i'm a little confused but right now
 
03:15:39.429 --> 03:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
in finance before us it says here's what
 
03:15:41.590 --> 03:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
we might spend over the next couple of
 
03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:42.790 align:start position:0%
we might spend over the next couple of
years

03:15:42.790 --> 03:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're voting on
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if the position doesn't exist
 
03:15:51.030 --> 03:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman do you have a
 
03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:54.229 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman do you have a
thought

03:15:54.229 --> 03:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
thought
 
03:15:57.349 --> 03:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
the bill does not establish a position
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
or make an appropriation
 
03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
department of safety submitted the
 
03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal information
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
that says
 
03:16:07.830 --> 03:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do this we need this
 
03:16:10.790 --> 03:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
position it's going to cost us that
 
03:16:10.800 --> 03:16:11.670 align:start position:0%
position it's going to cost us that
so

03:16:11.670 --> 03:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:14.550 --> 03:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
if it were passed
 
03:16:26.229 --> 03:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:28.870 --> 03:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
approval and actuality okay because i
 
03:16:30.070 --> 03:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
was sitting there thinking all of a
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
sudden we got to report this out three
 
03:16:33.750 --> 03:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
o'clock tomorrow afternoon and you want
 
03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
us to create a position
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's going to happen
 
03:16:39.269 --> 03:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
if we approve the appropriation then at
 
03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
if we approve the appropriation then at
least

03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
least
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
well what are we
 
03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:50.960 align:start position:0%

03:16:52.950 --> 03:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
oh okay so we're not voting anything the
 
03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%

okay so we're posted to full finance
 
03:18:40.870 --> 03:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at three o'clock has ought to
 
03:18:40.880 --> 03:18:42.229 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at three o'clock has ought to
pass

03:18:42.229 --> 03:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
pass
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
and so that ends the work session on
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
four four three
 
03:30:24.469 --> 03:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:26.469 --> 03:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
i'll open the work session on senate
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill 438
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
and ask anybody that would like to
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
contribute wisdom and knowledge to us
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
you have to turn the mic on
 
03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
there you go and if you introduce
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
yourselves for the clerk and he's
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
probably going to ask you how to spell
 
03:30:52.950 --> 03:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh house finance

the steel fabricators of new england i'm
 
03:31:06.150 --> 03:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
here with holly novoleski of novel iron
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
and stephen chasey of s.l chasey steele

generational family businesses
 
03:31:13.040 --> 03:31:15.190 align:start position:0%
generational family businesses
um

03:31:15.190 --> 03:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:17.269 --> 03:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
my testimony will be with respect to
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
opposing arguments that we may have
 
03:31:19.120 --> 03:31:20.070 align:start position:0%
opposing arguments that we may have
heard

03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
heard
 
03:31:23.110 --> 03:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh over the past few months as we've
 
03:31:24.630 --> 03:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
tried to promote our bill
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
i just want to take an opportunity
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
some of your time to discuss some of
 
03:31:30.070 --> 03:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
these arguments i'll try to stay
 
03:31:33.190 --> 03:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
respectful of your time of course and um
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
focus really on the fiscal
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:40.870 --> 03:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
one of the um one of the arguments we
 
03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
heard was um basically about economic
 
03:31:43.120 --> 03:31:44.150 align:start position:0%
heard was um basically about economic
ignorance

03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
ignorance
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
actually this this bill is is really to
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
correct that and come back with
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
responsible economics uh simply put
 
03:31:53.429 --> 03:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
keeping tax dollars in our new hampshire
 
03:31:53.439 --> 03:31:54.870 align:start position:0%
keeping tax dollars in our new hampshire
communities

03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
is keeping local people employed you
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
know they in turn spend within their own
 
03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
communities and it's called the economic
 
03:32:00.560 --> 03:32:02.630 align:start position:0%
communities and it's called the economic
multiplier

03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
multiplier
 
03:32:04.630 --> 03:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
in economic multipliers for every dollar
 
03:32:04.640 --> 03:32:05.830 align:start position:0%
in economic multipliers for every dollar
spent

03:32:05.830 --> 03:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
spent
 
03:32:07.590 --> 03:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
in our communities a dollar fifty is
 
03:32:09.429 --> 03:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
generated right here in our local
 
03:32:11.190 --> 03:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
communities i believe holly novoletsky
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
is gonna expand upon that
 
03:32:13.200 --> 03:32:14.550 align:start position:0%
is gonna expand upon that
um

03:32:14.550 --> 03:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:16.150 --> 03:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
if these dollars leave our country
 
03:32:16.160 --> 03:32:17.429 align:start position:0%
if these dollars leave our country
though

03:32:17.429 --> 03:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
zero is generated in our community and
 
03:32:23.110 --> 03:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing ignorant about that
 
03:32:24.950 --> 03:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
another argument that we heard was it
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
will impede economic growth
 
03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
to the contrary it will foster economic
 
03:32:30.160 --> 03:32:31.190 align:start position:0%
to the contrary it will foster economic
growth

03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
growth
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
um and really uh if that will speak for
 
03:32:37.110 --> 03:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
itself you know um
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
conversely you know we're funding the
 
03:32:40.150 --> 03:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
growth of canadian businesses and
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
economies at our own expense with these
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
tax dollars that we pay on these public
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
construction projects
 
03:32:47.670 --> 03:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
another argument is
 
03:32:49.429 --> 03:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
money versus wealth
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
money flowing out of the country might
 
03:32:53.510 --> 03:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
be a good thing
 
03:32:56.309 --> 03:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
i say might be good
 
03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
any tax dollar flowing out of our
 
03:32:59.830 --> 03:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
country at any rate is never a good
 
03:33:01.830 --> 03:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
thing there is no economic multiplier
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
benefit from it
 
03:33:06.630 --> 03:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
another argument is
 
03:33:09.670 --> 03:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill will raise costs
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
no it won't this is a short-sighted
 
03:33:11.279 --> 03:33:12.710 align:start position:0%
no it won't this is a short-sighted
response

03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
response
 
03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:14.070 align:start position:0%
response
negligible

03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
negligible
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
initial savings on publicly funded
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
construction projects
 
03:33:20.550 --> 03:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
will disappear
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
you will not get an economic multiply in
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
fact in the long run saving a little
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
upfront obviously will cost us more
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
later on
 
03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
our economic activity will far exceed
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
any discount of the purchase of fabric
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
another argument is the seen versus
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
unforeseen effect prices will rise and
 
03:33:46.469 --> 03:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
taxes will increase no
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
projects will be competitively
 
03:33:50.229 --> 03:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
competitively priced and new hampshire
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
will not need to increase taxes because
 
03:33:54.150 --> 03:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
of this legislation
 
03:33:56.070 --> 03:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's more likely that new hampshire will
 
03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
see an increase in tax revenues
 
03:34:02.309 --> 03:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
generated by this economic activity
 
03:34:03.750 --> 03:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
another argument
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
cited unprecedented delays on projects
 
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
due to strained supply chains
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
again no
 
03:34:12.950 --> 03:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
it will help rebuild and strengthen our
 
03:34:14.870 --> 03:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
supply chains we learned from the
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
one would say this bill is subsidizing
 
03:34:23.590 --> 03:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
an industry
 
03:34:25.190 --> 03:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in our bill that
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
requires uh or requests a subsidy or tax
 
03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
break um
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
on on you know on our behalf
 
03:34:32.160 --> 03:34:33.190 align:start position:0%
on on you know on our behalf
um

03:34:33.190 --> 03:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is only protecting four
 
03:34:34.960 --> 03:34:36.389 align:start position:0%
this bill is only protecting four
fabricators

03:34:36.389 --> 03:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
fabricators
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
again no there were four of us
 
03:34:40.710 --> 03:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
championing this bill however we
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
represent over 22 other steel
 
03:34:44.550 --> 03:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
fabricators in the state of new
 
03:34:46.870 --> 03:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire minimum 22 i should say and
 
03:34:49.830 --> 03:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
over 900 employees
 
03:34:51.750 --> 03:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
the economic multiplier ripples through
 
03:34:53.910 --> 03:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
the industry and will have a positive
 
03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
economic impact on the residents of new
 
03:34:56.560 --> 03:34:59.750 align:start position:0%
economic impact on the residents of new
hampshire

03:34:59.750 --> 03:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
i like this one
 
03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
we should thank canada for their low
 
03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:06.469 align:start position:0%
we should thank canada for their low
prices

03:35:06.469 --> 03:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:09.429 --> 03:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
you can thank them for using our own tax
 
03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to support canadian communities
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes you can thank canadi that you can
 
03:35:15.190 --> 03:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank them when canadian steel
 
03:35:18.070 --> 03:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
fabricators put us out of business using
 
03:35:21.190 --> 03:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:24.229 --> 03:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
canada does subsidize its industries and
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
at a power at a minimum with power
 
03:35:28.870 --> 03:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
electric electricity and natural gas and
 
03:35:31.190 --> 03:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
03:35:33.670 --> 03:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
this alone won't solve our problem here
 
03:35:35.190 --> 03:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
but at least it'll give us a fighting
 
03:35:35.200 --> 03:35:36.309 align:start position:0%
but at least it'll give us a fighting
chance

03:35:36.309 --> 03:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
chance
 
03:35:39.030 --> 03:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
capone irons own health insurance
 
03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
premium increased 24 percent this year
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're paying close to one million
 
03:35:44.469 --> 03:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
dollars this year for our health
 
03:35:44.479 --> 03:35:45.590 align:start position:0%
dollars this year for our health
insurance

03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:46.630 align:start position:0%
insurance
so

03:35:46.630 --> 03:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:48.870 --> 03:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
ace you know any sort of um
 
03:35:51.030 --> 03:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
argument against health insurance
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
or power or anything like that would be
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
negligible but it would help us it would
 
03:35:58.229 --> 03:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:59.590 --> 03:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
i'll leave you with these last few
 
03:35:59.600 --> 03:36:01.110 align:start position:0%
i'll leave you with these last few
thoughts

03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
03:36:03.429 --> 03:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is focused on the responsible
 
03:36:05.030 --> 03:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
spending of our tax dollars on
 
03:36:07.429 --> 03:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
structural steel fabrication products
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
keeping our tax dollars in our state
 
03:36:12.150 --> 03:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
will yield positive results in our local
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
and regional communities
 
03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
outside of a one-time potential upfront
 
03:36:17.439 --> 03:36:18.550 align:start position:0%
outside of a one-time potential upfront
discount

03:36:18.550 --> 03:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
discount
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
realized by buying fabricated steel from
 
03:36:23.349 --> 03:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
north of the border there is no economic
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
gain to our communities once that money
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
is spent
 
03:36:29.190 --> 03:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
competitive pricing practices project
 
03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
schedules material availability quality
 
03:36:34.150 --> 03:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
and capacity will not be compromised as
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill has waivers to protect both
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
public and pr the public and project's
 
03:36:38.160 --> 03:36:39.910 align:start position:0%
public and pr the public and project's
interests

03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
interests
 
03:36:42.469 --> 03:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
again a short term expense
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
for a long-term gain
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
when our tax revenue expenditures
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
replenish our economies and communities
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
not communities in another country this
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
positive cycle will just keep going
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
employees will keep working spending
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
their money in our communities and will
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
continue to stabilize our economy
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%

03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity to speak
 
03:37:57.190 --> 03:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
buy american is a bipartisan value
 
03:38:01.750 --> 03:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 438 is a buy american bill
 
03:38:03.830 --> 03:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
it will support and protect american
 
03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
jobs american manufacturing
 
03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
and the american economy
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
senate bill 438 is about good
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at it as short-term versus
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
long-term investment short-term
 
03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
investment would be if you buy the
 
03:38:23.670 --> 03:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
cheaper steel
 
03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
from a foreign company
 
03:38:27.670 --> 03:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
but that money goes out of them out of
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
the country and is not reinvested
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
long-term investment strategy pays
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
dividends to our local economy it
 
03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
preserves and creates better paying jobs
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
it has a multiplying effect in the local
 
03:38:40.880 --> 03:38:42.389 align:start position:0%
it has a multiplying effect in the local
community

03:38:42.389 --> 03:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
supporting local businesses and it
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
increases the state's tax revenue
 
03:38:47.760 --> 03:38:49.189 align:start position:0%
increases the state's tax revenue
by

03:38:49.189 --> 03:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
by foregoing the immediate gratification
 
03:38:57.830 --> 03:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
of cheaper upfront price for steel the
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
long-term reinvestment in our
 
03:39:01.349 --> 03:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturing base and middle class will
 
03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
strengthen the economy encourage
 
03:39:02.960 --> 03:39:04.349 align:start position:0%
strengthen the economy encourage
repatriating

03:39:04.349 --> 03:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
repatriating
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
repatriating that's a tongue twister
 
03:39:08.279 --> 03:39:10.070 align:start position:0%
repatriating that's a tongue twister
manufacturing

03:39:10.070 --> 03:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
03:39:13.269 --> 03:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
and grow our middle class
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
i submitted last night my testimony so
 
03:39:17.830 --> 03:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
you have all of it but i would like to
 
03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
offer i have an example
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
from real life that i can go through
 
03:39:24.550 --> 03:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
with you on a job that was a new
 
03:39:26.070 --> 03:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based job
 
03:39:28.150 --> 03:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
that went canadian that we lost i can go
 
03:39:29.750 --> 03:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
through that with you or
 
03:39:31.030 --> 03:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
if you'd like
 
03:39:31.040 --> 03:39:32.229 align:start position:0%
if you'd like
okay

03:39:32.229 --> 03:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:39:34.389 --> 03:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
so recently we bid a job
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it was the nashua
 
03:39:38.070 --> 03:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
middle school we bid it last year for
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
delivery this summer
 
03:39:42.389 --> 03:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
we came in third the first two were four
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
and they were canadian
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
our price was five hundred thousand
 
03:39:46.479 --> 03:39:47.910 align:start position:0%
our price was five hundred thousand
dollars

03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
more than the neck than the winning bid
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
our price was 6.9 million
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
if you think about uh the difference
 
03:39:59.269 --> 03:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
between 6.9 and 6.4 which was the
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
winning bid it was 7.5 price
 
03:40:01.680 --> 03:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
winning bid it was 7.5 price
differentiation

03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
differentiation
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
steel tends to be 10
 
03:40:10.189 --> 03:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
of the overall project cost so for
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
0.75 percent we lost the bid of an
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
increase to the project
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
but what was lost was more to the state
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
and when you include employee wages that
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
were gone towards building that school
 
03:40:27.189 --> 03:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
which were 20 and this is just sharp
 
03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is not my office
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
this is just the shop wages
 
03:40:33.550 --> 03:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
we lost
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
250 000 in wages shop wages for that job
 
03:40:42.870 --> 03:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
with an average federal tax of 15
 
03:40:42.880 --> 03:40:44.469 align:start position:0%
with an average federal tax of 15
percent

03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
lost one thousand dollars
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire bet one thousand two
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
hundred sixty dollars
 
03:40:53.110 --> 03:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire
 
03:40:53.120 --> 03:40:54.790 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire
bt

03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
bt
 
03:40:57.990 --> 03:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
bpt i'm dyslexic sorry um on that
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
contract the profit 10 on a 6.9 million
 
03:41:04.710 --> 03:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
dollar project was 53 million dollars
 
03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire unemployment one
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
percent was 2500 for a total of 337 990
 
03:41:14.550 --> 03:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
just on the shop costs
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
that the state lost
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
when you look at the multiplier effect
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
that stephen was talking about
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
so for every one dollar of can paid
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
for construction a dollar fifty is
 
03:41:28.150 --> 03:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
recirculated through respending into the
 
03:41:28.160 --> 03:41:29.670 align:start position:0%
recirculated through respending into the
economy

03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
economy
 
03:41:32.469 --> 03:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
if you look at the price
 
03:41:34.710 --> 03:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
our bid price was 6.9 million the
 
03:41:35.990 --> 03:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
canadians were
 
03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
6.4 we backed out the erection because
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
both of us would have used domestic
 
03:41:43.269 --> 03:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
erection so we took that price out to be
 
03:41:43.279 --> 03:41:45.030 align:start position:0%
erection so we took that price out to be
conservative

03:41:45.030 --> 03:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
03:41:50.790 --> 03:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
and you apply the 1.5 percent 1.5 um
 
03:41:52.630 --> 03:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
what the state lost
 
03:41:58.229 --> 03:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
was eight million four hundred and sixty
 
03:42:00.150 --> 03:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars and five hundred
 
03:42:02.309 --> 03:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
dollars in reinvesting through the
 
03:42:05.110 --> 03:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect in the local community
 
03:42:06.630 --> 03:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:42:08.150 --> 03:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to be even more conservative and
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
take the five hundred thousand dollars
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
that they saved up front you're still
 
03:42:13.670 --> 03:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
looking at almost eight million dollars

senate bill 438 creates jobs

anywhere from 1.25 to 1.30
 
03:43:10.880 --> 03:43:12.150 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 1.25 to 1.30

03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
senator i didn't see you sitting over
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%

03:43:40.229 --> 03:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh for the record
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
my name is senator tom sherman i'm the
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill
 
03:43:46.640 --> 03:43:48.790 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill
um

03:43:48.790 --> 03:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
and um i represent district 24
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:56.640 --> 03:43:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
this

03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
is a
 
03:44:01.830 --> 03:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan or bipartisan bill that
 
03:44:03.750 --> 03:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes that in new hampshire we have
 
03:44:07.110 --> 03:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
four major steel fabricating plants
 
03:44:09.750 --> 03:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
one of these is in my district and holly
 
03:44:09.760 --> 03:44:10.469 align:start position:0%
one of these is in my district and holly
is

03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
the ceo and owner of that
 
03:44:15.990 --> 03:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
i had a tour of this complex following a
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
discussion with holly
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
the companies are responsible employers
 
03:44:24.150 --> 03:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
with dedicated employees
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
but they're competing with foreign
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers for work in new hampshire
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
and across new england
 
03:44:31.269 --> 03:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
i learned that the playing field is
 
03:44:32.950 --> 03:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
anything but level
 
03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
with many of these foreign producers due
 
03:44:37.349 --> 03:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
to government support favorable tax
 
03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
structures and or exchange rates able to
 
03:44:42.070 --> 03:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
offer their products
 
03:44:44.950 --> 03:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
at such low prices that our own in-state
 
03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers can't compete
 
03:44:50.070 --> 03:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
our granite state fabricators have
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
compelling stories which they have
 
03:44:54.389 --> 03:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
shared with you of being unable to bid
 
03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
for contracts even in the cities and
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities in which their factories
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
are located
 
03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
the concept behind the bill is not new
 
03:45:05.030 --> 03:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
it is standard of practice for federal
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
highway projects
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
in fact over on the senate side we had
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
d.o.t come and help us with the
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that you see before you
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
recently there's been a movement in
 
03:45:19.349 --> 03:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
state legislators legislatures across
 
03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
the country to level the playing field
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
to support american-made products by
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they are utilized in these
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
publicly funded projects
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
no impact on private projects
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
one critical lesson we've learned during
 
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
covid is the price of outsourcing
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturing beyond our u.s borders
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's ppe plexiglas ventilators
 
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
or other products essential to
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
protecting the health of americans
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic the lack of
 
03:45:48.150 --> 03:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
availability within the united states
 
03:45:50.309 --> 03:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
created significant barriers
 
03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
to access during the crisis
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
and persistent broad foreign supply
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
chain shortages
 
03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
continue to drive up consumer prices at
 
03:45:59.359 --> 03:46:01.349 align:start position:0%
continue to drive up consumer prices at
home

03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:46:04.150 --> 03:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
supporting us-based manufacturing as
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
anticipated in this bill especially new
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based manufacturing ensures
 
03:46:09.910 --> 03:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
that there will be high quality
 
03:46:09.920 --> 03:46:11.030 align:start position:0%
that there will be high quality
production

03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
production
 
03:46:13.590 --> 03:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
on american soil supports local job
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
growth with excellent wages and benefits
 
03:46:18.550 --> 03:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
and represents a direct investment in
 
03:46:21.429 --> 03:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
our own businesses and economy
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
while some may claim this may drive up
 
03:46:26.150 --> 03:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
choi uh costs at least 21 states have
 
03:46:28.229 --> 03:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
laws that require government preference
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
for american-made materials and products
 
03:46:33.750 --> 03:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
38 states have in-state procurement
 
03:46:35.990 --> 03:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
preference for manufacturers
 
03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:36.950 align:start position:0%
preference for manufacturers
and

03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
as holly said there is a return on
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
investment that's
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
pretty remarkable at uh one and a half
 
03:46:46.150 --> 03:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
dollars for every dollar spent
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
similar legislation passed recently in
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
new jersey and did so unanimously in
 
03:46:50.720 --> 03:46:51.990 align:start position:0%
new jersey and did so unanimously in
texas

03:46:51.990 --> 03:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
texas
 
03:46:53.590 --> 03:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
it is now under consideration in
 
03:46:56.309 --> 03:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts interestingly countries
 
03:46:58.469 --> 03:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
that represent current foreign sources
 
03:47:00.150 --> 03:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
of similar products
 
03:47:01.830 --> 03:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
often allow their regional governments
 
03:47:04.309 --> 03:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
and provinces to pass the exact same
 
03:47:07.590 --> 03:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
type of guard rails
 
03:47:09.429 --> 03:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
contemplated in this bill to support
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
their own local industries in other
 
03:47:13.510 --> 03:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
words we can't compete
 
03:47:15.990 --> 03:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the countries that are
 
03:47:18.630 --> 03:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
competing with us here at home
 
03:47:20.469 --> 03:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
this is not simply a matter of new
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire jobs and businesses it has
 
03:47:23.910 --> 03:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
grown to be an issue of national
 
03:47:26.309 --> 03:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
economic security
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
in the senate after introducing sb 438
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
and hearing the testimony from
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
contractors and the municipal
 
03:47:35.110 --> 03:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
association as well as others
 
03:47:38.070 --> 03:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
we all sat down together with senator
 
03:47:38.080 --> 03:47:39.750 align:start position:0%
we all sat down together with senator
carson

03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
carson
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
and amended the bill to what you have
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
before you today all stakeholders have
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
signed off on the bill
 
03:47:47.590 --> 03:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
we refined the definition to be very
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
specific we put in place metrics for the
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
implementation as well as a waiver
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
process and we made sure that compliance
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
and accountability also had some teeth
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
using standard language from the
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration for
 
03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
similar processes
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh it was further amended as you're
 
03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
probably aware by
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
by the house in a way that
 
03:48:11.189 --> 03:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
made it even better
 
03:48:12.550 --> 03:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
while allowing for appropriate
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
exemptions the bill
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
requires the state to reinvest taxpayer
 
03:48:19.750 --> 03:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
dollars in our own local regional and
 
03:48:21.750 --> 03:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
statewide economies
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll support the bill and thank
 
03:48:25.990 --> 03:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
you i'm happy to take any questions
 
03:48:28.469 --> 03:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
03:48:28.479 --> 03:48:29.269 align:start position:0%
have any questions
yes

03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative schultz hi senator hi
 
03:48:31.680 --> 03:48:32.469 align:start position:0%
representative schultz hi senator hi
um

03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
just a quick question i love uh this
 
03:48:37.590 --> 03:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
concept of this bill
 
03:48:39.670 --> 03:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
and uh giving the
 
03:48:42.389 --> 03:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
preferential option on american
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
materials was there ever any thought of
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
also including american unionized labor
 
03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:50.710 align:start position:0%
also including american unionized labor
um

03:48:50.710 --> 03:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
right now it actually this is
 
03:48:53.439 --> 03:48:54.830 align:start position:0%
right now it actually this is
supported

03:48:54.830 --> 03:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
supported
 
03:48:57.670 --> 03:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
in every state including texas where
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's been introduced by the unions
 
03:49:00.080 --> 03:49:01.269 align:start position:0%
it's been introduced by the unions
because

03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:49:01.279 --> 03:49:02.469 align:start position:0%
because
again

03:49:02.469 --> 03:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
this is not just about
 
03:49:06.070 --> 03:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
using steel
 
03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
in american jobs american steel and
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
american jobs but the steel that the
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
fabricators use is from america as well
 
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
so many of the jobs that it's supporting
 
03:49:18.389 --> 03:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
is supporting union labor so it's not a
 
03:49:22.870 --> 03:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
union bill per se but the unions
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
were part of the group that actually
 
03:49:26.309 --> 03:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
brought it to my attention so they are
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.110 --> 03:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
senator can we get a copy of your
 
03:49:35.189 --> 03:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
testimony to share the file thank you
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i can give you this one
 
03:49:39.750 --> 03:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
i would just like to make a comment we
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
used to have and roberts aware of them
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
isaac's instructor steele which is the
 
03:49:46.950 --> 03:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
same industries that sees
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
that closed for different reasons and i
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
won't go into the reasons but
 
03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
after that close the dealership
 
03:49:57.910 --> 03:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
dropped 21 vehicles per year
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
that used to go to isaacson structured
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
steel and were never gained back whether
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
the employees were dispersed throughout
 
03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
the state but that's just one little
 
03:50:07.520 --> 03:50:08.550 align:start position:0%
the state but that's just one little
tidbit

03:50:08.550 --> 03:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
tidbit
 
03:50:11.349 --> 03:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
of economic loss
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
um with that one closure of a place that
 
03:50:16.710 --> 03:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
i suspect is very similar
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
to what we're talking about here so
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
this is real stuff
 
03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately where i live we can
 
03:50:24.630 --> 03:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
speak to a lot of things like this but
 
03:50:26.309 --> 03:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i just would like to bring
 
03:50:28.469 --> 03:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
that out thank you thank you
 
03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else like to
 
03:50:42.150 --> 03:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you members
 
03:50:43.680 --> 03:50:44.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you members
of

03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:50:46.150 --> 03:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
house finance i was involved in the
 
03:50:49.030 --> 03:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
house amendment that removed the 25
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
threshold that was originally in the
 
03:50:51.120 --> 03:50:52.389 align:start position:0%
threshold that was originally in the
bill

03:50:52.389 --> 03:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
i want to tackle a couple of things
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
the reason that the house did
 
03:50:58.870 --> 03:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
edna remove that is because there was
 
03:51:04.229 --> 03:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:06.070 --> 03:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
a a
 
03:51:09.189 --> 03:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
range if you will to have criteria there
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
was concern that that would just cause
 
03:51:11.040 --> 03:51:11.750 align:start position:0%
was concern that that would just cause
the

03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
bidders to have an open window to
 
03:51:13.359 --> 03:51:14.550 align:start position:0%
bidders to have an open window to
inflate

03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
inflate
 
03:51:16.070 --> 03:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily agree with that but
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
we took it out
 
03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't exist
 
03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i want to talk
 
03:51:21.670 --> 03:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
about in reference to this in my
 
03:51:24.150 --> 03:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
concerns references back to some of the
 
03:51:25.910 --> 03:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
things we've seen in the last four years
 
03:51:26.870 --> 03:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
some of the things the former
 
03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
president's been concerned of and that
 
03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
is critical type of
 
03:51:34.389 --> 03:51:34.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that the united states
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
used to lead the world in
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
has is either dried up it's drying up or
 
03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's frankly being shipped overseas
 
03:51:45.670 --> 03:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
the bentley chevrolet in my district
 
03:51:48.150 --> 03:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
has 15 new cars
 
03:51:48.160 --> 03:51:49.189 align:start position:0%
has 15 new cars
period

03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:51:51.670 --> 03:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
in this dealership because they rely
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
on a product that came from overseas and
 
03:51:55.510 --> 03:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
what that ultimately is doing not only
 
03:52:00.389 --> 03:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
to to the supply chain of certain things
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
but the generalized economy in the
 
03:52:03.750 --> 03:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
united states
 
03:52:05.750 --> 03:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
we've we've lost two steel fabricators
 
03:52:07.510 --> 03:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire already
 
03:52:09.990 --> 03:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have a handful left
 
03:52:12.870 --> 03:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see another industry
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
that is critical to the operations of
 
03:52:17.830 --> 03:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
this state go away
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm concerned
 
03:52:22.309 --> 03:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
about based on some of the two speeches
 
03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
that were given
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the house
 
03:52:29.349 --> 03:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
that were grossly incorrect one of them
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
involved restricting this bill
 
03:52:34.469 --> 03:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
in a way that only four people can bid
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
on that that's that is totally not true
 
03:52:37.750 --> 03:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's not in the bill
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
the steel fabricators will still have to
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
bid for the jobs it is not restricted to
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire only so you're going to
 
03:52:45.429 --> 03:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
have competitors in massachusetts in
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
maine and the regional area will still
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
have the right to bid
 
03:52:52.710 --> 03:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
and the safeguards that are involved
 
03:52:56.150 --> 03:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't require that the state procurement
 
03:52:58.229 --> 03:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
attend to any of them i sit on the state
 
03:53:00.309 --> 03:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
procurement commission right now the
 
03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
chairman of the state procurement
 
03:53:03.750 --> 03:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
commission senator carson is a
 
03:53:05.910 --> 03:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill
 
03:53:08.469 --> 03:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
i've looked this over from the
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
in those eyes if you will my procurement
 
03:53:10.479 --> 03:53:11.590 align:start position:0%
in those eyes if you will my procurement
glasses

03:53:11.590 --> 03:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
glasses
 
03:53:13.269 --> 03:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
and there's enough
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
carve outs in this that it doesn't bind
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
the state to anything
 
03:53:17.120 --> 03:53:17.830 align:start position:0%
the state to anything
if

03:53:17.830 --> 03:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:53:19.510 --> 03:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
the folks in the room the folks out
 
03:53:21.189 --> 03:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
there that do this type of work if they
 
03:53:24.550 --> 03:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
come in with bids that the state feels
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
are are
 
03:53:28.550 --> 03:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
not in line with say some of the foreign
 
03:53:30.150 --> 03:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
entities the state has the right to
 
03:53:33.189 --> 03:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
reject them and cost is a is a listed
 
03:53:33.199 --> 03:53:34.550 align:start position:0%
reject them and cost is a is a listed
factor

03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
factor
 
03:53:36.389 --> 03:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
so this does not lock the state of new
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire into
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
a limited window of a limited group
 
03:53:43.990 --> 03:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's bidding
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
in a situation where they all know each
 
03:53:47.830 --> 03:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
other that doesn't exist here
 
03:53:50.469 --> 03:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
so this still retains a competitive
 
03:53:50.479 --> 03:53:53.590 align:start position:0%
so this still retains a competitive
marketplace

03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it still allows the state and out
 
03:53:56.640 --> 03:53:58.710 align:start position:0%
and it still allows the state and out
overall

03:53:58.710 --> 03:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
overall
 
03:54:01.189 --> 03:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
personally i think
 
03:54:01.199 --> 03:54:02.229 align:start position:0%
personally i think
that

03:54:02.229 --> 03:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
we have gone on too long
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
relying on foreign markets for
 
03:54:06.239 --> 03:54:07.269 align:start position:0%
relying on foreign markets for
everything

03:54:07.269 --> 03:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:54:07.279 --> 03:54:08.309 align:start position:0%
everything
and

03:54:08.309 --> 03:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
that needs to cease we have got to
 
03:54:10.800 --> 03:54:12.229 align:start position:0%
that needs to cease we have got to
retain

03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
retain
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
what this what the united states
 
03:54:16.229 --> 03:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
is really was really known for in the
 
03:54:16.239 --> 03:54:17.110 align:start position:0%
is really was really known for in the
world

03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
world
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
and steel is definitely one of those
 
03:54:18.800 --> 03:54:20.630 align:start position:0%
and steel is definitely one of those
things

03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
we also heard testimony or at least a
 
03:54:23.670 --> 03:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
speech on the floor of the house
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
concerning supply chains and i had to
 
03:54:26.950 --> 03:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
laugh when they
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
when the speaker referenced the fact
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
that a supply chain from china
 
03:54:33.189 --> 03:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
in essence would be
 
03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
better than a supply chain internally
 
03:54:37.269 --> 03:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
that's insane
 
03:54:41.349 --> 03:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
we've seen huge problems with overseas
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
shipping and huge problems with people
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
getting stuff to coming in from from the
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
asian markets
 
03:54:48.870 --> 03:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know where he he got came up
 
03:54:51.429 --> 03:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
with that idea but domestic steel is
 
03:54:51.439 --> 03:54:52.550 align:start position:0%
with that idea but domestic steel is
here

03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
i don't need to worry about a ship
 
03:54:56.150 --> 03:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
sitting off the port of long beach
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
right so
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is a matter of allowing the these
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
folks to
 
03:55:05.590 --> 03:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
to basically get into a level playing
 
03:55:07.990 --> 03:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
field now i've had the fortune and i
 
03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
won't i won't mention the company but
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
i've had the fortune of touring one of
 
03:55:15.269 --> 03:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
these facilities recently to get an idea
 
03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
and all i saw was hard work and fellas
 
03:55:17.359 --> 03:55:18.389 align:start position:0%
and all i saw was hard work and fellas
in

03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
by the way a non-union shop so this this
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
is not about unions at all it's got
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with unions frankly this
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
is just about
 
03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire jobs new hampshire
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
businesses new hampshire economy getting
 
03:55:32.790 --> 03:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
their fair
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
and that's what it's about that's why
 
03:55:37.910 --> 03:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm in favor of it that's why
 
03:55:39.269 --> 03:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
i spoke out on the floor of the house
 
03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
and i'll continue to support it
 
03:55:42.950 --> 03:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i just asked the finance committee
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
to think about this as you would in
 
03:55:46.950 --> 03:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
financial terms if the state of new
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire is not locked into this and
 
03:55:51.030 --> 03:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
cost can be a factor for rejection
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
questions

03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:55:59.670 --> 03:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
yes represented
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
i have a question and it may be a better
 
03:56:04.150 --> 03:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
question for one of the fabricators but
 
03:56:05.830 --> 03:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
while the
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
tariffs were in effect on canadian steel
 
03:56:11.910 --> 03:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
did that affect what was going on with
 
03:56:14.070 --> 03:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
the contracts here and did it affect the
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
market here in the states i can't speak
 
03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
to that but i'll tell you this when the
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
federal government puts a tariff in they
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
do it for a reason right because
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
they recognize there's a there's an
 
03:56:24.870 --> 03:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
unfair advantage that's what a tariff
 
03:56:24.880 --> 03:56:26.469 align:start position:0%
unfair advantage that's what a tariff
does

03:56:26.469 --> 03:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:56:28.150 --> 03:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
as i said on the floor of the house when
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
they literally can drill a hole
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
in steel and then say well it's
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
processed it's it's literally a loophole
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
all jokes aside they literally just
 
03:56:39.510 --> 03:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
drill a damn hole in the steel
 
03:56:39.520 --> 03:56:41.189 align:start position:0%
drill a damn hole in the steel
so

03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:56:41.199 --> 03:56:43.429 align:start position:0%
so
clearly

03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
the foreign markets are going to do
 
03:56:46.870 --> 03:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
everything they can to try to get around
 
03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
the tariffs that the united states has
 
03:56:49.269 --> 03:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
put on
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
foreign steel so does that affect their
 
03:56:53.429 --> 03:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
world i i can guarantee it to what
 
03:56:54.790 --> 03:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
extent they could tell you better than i
 
03:56:54.800 --> 03:56:58.950 align:start position:0%
extent they could tell you better than i
could

03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:58.960 --> 03:57:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
please

03:57:01.590 --> 03:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
i can see you
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
so i believe you're talking about the
 
03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
tariffs 232 that went in about raw
 
03:57:10.000 --> 03:57:11.189 align:start position:0%
tariffs 232 that went in about raw
material

03:57:11.189 --> 03:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
material
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't against uh canada canada
 
03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
as actually doesn't have any steel mills
 
03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
they have to buy their raw material
 
03:57:19.120 --> 03:57:20.710 align:start position:0%
they have to buy their raw material
outside

03:57:20.710 --> 03:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
outside
 
03:57:22.150 --> 03:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
they either buy it from us they buy it
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
from china they can buy it from
 
03:57:23.920 --> 03:57:25.189 align:start position:0%
from china they can buy it from
europe

03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
europe
 
03:57:25.199 --> 03:57:26.070 align:start position:0%
europe
so

03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
they were able to as as representative
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
pearson was saying they buy foreign
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
steel themselves they fabricate it
 
03:57:32.800 --> 03:57:33.670 align:start position:0%
steel themselves they fabricate it
it

03:57:33.670 --> 03:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
it circumvents terrace because the
 
03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
i was just sitting here googling and
 
03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
under our former president there were
 
03:57:46.710 --> 03:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
tariffs that went in against canadian
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
steel and aluminum it was a joint tariff
 
03:57:50.150 --> 03:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
that went in
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
that made me think it might have
 
03:57:53.830 --> 03:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
affected your industry and raw material
 
03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
so they do produce um tube but not
 
03:58:00.309 --> 03:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
structural steel thank you
 
03:58:03.990 --> 03:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to follow a rock star
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
like that when it comes to the steel
 
03:58:09.750 --> 03:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
fabrication industry in new hampshire so
 
03:58:12.309 --> 03:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just gonna end what uh
 
03:58:14.070 --> 03:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
my point here but that that's that's my
 
03:58:15.510 --> 03:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
concern with finance is that you guys
 
03:58:16.950 --> 03:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
just look at the the financial
 
03:58:18.710 --> 03:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
implications and risks as i did as a
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
member of the state procurement
 
03:58:21.590 --> 03:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
commission and just see
 
03:58:23.990 --> 03:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully what what i see so thank you
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:32.070 --> 03:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's curious to me that this is another
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
bill that has no money in it
 
03:58:36.630 --> 03:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
and here we are in finance
 
03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
charged with
 
03:58:39.910 --> 03:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility but there isn't
 
03:58:39.920 --> 03:58:40.950 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility but there isn't
any

03:58:40.950 --> 03:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:58:49.750 --> 03:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
