executive session I will open up with
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
429 relative to the color of executive
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
Council official cover
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
Hill motion is ought to pass is there a
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative foot
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
you care to speak to your
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
motion as far as I'm
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
concerned as far as I'm concerned the
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
executive councel um can have any color
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
plate they want
 
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
um and that's
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
it and so you know they actually have
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
had their own color plates for quite
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
some time uh we don't know how it
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
occurred it was being done outside of
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
Statute so this basically brings them
 
00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
back back to their blue plates that
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
they've had for so long um anybody else
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I'll ask the clerk

a
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative Rich
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
here to speak to your
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
motion um yes I just believe that um
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
this will put into statue what we assume
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
everybody does anyway and may not which
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
is um if practical give a wide birth
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
without endangering oncoming
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
traffic and uh maintain a slow
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.549 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
Hill I maybe the only no vote on this um
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
I uh I think it causes more problems
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
than it solves I um I Envision I've seen
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
enough people on the highway
 
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.510 align:start position:0%
enough people on the highway
um

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
see uh a lighted vehicle and go shooting
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
over without looking to see who's next
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
to them that I can only imagine um the
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
same situation happen if there's an
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
abandoned vehicle on the side of the
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
road and they will come shooting over um
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
regardless is thinking that that's the
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
law so I'm not a fan um and I'll be
 
00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.270 align:start position:0%
law so I'm not a fan um and I'll be
voting

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
voting
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
now anybody
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
else represent C the only thing I noted
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
on this bill and it can be fixed in uh
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
when the bill is enrolled it's on line
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
nine between emergency and warning there
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
does not need to be a comma
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
there that is the type of thing that can
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
get fixed once it's enrolled anybody
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
else seeing then I I represent
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
Smith yeah just a question for everybody
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
to think about before they vote um that
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
this adds some pretty big impact new
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
language to the existing statute the the
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
current language is give a wide birth
 
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
without endangering blah blah blah and
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
this says if
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
practical who determines the
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
practicality what's the penalty and how
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
will that work at the court hearing and
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
anybody else and I agree I'm leaning
 
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
towards a no on this um I get it but
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
even during our public hearings we heard
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
that enforceability is going to be a
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
problem and if we're going to pass a l
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it do something um
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative Hill I think his his um
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
his point is is valid uh being a
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist I consider that as well I
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to be to the left of somebody
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
and have somebody panic and Shoot To the
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
Left to make sure the around somebody
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
who's in the breakdown Lane
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
thirdly if you've got the wherewithal to
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
make the maneuver to
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
yield that means you already spotted the
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
person in the breakdown Lane so the
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
chances of hitting them are probably
 
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
pretty slim you've already spotted them
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
I just don't see the need for this and I
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't see what it accomplishes so I'm
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
leaning towards the no side anybody else
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
rep the of s
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
clear I I just try I watch people all
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
the time um the chair and uh it seems
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
like most people already kind of do that
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
move and and uh I agree I I think there
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
are some people like they do with
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles they just freak out
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
and and just
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
overreact and and that that is a
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
worrisome situation thank you yeah and
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
again that's my point I mean a lot of
 
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
people do it most people with courtesy
 
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
and Common Sense are going to continue
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
to do it why do we need it instead
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
statute that's if it's not enforcable so
 
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.790 align:start position:0%
statute that's if it's not enforcable so
anybody

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
else represent SES so from my point of
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
view that one of the uh prime directive
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
for this committee is to look out for
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and the numbers of persons
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
who are killed or injured of the
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
motoring public who have pulled over as
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
far as they felt safe and comfortable to
 
00:48:26.589 --> 00:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
do um is a staggering number um you know
 
00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:27.990 align:start position:0%
do um is a staggering number um you know
it's

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
it it varies of course year to year I
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
think this is a good Public Safety
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
message um uh bill and I would and it
 
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
was supported by uh the New Hampshire
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
dot um the New Hampshire State Police
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
who watched traffic patterns and and the
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
way people uh Drive quite carefully I'm
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
sure and um the aaa's also had written
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
testimony in favor as did the prime
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor so for that reason and many more
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
I would be voting in favor of this
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
spell anybody
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
else representative Koker yeah I wasn't
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
going to speak on this one but you know
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
I think what the chairman said about
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is if people see these these people
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to move over or they're
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
not going to hit them and I think that
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
what I my concern with this bill is it
 
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
might give kind of a false it's kind of
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
safety theater it it's it's doing
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
something that really isn't attacking
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
the root cause of the problem which I
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
think is you know maybe we should be
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
focused more on like the visibility of
 
00:49:31.549 --> 00:49:31.559 align:start position:0%
if you're on the side of the road you
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
know I mean get make yourself visible
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
you know like maybe we should start
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
really attacking that problem versus
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
just kind of attacking a problem that
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
seems to be the norm
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
of the average motorist so I think um
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna be a no vote on this
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
one anybody else represent a in Clair
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
last time thank you Mr chair I think
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
that um a lot of these accidents where
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
people do plowing the people on the side
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the road the law is not going to make
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
a difference they just didn't see them
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
because they weren't paying attention or
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps the the vehicles that are off
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
the side of the road either weren't off

motion of interim study
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
if there's that this many questions it
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
would be an appropriate thing to do all
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
right motion of inter room study
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
seconded by y
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
um I never would have expected this when
 
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
I woke up this morning but so be it um
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
care to speak to your
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
motion yeah I I think the very nature of
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
our vote which was 1010 which was
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan there was it literally the
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
committee was split on what was the
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
right thing to do for the first motion I
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
suspect that there'll be split on the
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
SEC any subsequent motion what I'm
 
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:32.799 align:start position:0%
hoping for is that we can at least have
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
a majority to accept that there are
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
legitimate questions that should be
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
answered and why not take the time to
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
try and do that our one option to do
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
study I'll agree with our ranking member
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
I think we had some good arguments on
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
both sides of this so I'll be fine with
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
the interim study anybody else from the
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
with my mic off so we did have a
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
question and I know we have somebody
 
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:17.559 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State's office
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
here can
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
you resmar eyesee what your questions
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
might have been
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
on on the language I believe it was on
 
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.630 align:start position:0%
on on the language I believe it was on
page

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.990 align:start position:0%
 
two

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.589 --> 01:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
um I can maybe jump in if you want what
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 581 581 I want I just wanted to be
 
01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm on the right Bel okay so
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
on 581 page
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
two um there's a
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
provision uh starting on I believe it's
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
line 28
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
it says applicants whose online renewal
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
application is approved shall receive a
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
temporary proof of license which shall
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
constitute the applicant's valid driver
 
01:01:11.549 --> 01:01:11.559 align:start position:0%
license until division issues a physical
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
driver license to the applicant or the
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have somebody from the
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office here to
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
answer that question it's a good
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
question so how do they going to know
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
that a temporary license is not
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh my name is
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
Aon hen Hennessy I am the deputy
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state I was summoned here
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
via email I didn't know what your
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
questions were going to be so I
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
apologize for not being prepared I'm
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
happy to get you answers to that we do a
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
lot of training in the Secretary of
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
State's office um I believe right now
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
there may already be some of that
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
language in current law that ISS not
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
valid for voting purposes and the reason
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
is is that a driver's license doesn't
 
01:02:59.549 --> 01:02:59.559 align:start position:0%
constitute proof of US citizenship even
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
the um even the the new one the real ID
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry transportation is not my
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse um does that answer your
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
question we we do a lot of training with
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
this it perplex your answer actually
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
perplexes me even more because I I see
 
01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.309 align:start position:0%
perplexes me even more because I I see
that

01:03:27.309 --> 01:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
on Election Day you walk into a room
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
they want to see your driver's
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
license I renewed my driver's license
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
and I had a paper driver's license at
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
one time showed them that they handed me
 
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
my ballots and off I
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
went so it concerns me that these
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers may not be as well trained as
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist would
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
be trained because all they are is
 
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
people who sit at a desk check your name
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
off hand you the ballots and have a nice
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
day that's my
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
concern so you're talk thank you for the
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
question so you're concerned that the
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
ballot clerks who are not elected
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
officials who are appointed would not
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
understand so to in order to get a
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
ballot from them you already have to be
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
on the checklist so what they're looking
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
for is your just to identify that you
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
are follow up y thank you so if I go in
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't have proof of residency I
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
can go in a room and I can fill out a
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
piece of paper that says that I'm
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
legally able to vote and take both of
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
both my temporary license and that piece
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
of paper and nobody's really knowing the
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
because ethical people would never do
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
thing but we're not always dealing with
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
concern thank you I didn't hear much of
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
a question there on the last one but so
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
my question is how do we prevent that
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
from happening with people who are not
 
01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily trained as well as
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist and they're
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
just clerks how do we prevent
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question so I'm
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
not sure if this is the answer you're
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
looking for but there are there's two
 
01:05:38.269 --> 01:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
different processes one the registration
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
process where you can use affidavits or
 
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
actual document proof for your residency
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
your age your identity and your
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
citizenship if you are already on the
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
checklist then you need to just show
 
01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
proof of ID to get your Ballot or an
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
election official can identify you as
 
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
being who you say you are if they know
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
you or you can use an affidavit to say
 
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
who you are well that raises the
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
question for me and I think that's maybe
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
where we're getting we all know we go
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
into to vote I give my driver's license
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
to the clerk she goes down the checklist
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'm in the W's and I get my ballot and
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
off I go this says what if I had what if
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
I what if I was able to temporary
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
license can I still do the same process
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
with the clerk with my temporary license
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
happen can you point me to the language
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
you're looking at specifically anybody
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the bill they can share
 
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.269 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the bill they can share
with

01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
her and we're looking on page two lines
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
actually pleas reading go ahead
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
y are you are you asking the the
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
checklist versus registering to vote is
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
that what no I'm I'm asking is that what
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
you're asking the bill States the way
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
it's written that a temporary
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
license is
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
not um sufficient proof for voting
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
purposes so a temporary license as we
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
learned at the last hearing is nothing
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
more than a copy of your new one but you
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
just haven't got your real card yet and
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just questioning the fact that
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
because it's temporary and it says in
 
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
this bill that you can't use it for
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
voting purposes what is the next step so
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
you you can't use it to identify
 
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
yourself because you can't you can't
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
register with it because you need more
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
documents than then Ser driver's license
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
your I'm asking you is so it's the way
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
it reads is that I can't use this to
 
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
identify myself to say who I am for the
 
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
so the way the way so I apologize this
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
was not on my radar of bills that I was
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be looking out for
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
um the way I read it is and I'm not a
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer is that you would not be able to
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
check in to get your ballot if you had a
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
temporary driver's license however
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
there is another law that says that you
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
can use an expired driver's
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
license and there's there's a law around
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
the and I I
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
apologize if if I I would have done
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
brought all the laws um with the with
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
the exceptions um and how long it can be
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
um expired for um but I do see the issue
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
with the language here and and maybe
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
it's to register to vote I'm not sure
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
what the intention of that language was
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative C and thank you very much
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
we I know we're throwing you to the
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
Wolves all right thank you Mr chairman
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh secretary for taking the
 
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
question I see two issues here one is if
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
you're just coming into the state and
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
getting a new license you've gone to the
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
registry you've turned in your old
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
license and they give you a little piece
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
of paper that you can fold the other one
 
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
is which I've just done because my
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
license expires in May is I went online
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
I still have my old license but they
 
01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
gave me a thing to print
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
out uh that I can carry with me that
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
lets if the state please call pull me
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
over it lets them know that I've applied
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
for the thing and haven't gotten it in
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
the mail um so I I see that
 
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
as uh and what you just pointed out is
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
my old license is good enough for
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
expired there are there are limitations
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
on the time frame for it I believe but I
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
have to I have to get all the election
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
law is very complicated
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
followup yeah go ahead follow up um just
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
as a followup is this something that
 
01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
should have been included in the
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
election law sections rather than just
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the driver's license sections thank
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
you for the question I think I think
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
that would be a great idea to include it
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
in the election law section
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
um because then it would have gone to
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
election law for voting purpose for for
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
the um discussion on this because they
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
are they have the background in this not
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
saying that you guys don't have the
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
background in this since you are elected
 
01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.709 align:start position:0%
background in this since you are elected
but

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
um I know that you want to EXA this
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
today I'm happy to get some more
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
questions answered from my legal staff
 
01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
if you're would like that um I think the
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
reason why I didn't know about this is
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
because it came to transportation and
 
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
not to election law in either of
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
the well we are the driver's license
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
specialist right I
 
01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.149 align:start position:0%
specialist right I
[Laughter]

01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
S I don't actually thank you uh Senator
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
Hennessy I appreciate you being here
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
today um I don't actually have a
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
question for you but I have a question
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
for the chair
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
um part of the problem that I'm
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
struggling with is that the purpose of
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is to get people who come in
 
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
and getting their driver's license they
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
can't get the actual PL I'll call it the
 
01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
plastic one that we normally have to
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
give them something to drive in case
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
they get stopped that's the
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
purpose and I worry that we are um
 
01:11:58.990 --> 01:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
conflating some issues towards other
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
matters that don't more properly belong
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
before another committee and I wonder my
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
question to you Mr chair is if you can
 
01:12:09.149 --> 01:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
recess this until the Secretary of
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
State's office has an opportunity to to
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
weigh in on this a little bit
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
more that's where I was headed
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
representative 6 as we do as I stated
 
01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
earlier are coming back next Tuesday uh
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
so I will recess this and and reschedule
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
it for that
 
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
date any other questions for
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
now Jack uh thank you Mr chairman uh one
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
of the things I don't remember from last
 
01:12:33.629 --> 01:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
if I go in in person what I don't
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
remember is if they take the plastic
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
license and give you the paper or if you
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
get to keep both and if you get to keep
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
both then you still have the plastic
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
license you could use for this expired
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
license potentially it could expire
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
before you get the new one then you
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
still have the plastic license you could
 
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
use uh for the checklist but it would be
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
good to get that answer uh the answer is
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
you do get your old one back when it's
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
expired actually usually wrap the new
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
one around it um but that's where we're
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
at in this
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
bill even according to the secretary of
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
state that the expired ones are not oh
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
no you can use them according to what
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
she stated but then then Roman 4A says
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
that you can even with having the
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
expired one so let's get we we're going
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
to come back one more time let's get
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
some of these answer questions answered
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%

license when they fold the paper one
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
around it they cut the corner of the
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
expired one so there is a way of knowing
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%

that are Leasing
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
um or operating on behalf of the
 
01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
Department of uh Transportation so again
 
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a private entity um these
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
pack and rides uh in recent Years or or
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
even have had a lot of crime Smash and
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%

of our society now and again to
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
brother syndrome so I would recommend uh

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.390 align:start position:0%
chair thank you sir anybody else from
the

01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
um they aren't privately owned um these
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
are these are still State own properties
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
I believe um that are proper and and the
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
private entity is leasing the property
 
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
from from the state um for me there's
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
still questions um I know when the state
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
owns property there are limitations on
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that uh surveillance
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
tapes can be used Allah um
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk rule um and most
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
people are nodding that no
 
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk um I'm not
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
sure and I don't believe this if this
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
passes that those uh time limits for the
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
storage of these surveillance tapes
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
applies and that leads to me another
 
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
question of whether uh those storage
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
tapes would then be available as kind of
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
an end around around the Restriction
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
that we have on government property and
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
the and the limitations on those um
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
storage tapes so I um for that reason
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
and I will not support the
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
um to what we had for a discussion in
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
our prior meeting uh this is for nine
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
facilities and that the stored materials
 
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
are held for 24 days um I work at
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County Superior South we have
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
cameras everywhere and you see a lot of
 
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
State facilities there's cameras outside
 
01:19:29.709 --> 01:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
of all of our buildings here in conquer
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
this is not uh an unknown issue of
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
surveillance to try to capture evidence
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
of uh violations be it personal or
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
property uh and obviously our men and
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
women in blue can't be everywhere so
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we need the eyes of
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
surveillance so again I was just to my
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
note the uh stored materials are for 24
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
days is that's what came up in
 
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you repr st cair thank
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just you know these are
 
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
public facilities I don't know how much
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
privacy we need in a public facility I'm
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
on the public we're all on the
 
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
public hav't been uh victimized by crime
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
or know of other people or come upon a
 
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
scene where there's been a crime usually
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
the first thing people ask
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
cameras so we can see who did this and
 
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
have a chance at getting maybe some
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
justice there and I uh know that just in
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
the last weekend we had a bunch of uh
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
cars broken into with the uh Trail heads
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
that are public facilities that people
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
want to feel safe leaving their vehicles
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
there when they hike up a trail or visit
 
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
the park or whatever this is
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
um 24 days or a year I don't care you're
 
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
in public you're in public it's not in
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
my driveway where I probably expect a
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
privacy it's in a public facility and
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's what these cameras do is they add
 
01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
a a little bit of a level of hopefully
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
protection from deterring somebody to
 
01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
break in or at least make them put a
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
hood on or something like that but it
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
gives it gives us it gives law
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement and it gives us as Citizens
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
a chance to maybe get back a little bit
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
you um representative Gorski I just want
 
01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
to mention to the committee members too
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we do have somebody from the dot
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
that came here specifically to answer
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
any questions we may have on this bill
 
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
just to let you know representative
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr chairman um you know
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
I came today's session I actually flew
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
out of Nashville this this
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
morning and I did do a parking ride down
 
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.030 align:start position:0%
morning and I did do a parking ride down
in

01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and when I drove my car up
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
I could see that there There Was You
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
Know camera surveillance there which
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
made me feel a little bit more
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable leaving my car there for an
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
extended period of time I share
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative Hill's concerns however I
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
think having some type of surveillance I
 
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
think helps our constituency so I'm
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
cro I Le some Market in nsha and um in
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
it there are seven
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
cameras um it isn't my property I lease
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
it but I had to turn it over to the
 
01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
police when I saw a crime against a
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
child that was ad adjudicated on
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
Thursday when we were in General Session
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
they pled out and that crime has you
 
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
know been rewarded basically with
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
Justice it was a camera I put them there
 
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
in every single room it says cameras are
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
here because I'm trying to prevent
 
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:55.719 align:start position:0%
people from doing things I'm trying to
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
prevent theft from my employees I'm
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
trying to record if somebody got hurt
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
but I turned it over to the police and I
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
only keep that stuff for 24 hours not 24
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
days so I'm just saying I felt like I
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
had a right to protect my property that
 
01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.990 align:start position:0%
had a right to protect my property that
I'm

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
leasing represent Jack uh thank you Mr
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I just point out to the
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh the end of line six it says
 
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
that these cameras are not limited to
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
the surveillance parameters that were
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
negotiated with representative Kirk as
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
to where the images would go how long
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
they were kept just so everyone is clear
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh there would be as I read this there
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
would be no limitation on how long the
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
the video could be kept or who it could
 
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
be given to just so everyone is is clear
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
vote represent
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair um I'm not sure
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
that we debating the bill the the bill
 
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
is not about whether or not surveillance
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
is good or bad or if we should have it
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
or not um this is so the idea of us
 
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
being resistant to having it in the
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
first place is rooted in the drive
 
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:11.639 align:start position:0%
Privacy Act which is the most fiercely
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
guarded and protected bipartisan
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
legislation ever passed by the New
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house the original sponsors
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
were Senator Peter Burling from
 
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
Claremont representative Neil Kirk and
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
representative Susan Aly
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
since that happened we moved on to also
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that the government couldn't
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
spy on you in other ways and we had a
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill what eight years ago about the New
 
01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
London rest area the issue there wasn't
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not Highway the surveillance
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
of the rest area was good or bad but
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
right now dot is the only one allowed to
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
view the
 
01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
feeds this would change that the debate
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
then was whether or not the New London
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
Police Department could view the feeds
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
that failed um because people were
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the current system this
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill is about private legal entities who
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
are not government agents which is a
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
huge distinction in many things that we
 
01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
do being the ones to run this and have
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
access to it so what we should de be
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
debating is not whether or not we want
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
the surveillance but whether or not we
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
want private companies who we don't know
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know where they're from who
 
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
their people are to be the ones in in
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
charge of the video surveillance that
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
they will own it right they could record
 
01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
it this doesn't prohibit that so I'm not
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
advocating either way just let's make
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
sure that we're considering this bill
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
which is to give this access to unnamed
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
private legal entities at some point in
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
control thank you for that which was
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
leading me to my question I was going to
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
call in her but maybe you know the
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
answer why do we have a differentiation
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
any idea between what the state can do
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
with this data versus a private
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
entity thank you for the awkward
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
chair um so said we were moving away
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
from the bill get you back so right
 
01:26:13.159 --> 01:26:13.950 align:start position:0%
from the bill get you back so right
right

01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:17.719 align:start position:0%
now a good friend from where is looking
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
at the sky nervously wondering if
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
satellites are photographing his house
 
01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.149 align:start position:0%
satellites are photographing his house
um

01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
the idea that we can just set stuff up
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then do violations by remote control
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
was one fear that these surveillance
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
systems if networked properly could be
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
used to track somebody's progress and
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
they can it's done very effectively in
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
other states to run people down um
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
fleeing per I mean I'm okay with using
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
every tool we have to get some dirt bag
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
who kidnapped a child or something but
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
that is big policy that we should not
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
pass lightly so leaving it in the hands
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the government doing it keeps it
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
within your
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
control you give that up when you hire
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
private entities to do it because a
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
contract is going to be written and of
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know what's in the contract nope and
 
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
you never will probably so like that's
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
the place you have to have your head
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
when you decide if you're for or against
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
this and again I'm not advocating for or
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
against the bill I just want to make
 
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
sure that the actual question in the
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
bill which has nothing to do with
 
01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want surveillance or
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
not but the actual question do you want
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
private entities to have this resource
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
and power that that's the question you
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
vat anybody else from the committee
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair thank
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
you I'm at a storage facility up in
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
Guilford quite regularly they have
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
cameras everywhere I know they're
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
recording them I I pay to park some of
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
my vehicles there kind of a little bit
 
01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
like a park right I guess I don't care
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
that it's privately owned I don't think
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
any citizens care if it's privately
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
owned if they're getting some sense of
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
protection and I'm not doing anything
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
wrong if they want to look at me getting
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
in my car for the next two years it's
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
okay I just want some protection and I
 
01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
think this allowing these private
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
entities to do that I our constituents
 
01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
are not going to have a problem with
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.629 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
cabal I got the impression that there
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
was suggestions that people who had won
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
contract with the government to lease
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
the properties that they may be doing
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
the ferious things with these
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
cameras I would think they've been
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
scrutinized quite a bit before they won
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
that contract I don't think they're
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
going to take information and and abuse
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
it I don't remember hearing that said
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
but if you
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
have did you something more specific did
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
you are you saying that's what was said
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
or question it was suggested by
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative Smith that that we can't
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
trust these um private entities um these
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
are largely things like
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
ADT um or these um facilities that have
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
bid for the the right to lease the
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
properties they've gone through
 
01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.990 align:start position:0%
properties they've gone through
incredible

01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
incredible
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
scrutiny well I don't I'll let him
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
respond Pres
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
I would never say something like that in
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
committee what I did say was you don't
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
know what the terms of the contract are
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
and that is a fact you will not know
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
what the terms of the contract are just
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
like legislation you may like the
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
language you may object to the language
 
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
strongly you don't get that opportunity
 
01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
with the contract when you cast your
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
vote today that's all I'm saying and the
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
other thing I'm feeling like is we're
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
still on the debate of surveillance good
 
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
protects me want more of it
 
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
you know that's not happening with this
 
01:29:58.750 --> 01:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
bill there will be no more surveillance
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
than we have right now because if you
 
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
read the statute that this bill is
 
01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
amending where they can do this is
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
explicitly stated and I mean in detail I
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
93 exit 2 and sale on my 93 Exit 4 in
 
01:30:14.189 --> 01:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
London there there there's a list the
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
way to get more surveillance is to add
 
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
things to that list this bill is simply
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
saying do doesn't have to do it anymore
 
01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
we can hire outside contractors to do it
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
that is that is what the bill I'm sorry
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
if I'm sounding frustrated but that that
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
is the entire scope of the bill if you
 
01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:33.639 align:start position:0%
want to take the existing surveillance
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
no more not one more camera because
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
you're not voting on that today and say
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
dot doesn't have to do it anymore they
 
01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
can just hire some private contractors
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
to do it that is the bill and it isn't
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
that I don't trust them it's that I
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what those terms are going to
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
today all right I think we've had just
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
about enough fund with 469 but I'll give
 
01:30:58.510 --> 01:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
you one more stab at it representative
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
C okay thank you Mr chairman and this
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
question may be for the person from do
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
is are these particular facilities under
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
surveillance cameras now without this
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
bill briefly sure or just shake your
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
head yes or
 
01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.629 align:start position:0%
head yes or

oh what's that me yes they are being
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
done currently correct right and as it
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
was said these are already spelled out
 
01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
in a statute that this bill is
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
question only because you haven't said a
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
word all day I'll give you
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
one my question is for the the D

mind and uh thank you for taking the
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman thank you um well
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
hold on if she can introduce herself for
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%

legislation as
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
written the legislation as written is
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
very prescriptive in which ations that
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
would apply to that currently have fixed
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
route bus services with hundreds of
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%

whose contract will go through a
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
governor and counsel process as opposed
 
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:14.840 align:start position:0%

01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to open up the
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
582 relative to providing an alternate
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
address to the Department of Motor
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
Vehicles is there a
 
01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
motion representative Coker I'll make a
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
motion of a to pass a to pass is moved
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
is there a second second seconded by
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski care to speak to
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
your motion sir just makes sense um
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
people Snowbird going and out of the
 
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
state um having an alternate address
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Motor Vehicles
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
can help prevent some uh just lost mail
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
and make things a little bit convenient
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
for everybody so we should out to pass
 
01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.350 align:start position:0%
for everybody so we should out to pass
anybody

01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
else I think to me it made sense when I
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
when I realized or was uh reminded that
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
everything the Department of Motor
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
Vehicle sends out is do not forward so
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
if you happen to be gone for a while
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
you're not getting it and then the
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
search is on so this does make some
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
sense with no other comments I'll ask
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the role when she's
 
01:36:48.189 --> 01:36:48.199 align:start position:0%

01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right we'll take up Senate Bill
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
598 our most controversial bill of the
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
Year requiring funeral procession lead
 
01:38:19.589 --> 01:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
vehicles to obey yield signs so I have a
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
motion moved by representa pondon
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%

01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative by representative St
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
Clair care to speak to your motion sir
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes I actually drafted the original
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and with the house reps and
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
Senators on the uh uh original
 
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
legislation on funeral processions with
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
the size of the signage of flags the
 
01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
purple lights and all of that now
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
I that was probably
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
eight years ago 10 years ago and in that
 
01:38:59.470 --> 01:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
time frame I have not heard of any
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
issues although around the state I
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
understand like we onen there's a lot of
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
roundabouts but to my understanding the
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
lead vehicle has always followed the uh
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh the rule of of the road you know
 
01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
yielding and stop signs and then the
 
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
procession follows through uh if that
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
was admitted in the original legislation
 
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
then it got lost in the translation
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere but that this legisl
 
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh was fully intended when it was
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
originally drafted so I would recommend
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
a to pass just as a house cleaning
 
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
measure thank you anybody
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
