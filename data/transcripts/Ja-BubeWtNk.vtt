00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
question

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
more of a uh thank you very much because
 
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
I noticed that there was a savings from
 
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
refinancing through the treasury
 
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
Department of seven hundred thousand
 
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and I think it's important to
 
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
point that out that oftentimes these
 
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
kind of gloss over what you've the
 
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
positive things that have done with
 
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
refinancing but that caught my attention
 
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 align:start position:0%

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
item number 23 185.
 
00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
and I guess there's a couple of people
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
have questions on that
 
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you Mr chairman
 
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
um my question is really not exactly
 
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
related to this item but
 
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
um you would you had told us a couple
 
00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
months ago that Hampstead was out of
 
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
compliance with a contract they weren't
 
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.890 align:start position:0%
compliance with a contract they weren't
Staffing

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
Staffing
 
00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 align:start position:0%
to require levels so my question is are
 
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
they back in compliance and what is this
 
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.850 align:start position:0%
they back in compliance and what is this
census

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
right good afternoon
 
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
um for the record Marissa hen associate
 
00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
commissioner at DHHS and thanks Senator
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald for the question
 
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.130 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald for the question
um

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
so Staffing remains a challenge at
 
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampstead to the extent that not only
 
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
did we issue the letter of compliance
 
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
but we now have calls
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
um once a week with the leadership team
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's there as well as
 
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
um at least once a month with the
 
00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
executive leadership of well path
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
Recovery Solutions the the clinical
 
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
contractor to talk about Staffing in
 
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
fact we just had one yesterday where
 
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
they briefed me on all of their
 
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention strategies I
 
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
think what I can say
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
um so current today there are
 
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 33 youth um uh in the
 
00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
inpatient census
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and five in our prtf what has been
 
00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
positive has been the fact that we have
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
been able to build out the um the array
 
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
of services across the Continuum I spoke
 
00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
this morning with several of you at HHS
 
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
oversight about the importance of the
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
establishment of that prtf but we
 
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
continue to hold the contractor
 
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
um you know we continue to to closely
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
supervise their work to to recruit to
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
retain they're actually completing a
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
market analysis on salaries to ensure
 
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
that what they are offering is
 
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
um marketing Market competitive but we
 
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
want to see more of those beds open
 
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
um currently approximately 50 or 25 beds
 
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
could be open if we had more staff so I
 
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
think we're seeing the wait list lower
 
00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
we continue to be committed to getting
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
um getting it down to zero but in the
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
meantime it's a tough Staffing
 
00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.870 align:start position:0%
meantime it's a tough Staffing
environment

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
further question thank you quick
 
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up what steps
 
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
can the department take to ensure
 
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.129 align:start position:0%
can the department take to ensure
compliance

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
so that we get back at least to the
 
00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
level of kids that were in there when we
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
bought the place yeah well actually the
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
level of kids that are at the facility
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
now is um is pretty close to what it was
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
when we bought the facility it hasn't we
 
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
haven't fallen below that threshold and
 
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
in fact we have had weeks where
 
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
depending on the Acuity of the milieu we
 
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
do rise over 40. so so we have seen
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
things um certainly stable I would say
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
but I think it's really about enforcing
 
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
the contract about making sure that they
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
are doing all of the
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
um quantitative and qualitative analysis
 
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
that they're engaging the recruitment
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
resources not just that they have on
 
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
site at the facility but also that this
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
National company offers
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and really holding them to an
 
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.249 align:start position:0%
um and really holding them to an
expectation

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
um as well as pulling in uh all of their
 
00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 align:start position:0%
expertise to especially see if they can
 
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
lure people uh six miles over the border
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
to join us from Massachusetts I think
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
has been another key uh advantage that
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
they that Hampstead can sometimes offer
 
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
so we we're taking it very seriously and
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
at this same time we don't we want to
 
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're maintaining a safe
 
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
environment especially for the highly
 
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
we're going back out to bid on the
 
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
contract right are we hoping for other
 
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.249 align:start position:0%
contract right are we hoping for other
vendors

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
so the RFP was released
 
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
um just about two weeks ago we had a
 
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
vendor conference as well as tours and
 
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
we look forward to we hope to um to
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
attract a a variety of proposals and and
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
well path Recovery Solutions is invited
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
to submit a proposal as well
 
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
um and as anyone will see we we also did
 
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
a request for information an RFI to
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
ensure that stakeholders providers
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
community members were able to weigh in
 
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
on what they feel is most important
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
whether that is Staffing whether it's
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
aspects of the system of care whether
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
it's family orientation and Community
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
linkages so
 
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
um so yes this contract was always
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
designed as two years so that we could
 
00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 align:start position:0%
um enforce it closely provide critical
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
oversight and then make a decision on
 
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
further questions senator robertsell
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.570 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:18.890 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
um a prtf a psychiatric residential
 
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
treatment facility which is actually
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
separate from the inpatient hospital but
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
it is co-located so in essence it is it
 
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
does sort of appear as a new Wing even
 
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
though it's accredited and operated
 
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.010 align:start position:0%
though it's accredited and operated
separately

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
separately
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
um are you having trouble Staffing that
 
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
as well is that added into the numbers
 
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
that you're having trouble Staffing
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
um we certainly do have some positions
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
that we need to fill there but in part
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
because of the Innovative therapeutic
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
model that that offers that has
 
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
attracted certain staff who want to work
 
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
in that environment and we've also had
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
um we've basically just had an ability
 
00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
to attract based on people who are more
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
in the Residential Care world than they
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
are in in the hospital world so so we're
 
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
doing okay there but we definitely have
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
positions particularly
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
um some counselor and nursing positions
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to fill in order to
 
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
increase that census from the current of
 
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:12.419 align:start position:0%
about five or six up to a full capacity
 
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:17.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for for coming when we had
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
when we had the young people at New
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital we had how many
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
in Residence there was it about 40. it
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
was before my time so I'm looking to see
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
below 40 is what I'm I'm being told they
 
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
were moved in uh the move from New
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital to Hampstead was in
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh 2019. it would be moved would we move
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire hospital we moved all
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
of the children to the to hibson
 
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
hospital that's correct and what is the
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
what is the capacity of of hips Head
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hospital yeah so um we believe the
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
capacity is 70. if you look at the
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
official licensure it says 110 110 would
 
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
never be realistic and I think when
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
several of you visited we talked about
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
that um in theory if you filled every
 
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
bed and everyone had three roommates I
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
suppose you could get 110 patients in
 
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
there but that's not realistic given um
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
the evidence-based treatment guidelines
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
of today so 70 would be the max that we
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
conceive of right now one unit is closed
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
because of some Renovations that are
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
being completed some furniture that's
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
being moved in I think we pointed that
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
one out to you on the tour but um but 70
 
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
is what we are hoping to get to good for
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
the question what's our waiting list
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
today yeah
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the waiting list today is eight youth
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
um and um and then on the adult side it
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
is 17.
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
so 17 adults they're being taken care of
 
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
so those are 17 adults with
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
um ieas with involuntary you know
 
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
emergency admission
 
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
um paperwork who are awaiting a bed for
 
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.650 align:start position:0%
um paperwork who are awaiting a bed for
placement

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
placement
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
who are currently in emergency
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
this would further it reacted to the
 
00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
court order we have to get them out of
 
00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
the emergency departments ASAP correct
 
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah and the Departments
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
as I spoke at the last um fiscal I
 
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
believe um we are we're working on that
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
we're working on the mission zero effort
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
um so we're fully committed okay okay
 
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative leishman for a question
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question in the body of the
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
letter that we're looking at it said
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
that General funds may be requested if
 
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
other funds unavailable do you see the
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
likelihood of needing a further request
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
for General funds or right I'm going to
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
let our CFO Nathan white take that one
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Nathan white Chief
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer
 
00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:48.350 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer
um

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
the original budget for State fiscal
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
year 23 included the the arpa funds as
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
well as the the um the revenue that that
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
um the other funds in the state fiscal
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
year 2425 budget uh we do have a little
 
00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:05.339 align:start position:0%
over nine million dollars of General
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
funds currently budgeted so in in 24 and
 
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
25 we do potentially expect to utilize
 
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
General funds in addition to our in
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
addition to our patient revenues we
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
discussed this during the budget process
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
with division three members as well as
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
with Senate finance that right now we
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
are still building the history of what
 
00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:29.459 align:start position:0%
that what that Revenue mix looks like so
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's closer to 50 50 patient revenues to
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
General funds right now
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
um at Hampstead Hospital the patient
 
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:40.019 align:start position:0%
revenues are coming in higher than what
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
we had originally anticipated which I
 
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
think is good news
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
um the the big Wrinkle In This of course
 
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:48.500 align:start position:0%
is we are going back out to bid
 
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh for a contract to be effective next
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
July 2024 anytime you go back out to bid
 
00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
you do potentially face increased costs
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily know what that will
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
look like and how that will play out but
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
from my perspective on the financial
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
side I do just see that as something
 
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll keep an eye on as well as
 
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
for the 2627 budget and I know that
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like eons away but I'm sure it'll
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
be here before we know it we are going
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
to be keeping a close eye on what the
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
general fund need will look like for the
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
next biennium and right now it does
 
00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:21.350 align:start position:0%
next biennium and right now it does
appear

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
appear
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
right now that that that the mix could
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
be less General funds than we originally
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
anticipated for this biennium but we're
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
going to wait and see how that plays out
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
right now we don't even yet have a full
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
year of Revenue because we do have some
 
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
delays with the patient Revenue payments
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
that we do receive but that's something
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
that we're keeping a close eye on and
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
we'll provide more information on that
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
as we go forward
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:47.459 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards of our question
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir that's pretty simple for Mr
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
White I'm sure and that is uh this uh
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
item 185 is
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
opening up 150 000 to help pay for wages
 
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
that were higher than anticipated and
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
because we were able to hire people
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
faster than we thought okay so so that's
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
I guess that's fine news but what it
 
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
makes me curious about is in the next
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
budget has has this line item been
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
properly funded so that this is an
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
exception because of a startup issue or
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
on an ongoing basis is this budgeted
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
properly sure so the budget in the state
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 budget we put this
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
together uh the the former CFO and the
 
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Hospital CFO as well as
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
collaborate collaboration with the
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
existing Hampton Outlook staff at the
 
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
time they put together that budget the
 
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
current budget for 23 and they made
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
certain assumptions about what we would
 
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
hire the six executive team members at
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
the the six unclassified positions at
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
the time they were non-classified
 
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
and there were assumptions that it would
 
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
probably come where the positions would
 
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
be hired potentially in the range of
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
step three or four or five
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
um in order to compete with the private
 
00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
sector we did have to make a number of
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
offers that were higher than that and so
 
00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:11.459 align:start position:0%
for our budget the next go around those
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
have been budget accordingly at their
 
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
current salaries so I don't foresee an
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
issue here um we do have some positions
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
that are not at that Max stepper at that
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
higher step and if there's turnover and
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
we hire at a higher rate I mean we
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
certainly have that potential likelihood
 
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
or maybe not potential likelihood but we
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
have that potential scenario but long
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
story short uh yes we are all set for
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
just just made me realize I had a
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
question around that and that is
 
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.610 align:start position:0%
question around that and that is
um

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
are we are I I talked to you on the
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
phone a week ago and you you gave me a
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
very nice update on the status of our
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
payments to Hampstead and and at the
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
time there was a hang up on being able
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
to to make the next set of payments to
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
Hampstead uh I I forget exactly how you
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
phrased it I wrote it in my head as
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
there's a paperwork problem is all but
 
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
you've got the money in the budget uh
 
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
but what what what are we telling
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
Hampstead these days about when we can
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
write the their next check sure so uh
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
just for context for everyone's
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
awareness so during State fiscal year 23
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
the department made two payments to the
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
town of Hampstead for a total with GNC
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
approval they were unencumbered payment
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
requests for a total of approximately
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
177 800 and change and
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
um in the by during the legislative
 
00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
process during the Senate phase we
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
discussed this we discussed the notion
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
of 178 thousand dollar payment to be
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
made to the town I've already prepped
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
that GNC letter ready to go it should be
 
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
at the July 19th meeting so once we have
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
that authorization from GNC we will go
 
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
ahead and make that hundred and seventy
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
eight thousand dollar payment for State
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and then we look forward
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
to working with members of the
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
legislature on on a future solution
 
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.670 align:start position:0%
legislature on on a future solution
there

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:38.420 align:start position:0%
did you say July 19th
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
I did am I am I getting that wrong I may
 
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
be getting it wrong
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
oh I'm August 5th it's actually a GNC
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
item it's it's not a fiscal item we
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't need to worry about it thank you
 
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
no sir
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
is there a motion for the item
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
some move
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
all right all right motion
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%

discussion

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:13.699 align:start position:0%
seeing none all in favor say aye aye
 
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's a senator Rosenwald had a
 
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:44.570 align:start position:0%
there's a senator Rosenwald had a
question

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
I think my question is well I have a
 
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
couple questions one
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner nice to see you nice to see
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
you too so all told today you're I think
 
00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
asking us to approve 12 million dollars
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
in Arbor funds okay and I'm recalling
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
that when you came to Senate Finance in
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
April you said there were no more our
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
funds available for us to do anything
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
with so
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about that discrepancy so
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
at that point those the pro the programs
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing today were already in
 
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:27.419 align:start position:0%
the pipeline we just hadn't gotten them
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
to the point of uh ready to be brought
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
to fiscal so what you're seeing today
 
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
really is at the very end of the actual
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
items uh that are going to be allocated
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
under this original amount
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
um for the uh State fiscal recovery
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
funds great and I I had questions for
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%

conference

00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
iea hearings I hope that includes the
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
new one at Dartmouth Hitchcock but is
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
that correct uh let judge Gob toll
 
00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:48.539 align:start position:0%
correct me but all drfs are conducting
 
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
video hearings Dartmouth has not
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
established its drf yet
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
okay and if I could follow up so the
 
00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.990 align:start position:0%
okay and if I could follow up so the
hospitals

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
are not doing
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
video conference iea hearings in the
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
emergency department but I'm wondering
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
what happens if someone
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
needs a sign language interpreter
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
for their iea hearing is that being done
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
by telephone or
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
so how is that being handled that's a
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
great question Senator Rosemont thank
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
you for that
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
um we've actually had several of those
 
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
types of hearings and we have been able
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
to make special arrangements with the
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh to in those particular
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
cases it it's a lot of video screens
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
because you need at least two ASL
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
interpreters per Hearing in some cases I
 
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
think we've had three because we've had
 
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
one person on screen and two people in
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
the facility but we have been able to
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
arrange video for that no we're not
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
we're not doing sign language
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation over the phone and that's
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
if I can just add a little bit that's
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
the the fact that we were able to do
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
that when the hospitals knew that was
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
the only way the hearing was going to
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
happen is one of the reasons we've
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
reached out again to ask
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
can we pilot with you to get video on a
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
more regular basis than we are we have
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
about four facilities that are in
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
conversation with us now to potentially
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
start piloting those in the Ed which is
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
where we want to go well I I
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
congratulate the judicial branch for
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
getting us away from telephones I think
 
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.450 align:start position:0%
getting us away from telephones I think
it's

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:34.460 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
Justice may be blind but in this case we
 
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
don't really want it to be thank you
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:16.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
move the item
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
Senator gray moves to adopt 23-182
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald seconds is there any
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
further discussion maybe we have a
 
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
little discussion on this I was I was a
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
little slow
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
um okay I I Edwards has a question we'll
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
wait for somebody to come to answer it
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr sure
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I think I was just a little um
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
challenge with my reading comprehension
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
I could could you just verbally explain
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
good afternoon this is Trish Tilly I am
 
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:55.340 align:start position:0%
the director of Public Health
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
so in general we are working out
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
um a budgeting issue at the end of the
 
00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:02.930 align:start position:0%
um a budgeting issue at the end of the
year

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
um typically we use two a couple of
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
sources of funds to pay for overtime
 
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
sources of funds to pay for overtime
both

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
um Revenue that comes in from licensing
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
fees we are restricted in the amount of
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we can use from licensing
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
fees and then we supplement that
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
additionally with General funds so these
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm just checking with my friend
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
Nathan here
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
um so in here we we do not have enough
 
00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
although we have budgeted licensee fees
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
there isn't enough actually in that
 
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
account and so we need to move some
 
00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539 align:start position:0%
general funds in
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
um there is a statute that limits our
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
ability to collect the licensing fee
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
Revenue Beyond three hundred thousand
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
dollars each year in the current
 
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
biennium there was an error in the
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
original budgeted amount it was three
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars higher than it should
 
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
have been what this request does is
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're transferring unused funds from one
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
account from from the public health
 
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
Laboratories account we're moving that
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
over to this account
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to be writing down
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
the revenue that we can't technically
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
earn within this account in the current
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
in the in the budget that was just
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
approved and signed into law this issue
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
has been rectified so it will no longer
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
be an issue going forward but this is a
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
technical correction to address that
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you Mr Wyatt and Miss
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
Tilley I these two paragraphs didn't say
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
that to me and I it's again it was
 
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
probably my problem with reading but
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the item we've
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
already have a motion in a second for
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%

good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
committee I'm John devivo general
 
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
manager at Franconia Notch State Park
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
and Canon Mountain ski area
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald is recognized for
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
remember last year there was a line for
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
the cost for state employees I don't see
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
it this year and I'm wondering if that
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
got dropped from the collective
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so I don't recall
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
specifically having that line item in
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
there it may have done so at the request
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
of the committee typically that would be
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
part of our winter special use policy
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
where it's uh it's not really an off
 
00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:25.100 align:start position:0%
product but it's something that's
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
non-mainstream that does come before you

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon commissioner so I had a
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
question on the
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
page 9 of 10 where there's a listing of
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
all the transfers from full-time
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
employees special payments
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
and you've taken all the money out of
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
that line throughout the different
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
sections of your budget what was that
 
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.909 align:start position:0%
sections of your budget what was that
for

00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative leech that's a great
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
question because I asked it myself what
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
happened was with the teamsters
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
specifically they bargained a special
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
overtime premium payment and when that
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
was forecasted in our budget the amount
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
we received was over what we anticipated
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
spending so we did have an opportunity
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
in this budget to use it for this
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
purpose and hence why it's before you
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
today it's an atypical line item for us
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you thank you Mr
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
chairman very welcome
 
00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.130 align:start position:0%

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
um commissioner have we budgeted enough
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the 24-25 budget to cover this level
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
of prescription drug spending Senator
 
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald that's a wonderful question
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned we may not have these
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
increases started occurring uh right at
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
the end of the budget finalization
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
process the cost increases that are
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
referenced in the letter that pharmacist
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
Carbone has identified uh keep going up
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
every time I look so I've stopped
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
looking that's a bad joke with that
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
stated they have aggressively started
 
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
looking at potential contracts with
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
specific pharmaceutical providers to try
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
to reduce those costs we're taking very
 
00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
emergent interventions in addition to
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
the inflation reduction act that was
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
signed last August of 2022 that
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
President Biden and the federal
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
government has specifically trying to
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
Target reduction of State United States
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical costs they're staying
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
quite abreast with those opportunities
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
because as you know we take those costs
 
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
very seriously and we're trying to we're
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
trying to slow that inflationary Trend
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
as quickly as we're seeing it happen
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%

just what would
 
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:31.820 align:start position:0%
if I wrote Senator dallasandra thank you
 
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner are we having any luck
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh recruiting
 
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh so that we don't have to uh spend
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
this overtime buddy and we we actually
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
uh take the pressure off those who have
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
to work the overtime over and over and
 
00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
over again how are we doing in terms of
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention uh thank you
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
for that question Senator dalessandro
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the packet on the very
 
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
last page it shows that the average
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
longevity of our Department's employees
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
is hovering almost to 10 years and then
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
on the security specific trending chart
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see the large retirement
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
retirement Spike we saw post covet has
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
started to normalize itself this year so
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
those are two good healthy signs in
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
addition we've been and continue to run
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
a southern based Recruitment and
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
Retention committee with a
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary approach and a

northern uh Recruitment and Retention
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee and those are producing more
 
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
full-time candidates I want to thank the
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
legislature for their support and
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%

00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
vote to continue that ten thousand
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
dollar incentive will continue to make a
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
difference to set our department aside
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
from other law enforcement but as we're
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%

that's also a good sign so right now I
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%

non-benefited relief opportunity that
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%

it's shifting I uh in it is not as bad
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
as the 51 percent so it's headed in the

any questions from the committee members
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Heath has a question
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:30.419 align:start position:0%
for the record Frank edelblue
 
00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education
 
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
Tammy valencourt CFO for education
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner for taking my
 
00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:38.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner for taking my
question

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
um this item is calling for seven
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
um to go toward Renovations at crutched
 
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
Mountain now I'm fairly familiar with
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
cartridge Mountain over the years
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
dealing with it in various different
 
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.129 align:start position:0%
dealing with it in various different
ways

00:34:55.129 --> 00:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that it went out of
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
business and I and now it must be back
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
in business again why are we
 
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.170 align:start position:0%
in business again why are we
um

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:05.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
transferring seven million dollars to
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
crotchet Mountain your explanation
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
didn't answer my question very well yeah
 
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
no problem so let me just give you a
 
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
little bit of background so um the the
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
facility itself did not ever go out of
 
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.670 align:start position:0%
facility itself did not ever go out of
business

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
um working with health and human
 
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
services at a certain point they were
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
prepared to shut down the uh current
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
operator of that business because they
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
were not meeting their required
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
specifications for the operation of that
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
facility when that operator was notified
 
00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
of that they announced an intention to
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
shut down the operation which would have
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
been disruptive both for our DD
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
communities as well as our disabled
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
communities in the student population so
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
we sought individuals outside of that
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
Community who may be interested in
 
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
operating that facility we did locate an
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
organization called Seven Hills which is
 
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts entity it happened to
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
have as its uh president the an
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
individual who ran Cratchit Mountain
 
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
many years ago they agreed to come in
 
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
and operate that particular facility and
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
so they did they stepped in at an
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
emergency basis as a result of that we
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
did not have you know as many as 50
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
students being sent back into
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
residential settings which would have
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
been inappropriate for them as they
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
began to get and so they kind of did
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
this in an emergency type of a basis
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
they negotiated with the former owner to
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
acquire the facilities they so once they
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
got their hands around the facility they
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
began to do an assessment of the
 
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
infrastructure associated with it and
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
they discovered some deficiencies and so
 
00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they they sought
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
from gopher funding to be able to make
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
some of those Capital Improvements to be
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
able to both operate the facility but
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
really put it at its capacity right now
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
they're not able to service all of the
 
00:36:58.810 --> 00:36:58.820 align:start position:0%
needs and so
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
they're not able to operate at their
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
their capacity for their licensure
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
because of some of the deficiencies in
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
the facility so they sought that funding
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
from the from gopher through the ARP
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
funds they were awarded those those
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
funds are being are going to be
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
transferred and managed through the
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I think the the
 
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
choice of the Department of Education
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
was because we have a building aid
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
process that we can manage this type of
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
a construction process through so that's
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
where we will manage it and so that's
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
really I know I know I'm not answering
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
your question why did they get seven
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars and someone else didn't
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
other than that was the award that we
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
is it a pro not profit or for-profit it
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
is a not-for-profit
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
and this will go through the department
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
of Ed why not help in human services so
 
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
I think the reason again it could have
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
probably gone through either one of the
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
agencies I think the reason why the
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education was selected is
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
because we already have processes set up
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
for managing construction projects like
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
this just in our school building Aid
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
processes and so we're just going to run
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
this through as if it were kind of a
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
school building Aid project all right
 
00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:12.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.910 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
so

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
is this going to be just for day
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
students or is the Department of
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
Education going to be
 
00:38:27.609 --> 00:38:27.619 align:start position:0%
setting up
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
and renovating a licensed residential
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
care facility so this includes a
 
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
combination on so remember it includes
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
multiple aspects from an education
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
standpoint we have residential students
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
so these are students with a disability
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
that requires them to be in a 24 7
 
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
residential setting and we also
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
accommodate day students at this
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
facility from the education programming
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
side they're licensed to for up to 105
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
students presently they have 22
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
residential students they have about 15
 
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
to 20 day students that are
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
participating in those programs so they
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
obviously they're not able to fully
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
utilize their license and so it includes
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
a combination now the facility itself
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
also includes you know developmental
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
disability population that would be you
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
know Health and Human Services you know
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
clients are on that same facility the
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing is primarily
 
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
focused around the the educational
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
aspects the educational facilities
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
although clearly the the facility
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
improvements are going to improve things
 
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
like the administration offices required
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
some infrastructure improvements as well
 
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
and that would benefit both of those
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
programs whether it's an education
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
program or a Health and Human Services
 
00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
um our New Hampshire children going to
 
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.310 align:start position:0%
um our New Hampshire children going to
be

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
served in priority versus children from
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
other states they absolutely are I've
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
received personal assurances because I
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
got that question from you all that was
 
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
the intent it is a New Hampshire
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
facility I spoke with the president of
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
Seven Hills and he gave me his
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
assurances relative to that process that
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire resident students
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
would be given priority for the slots
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
that are available both on the
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
residential programming as well as the
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative leishman for a question
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
so according to like local press not
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
that the Press is always correct but
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
there were articles that ran in the
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
local paper that covers this area that
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
said people were laid off the place was
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
shutting down you said it's really never
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
shut down is that correct that's correct
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
and one further question Mr chairman
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
so that the problem with laid items is
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes it doesn't give us a lot of
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
time to do research so what do you know
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
about Seven Hills do they operate
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
similar facilities if they do how many
 
00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:05.099 align:start position:0%
wear that type of thing yeah
 
00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
um so when we were in search of some
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
type of an operator for this facility if
 
00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:11.579 align:start position:0%
we first approach all of our other New
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire operators that operate similar
 
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
facilities to see if they would be
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
interested and then we basically looked
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
at where because oftentimes New
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students are placed in
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
residential facilities outside of New
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so my second tier was I went
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
to the facilities that were outside of
 
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that's where we first
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
came up with Seven Hills that's where we
 
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
source that and then we I literally just
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
reached out to all of those places where
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
um you know students placed and I said
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
is there an interest in this and then
 
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
you know the uh the funnel narrowed
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
until uh Seven Hills was the the
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
individual entity who was open to doing
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
that Seven Hills up operates very
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
similar facilities in Massachusetts that
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
already housed today both as residential
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
or day students New Hampshire students
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
although I don't know if Massachusetts
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
has any day students but they have
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
residential students so they're they're
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
already in the business in terms of
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
these types of facilities which provides
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
us some degree of assurance that they
 
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
will be able to you know effectively
 
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
manage that facility and I do think you
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
know an important aspect is the fact
 
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
that the the president of Seven Hills
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
was the CEO of crotchet Mountain you
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
know like back in the 90s at that point
 
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
in time and so I was familiar with
 
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
um you know the operation the geography
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know the communities around there
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they're serving and I think that
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
that was helpful for us as well
 
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
chair uh good seeing you again Mr
 
00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.589 align:start position:0%
chair uh good seeing you again Mr
commissioner

00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
um so so my questions really kind of
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
relate to the business assurances that
 
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
go along with this money
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
um it says that there's a 15 million
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
dollar need for renovation this is seven
 
00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
million of it uh where is the other 8
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
million coming from assuming it's coming
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
from Seven Hills do we have a guarantee
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
on that and if we spend this money and
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
we do the renovations do we have any
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
assurances about uh how long they will
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
commit to operating if they we spend the
 
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
money it's Federal money we go so it's
 
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
supposed to be wasted I guess but uh
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
that's a joke but uh but I just want to
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
make sure if we invest in renovations
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
that we have good assurances this is
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
going to be an ongoing operation yeah so
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
and again keeping in mind that a lot of
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
this is kind of deferred maintenance
 
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
type of stuff so the assurances that we
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
have received is relative to the
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
projects and this is probably why we're
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
pushing it through our building aid
 
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
process that we will this These funds
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
will be used to do renovation projects
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
that will be able to be completed and
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
put in service all right so my concern
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
was that we would uh you know do half of
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
a building and say like okay well we got
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
part of it done but you can't use the
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
facility because you haven't finished
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
the work so the the only assurance I can
 
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
give you is that
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the work that we're doing
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
we're going to make sure that they
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
complete the facilities that they are
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
working on of the 7 million to the point
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
of them being accessible to New
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students for service in terms
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the uh the rest of the facilities
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
um you know my understanding is at Seven
 
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
Hills is uh you know they may have a
 
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
commitment already or they're in the
 
00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
process of seeking an external
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
commitment from you know a financial
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
institution to be able to complete those
 
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
and I have spoken with one Banker about
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
that already that was connected to me
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
relative to the financing just to
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
understand what that project looks like
 
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and then and then what about
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
any commitments they make to operating
 
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
in the future should we go forward with
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
this project yeah so I mean they're the
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
only commitment we can have again if
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
they if they face some type of
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
insolvency they wouldn't do it but they
 
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
have told us that they are committed to
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
it but we don't have we don't have some
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
type of a written Assurance from them
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure what that would be
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
worth if they faced an insolvency
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
circumstance uh we're probably in a
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
better circumstance to just uh recognize
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
that this is an institution that's
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
already in that business and has had
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
some success in that business uh you're
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
probably referring to the fact that
 
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
crotchet Mountain just in my own tenure
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
as commissioner has changed hands
 
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
several times and uh so we do hope that
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
this one sticks is a good way of
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
describing it but I don't know beyond
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
that if I can provide that Assurance to
 
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:41.890 align:start position:0%
that if I can provide that Assurance to
you

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:41.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative Heath for a question
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I am very uncomfortable with
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this item I really
 
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
think we I think the commission has done
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
a good job of trying to assure us but
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
there are so many unanswered questions
 
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.609 align:start position:0%
there are so many unanswered questions
um

00:45:58.609 --> 00:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
if the chair would be willing could we
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's a legitimate motion you could
 
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
make that motion and see if it passes I
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
would like to make that motion Mr chair
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%

the discussion there should be no
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
discussion to table it's just a straight
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
vote we'll do it by show of hands all in
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%

00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
you know there was a school there was
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
the brain injury situation there was
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of extended care now some of
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
that has has moved in another Direction
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
but what's what's left in operating you
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
said in this in this little presentation
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
there were 31 buildings on the campus
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
well how many of those buildings are
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
still fluctuating
 
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh and and what what are we actually
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
doing at crotchet about as we speak yep
 
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
so I mean I can speak to that directly
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
relative to the education program here
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
today uh they have a license for 105
 
00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:50.099 align:start position:0%
students they're serving 22 residential
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
students they're serving
 
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's somewhere between 12
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
and 21. we're not sure if somebody
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
transposed a number uh day students
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
um but they're serving day students
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
every day all summer
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
um you know failure to move forward with
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
this would require us to find placement
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
for these students in New Hampshire we
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
don't have capacity in our New Hampshire
 
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
um you know service providers at this
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
point in time which would be difficult
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
uh you know some of those residential
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
students may end up in you know out of
 
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:20.339 align:start position:0%
state in New York or in California
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
someplace else from a Health and Human
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
Services standpoint I believe they
 
00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
continue to provide services there as
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
well but I'm not completely familiar
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
with all of the Health and Human
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
Services operations on that facility but
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
I do believe they continue to have the
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
brain injury facility they continue to
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
provide against you know residential and
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
other services to developmental
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities community
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
word for the question
 
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
when would we uh were planning is
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
committed with the Senate we were told
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't any more ability now
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden there's seven billion
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
dollars available for this project where
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
did this seven billion dollars come from
 
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
so the the funds were passed to the
 
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education from gopher
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
right from the a from that facility so
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
we don't manage that facility but that
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
was this grant was provided to us for
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of um you know doing these
 
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.329 align:start position:0%
the purpose of um you know doing these
renovations

00:49:11.329 --> 00:49:11.339 align:start position:0%
renovations
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
so so the the origin of the foods from
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
golf it was inappropriated was it re was
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
it recalculated or was it re was it
 
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
reapportioned so again I don't where did
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
seven million come from all of a sudden
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
we heard there wasn't any money yeah
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
seven billion appears so I don't manage
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
that Grant so I don't know how that
 
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
money came into existence I think Taylor
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
is here and he may be able to respond to
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
Taylor Castle commissioner I am here for
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
gopher so as I had mentioned Senator
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt earlier this was a project
 
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
that we've had in the pipeline now uh
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
for several months uh working with them
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
working with the Seven Hills operation
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
to understand what their needs were
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
going to be where they where the funds
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
that they were requesting uh eligible
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
under arpa what are the expenditure
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
categories that they would fit under
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
those sorts of questions we had to go
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
through a process to uh to move those
 
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
funds to the point of getting them to
 
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
you here today so it is within the
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
category that I had mentioned to Senator
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald that when I spoke really at
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
the last two meetings about how we were
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
done with the obligations under or
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
allocations under under the fiscal
 
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
recovery funds
 
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
um that's true we still have we still
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
had a couple of these items left in the
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
pipeline to bring to you and those are
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
the ones you're seeing today
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Rosenwald for a
 
00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.450 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Rosenwald for a
question

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
when I look at the website for Seven
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
Hills it looks like
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
they deal with clinical
 
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
cases and Behavioral Health so
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
could you please tell us why the grant
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
is going to the Department of Education
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
and not to Health and Human Services yes
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh ma'am as you can imagine that was
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
some subject of discussion I think in
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
the end as commissioner edelblue
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned because these requests are all
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
infrastructure based and renovation
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
based not programmatic in nature I think
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
we felt that uh you know given the
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
management capabilities at Department of
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
Education along projects like this that
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
that was a that was a relevant and
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
and toward that end I mean I know it
 
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
will go through our building a process
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
Amy Clark who I believe you've met in
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
the past so she's an engineer and she's
 
00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.339 align:start position:0%
managing these School building Aid
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
projects projects already so I think
 
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
that you know that was the understanding
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
that we would manage it like a
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question uh
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
um earlier today in HHS oversight
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
um it was uh we were reminded that in HB
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
49 with the sununu center we allocated
 
00:52:07.809 --> 00:52:07.819 align:start position:0%
in that legislation
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
21.6 million in arpa money and we said
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
only arpa money could be spent on the
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
sununu center and so as I'm looking at
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
this seven million dollars and I'm
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
worrying about cost overruns and the
 
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.650 align:start position:0%
worrying about cost overruns and the
like

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.180 align:start position:0%
um I I really want to see that sununi
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
Center built the department in testimony
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
said that they think they've got a good
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
estimate that they're going to come
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
under it but I'm just still interested
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
in your perspective on contingency
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
reallocation of funding because in terms
 
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
of higher priorities I would still put
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
this in a new center above this project
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
and I I don't want to I don't want to
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
short something
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
right neither do we uh Representatives
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
so I think as as you know we've been
 
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.559 align:start position:0%
through the last couple of months now
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
um uh and I guess it was I think it was
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
at the May meeting where we extended the
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
spending deadlines under arpa
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
expenditures that you've approved
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
through uh the next fiscal year but only
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
until June 30th of 2024. the reason for
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
that is because we have an obligation
 
00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
deadline at the end of 2024 and December
 
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
31st of 2024. so effectively that will
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
give us an opportunity to see and give
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
agencies and others uh the next year to
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
burn through those expenditures at a
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
rate that are going to be able to get us
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
to a full expenditure down as close down
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
to zeros we can get it by that December
 
00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:45.059 align:start position:0%
30th 24. so having a deadline of a year
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
from now gives us that opportunity to
 
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
get a check in on how that's going now I
 
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
don't mean to wait we're waiting for a
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
year to see how everyone's doing we're
 
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
working with all agencies on a very
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
regular basis and the the dashboard on
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
our website gives that number updated on
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
a quarterly basis which correlates with
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements that we have
 
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:08.339 align:start position:0%
for reporting so I guess what I'm saying
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
is that we have left room at the end of
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
this to have affirm ideas to how those
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
funds are going to be spent over the
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
last six months of the obligation period
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
a year from now and it'd be at that
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
point that we'll see you know how what
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
are the priorities what are we going to
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
have get done during that time period
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
um because even if you and I don't mean
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
to confuse the matter but even if you
 
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
get beyond that 2024 deadline we still
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
have until 2026 to spend everything so
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
the obligation deadline I'm referring to
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
is the end of December 2024.
 
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:42.109 align:start position:0%
is the end of December 2024.
um

00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thank you Mr
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking I hope my
 
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
last question you said that based on
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
your letter on your testimony that is
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
about 15 million dollars needed to
 
00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
address a number of things from parking
 
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
lots to housing heating water treatment
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
but there's no guarantee that Seven
 
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
Hills is going to come up with that
 
00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
other eight million dollars is there so
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
which is why we've tried to structure
 
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
the work such that the this money as
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's invested will be in assets so that
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
they can be put into service
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
um so they may need to uh you know redo
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
some other things but that's deferred
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance um you know even just
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
earlier today I was at a university
 
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire board meeting
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we've got you know a large deferred
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance number there as well it
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that those
 
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
um you know facilities are not
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
functioning but it's deferred
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance and so what we've done is
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
we've prioritized the things that are
 
00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
going to benefit the educational
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
see no further discussion I'm looking
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.609 --> 00:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
23. Bradley
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
Senator green moves Senator Bradley
 
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.500 align:start position:0%

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
six all the posts
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much chairman Weiler
 
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
item 23203 consistent with the
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
provisions in House Bill 2 which allows
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
the appointing authority of the
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
legislative branch employees to Grant uh
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
the pay raise which was granted to the
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
state employees as well as the
 
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
legislative employees this morning of 10
 
00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:32.339 align:start position:0%
effective July 14 2023 2 effective July
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon Mr chair and members
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Katya Fox I'm the
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
director of the division for Behavioral
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
Health and yes we have seen the letter
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
we were sent a copy at the same time you
 
00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.470 align:start position:0%
we were sent a copy at the same time you
were

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
um and what is stated in that letter is
 
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
correct we have been working over the
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
last several months and this has come
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
before this committee before this issue
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
was raised and we have our data
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
analytics team working with the
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
association and their data analytics
 
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
team and we continue to reconcile the
 
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.289 align:start position:0%
team and we continue to reconcile the
numbers

00:59:09.289 --> 00:59:09.299 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
um what I believe they've referenced is
 
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
the fact that of course they've served
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
individuals our dashboard shows zeros
 
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
for the last several months and that's
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
because as we've been taking this time
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're providing in a
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
very transparent way the information
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
about how many are being served I did
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
receive a prototype of the information
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
that will be forthcoming in future
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
dashboards and we'll be sharing that
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
with you hopefully as as early as your
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
next meeting which I'm not sure what it
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
how big was the discrepancy in numbers
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
so I I don't have that in front of me
 
00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.390 align:start position:0%
so I I don't have that in front of me
today

00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:59:59.329 --> 00:59:59.339 align:start position:0%
but I think what has been of concern by
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
the centers and our concern as well it
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't reflecting the increase in the
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
numbers of individuals being served so I
 
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number of what the
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
discrepancy was but we are showing an
 
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
increased trend line knowing of course
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
that we've added a number of services
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
but they also have been constrained by
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
Workforce and we're hoping with the
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases and other
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
measures that are being taken that will
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
be able to support everybody who has a
 
01:00:31.799 --> 01:00:33.470 align:start position:0%
be able to support everybody who has a
need

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
so did I understand you to say you've
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
taken steps to get this more accurate in
 
01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:39.299 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely one we want to be
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
able to do that and we want to make sure
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
that we talk about the limitations of
 
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
the data and the data that the centers
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
have versus what the department has and
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to present all of
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
that so that you have a better
 
01:00:59.210 --> 01:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's happening out in
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
your communities
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for addressing this concern
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
I guess we are ready to move on to the
 
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.990 align:start position:0%
I guess we are ready to move on to the
audit

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute about the dashboard
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
better Senator Rosenwald for a question
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
not about this piece
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
about the dcyf
 
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:31.670 align:start position:0%
about the dcyf
peace

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.049 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:01:42.049 --> 01:01:42.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
when I look at
 
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.430 align:start position:0%
when I look at
table

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.470 align:start position:0%
table
four

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
it shows that in April
 
01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:52.450 align:start position:0%
it shows that in April
the

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:52.460 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:56.089 --> 01:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
dcyf for referrals fell by about
 
01:01:56.099 --> 01:01:58.789 align:start position:0%
dcyf for referrals fell by about
two-thirds

01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
two-thirds
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm just
 
01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.809 align:start position:0%
and I'm just
wondering

01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:06.530 align:start position:0%
wondering
what happened

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:11.579 align:start position:0%
that's a giant decrease
 
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Marie Noonan
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm the interim director for dcyf
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
and so I'm not sure exactly the point in
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
time that the data was pulled it could
 
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
be that it wasn't the full complete
 
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
month in April
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
um it it also could in fact be that
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
March was a higher number because if you
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
look at March it was a thousand and then
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
the 937 is more in line with the other
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
months so it could just be that in in
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
the month of March we saw an increase in
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
call volume and assessments to to the
 
01:02:41.819 --> 01:02:44.030 align:start position:0%
call volume and assessments to to the
agency

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
um well if I look at thank you if I go
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
back really for about seven or eight
 
01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.569 align:start position:0%
back really for about seven or eight
months

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:02:57.490 --> 01:02:57.500 align:start position:0%
it was over two thousand
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
I see that yes
 
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
um could you get back to us absolutely
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:11.339 align:start position:0%
further questions for HHS
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:42.540 align:start position:0%

control comments none of which are
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
material weaknesses and none of which
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%

observation number one discusses risk
 
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.420 align:start position:0%

control
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
we recommended the department adhere to
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
the requirements established in their
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%

lacked a formal review and approval
 
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:18.140 align:start position:0%
we recommended the department review
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
reconciliations for completeness
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%

we recommended the department Implement
 
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
a formal review in approval control
 
01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:24.539 align:start position:0%

administrative services
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
and work with administrative services to
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
develop a more formal reporting process
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:39.799 align:start position:0%

supporting Department operations have
 
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
not been kept current
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
we recommended the department review and
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
revise policies and procedures to reduce
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
the risk of disruption in operations due
 
01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
to the departure of key employees
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
and to implement a monitoring control to
 
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:04.700 align:start position:0%
help ensure policies and procedures
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
remain up to date and reflect current
 
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.549 align:start position:0%
remain up to date and reflect current

01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
here we note the department does not
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
consistently record expenditures in the
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
correct accounting period
 
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
we recommended the department
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
established controls to improve the
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%

01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
and require vendors with significant
 
01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:35.900 align:start position:0%
contracts to remit invoices timely
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
especially prior to the state's fiscal
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner Aura Lemire
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
business administrator Shelly garlano
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
and Senior financial analyst Lauren
 
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
O'Sullivan who worked very hard with the
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
LBA during this process it was an
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
enjoyable process for the agency that
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
typically is the one doing the auditing
 
01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
we appreciate at times being the uh or
 
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
one being the auditor we appreciate
 
01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
being the Oddity it's interesting to sit
 
01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the table we thank
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
the LBA very much for their time effort
 
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
and energy during this audit and I'm
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions about any
 
01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
of the observations
 
01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:50.219 align:start position:0%
I don't believe most of that staff was
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
there five years ago when the previous
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
audit was done is that so that is
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
correct we've had quite a bit of
 
01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.050 align:start position:0%
correct we've had quite a bit of
turnover

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
um over the past few years
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so they definitely got their feet wet
 
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
as part so you read the previous audit
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
and knew what to expect right very good
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to get you to comment on
 
01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:16.100 align:start position:0%
the prior year item number five
 
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
and apparently it relates back to the
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
finding five this year just trying to
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
give you a chance to comment sure so um
 
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
item number five from this year which is
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
also noted as being unresolved from the
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
prior audit so
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
um the and that also relates to the
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
letter that you have as well with the
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
five hundred and nineteen thousand
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
dollar entry that is the result of two
 
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.010 align:start position:0%
dollar entry that is the result of two
invoices

01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
invoices
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
um one invoice we did Miss putting a
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
double asterisk on that invoice when we
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
were paying it in order to bring it into
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
the prior year that invoice was
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
immaterial it was around forty thousand
 
01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.250 align:start position:0%
immaterial it was around forty thousand
dollars

01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
the second invoice was more significant
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
that invoice was received from a vendor
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
past the 60-day period that the
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
allows us to note that it should have
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
been paid in the prior year so we did
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
not have the option
 
01:12:18.169 --> 01:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
um to essentially
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
note it for the prior year
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
so we uh there's two things that are
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to happen going forward one we're
 
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
going to contact our vendors as the year
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
is ending to make sure that we receive
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
the invoices in a timely manner and two
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
I believe the department of
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
administrative Services is going to
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
extend that 60-day window to 90 days so
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
if that if the window was 90 days then
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
we would have been able to
 
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
reflect that payment appropriately but
 
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was not an option to do
 
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
that because the invoice had been
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't see the commissioner shaking
 
01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
his head that he was going to 90 days
 
01:13:02.649 --> 01:13:02.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
chair I want to talk about the way
 
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
um on page 12 item five is written up
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
the first sentence review with the Das
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriate accounts payable
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures that should be
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
employed to report accounts payable at
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal year
 
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
as I read that sentence it suggests that
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
there's a a training shortfall that
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
employees are not being trained properly
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
on uh on the policies and procedures of
 
01:13:46.729 --> 01:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
accounts payable but then as I listen to
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
your two examples that sounds like
 
01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.550 align:start position:0%
your two examples that sounds like
understandable

01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
mistakes in a very busy system and so so
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if that first sentence
 
01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:00.020 align:start position:0%
is really
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
reflective of the kind of corrective
 
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.610 align:start position:0%
reflective of the kind of corrective
procedure

01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm
 
01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
I believe this is an overview of the
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
findings from our 2014 audit and whether
 
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
or not they are resolved so that
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
language is from 2014.
 
01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
the issue that happened in this audit is
 
01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
different as I just explained but
 
01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
um the LBA has decided that it is
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
similar enough to this finding this
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
previous finding that they're they're
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
treating them essentially the same
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
oh mayor
 
01:14:41.930 --> 01:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
okay so what what you said just actually
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
makes me a little bit more nervous
 
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
that that that there's no that this is
 
01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
still an unresolved issue even though it
 
01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
came in 2014 and this is as basic as
 
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
reviewing the procedures with the people
 
01:15:00.649 --> 01:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
who are supposed to implement them and
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's just hard to imagine
 
01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
I guess the
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
due in 2014 was reviewing the procedures
 
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
we have obviously since done that
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
however during this audit there was the
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
one forty thousand roughly forty
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar invoice that was missed
 
01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
and so it is deemed that it is still not
 
01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:24.470 align:start position:0%
and so it is deemed that it is still not
resolved

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
okay I I guess I'd want to give you at
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
least one dot then I appreciate it the
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
remediation and process I appreciate
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thanks Mr
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
chairman and seeing that the department
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
of audits and
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
forgives interest and penalties I think
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
they've done a pretty good job so they
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't need any interest in penalties
 
01:15:56.209 --> 01:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you is it
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
and if so could we thank him for his
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
yes I am retiring next month so
 
01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh if I may if I can say a

yes
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane and I've decided we don't need
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
to meet in July
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
did I mention I'll be in
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
English so we might move the August
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
meeting a little
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
closer to the uh beginning of the month
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
than the Third
 
01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.410 align:start position:0%
than the Third
Friday

01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
so 8 11 is that a problem
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
August 11th I won't be here I have a
 
01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.070 align:start position:0%
August 11th I won't be here I have a
conference

01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
all right you will be absent
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
it will be it will be available in the
 
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
afternoon but not in the morning
 
01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
how many other people are affected by
 
01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
you have all alternates at uh in the
 
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
Senate yes we do
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
so if we met Friday morning at 10
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
we'd be missing one but I'm always EX
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
excited about how faithful all our
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
alternates are they show up every
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
meeting so I don't think we'll have a
 
01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.030 align:start position:0%
meeting so I don't think we'll have a
problem

01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
she had a conflict in the morning as the
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon acceptable to the rest of the
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
it's hard to anticipate but if the
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
afternoon will work for there's any
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
problem to the Friday afternoon the 11th
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
one o'clock will work
 
01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:23.420 align:start position:0%
all right we'll do it again at one
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
on August 11th and then from then on for
 
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
the rest of the year we will likely meet
 
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
on the third Friday
 
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
so if that's going to be a problem let
 
01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
me know otherwise we'll plan for that
 
01:20:36.659 --> 01:20:37.669 align:start position:0%
me know otherwise we'll plan for that
from

01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%

motion to adjourn and a second all in
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
favor say aye aye
 
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
