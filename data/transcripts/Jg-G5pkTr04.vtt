the content of the bill as drafted

except for an amendment that would
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
change it so that it was clearly
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
delineated that all costs for membership
 
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
in the compact would be incurred
 
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 align:start position:0%

anyone have any questions or thoughts on
 
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
good it sounds like we're all in
 
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.630 align:start position:0%
good it sounds like we're all in

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 align:start position:0%
so based on that
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
i am going to go ahead and
 
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
call the role we'll vote on this
 
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
amendment or vote on the on the bill
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
for referral to the full committee
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%

and i will move out to pass with
amendment

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
don't you have to move the amendment
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i have to do it that way
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
in a subcommittee
 
00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:51.910 align:start position:0%
in a subcommittee
um

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
pam do i have to do it that way in the
 
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.350 align:start position:0%
pam do i have to do it that way in the
subcommittee

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we usually mirror the same
 
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.270 align:start position:0%
yeah we usually mirror the same
approach

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
that we do in the world i mean it's it's
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
certainly casual but
 
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah um the only reason is because i
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
don't have like an amendment number or
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
anything but um
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
right it's more a conceptual you know
 
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
you can refer to the broderick
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
amendment you know
 
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.390 align:start position:0%
amendment you know
okay

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay in that case i will move the
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh it just looks basically like we
 
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
agreed to it's pretty straightforward so
 
00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.350 align:start position:0%
agreed to it's pretty straightforward so
yeah

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
exactly what we agreed to any further
 
00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.110 align:start position:0%
exactly what we agreed to any further
discussion

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will call the role
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the uh the drafting error
 
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
of the uh the drafting error
um

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
i thought we'd discuss it more in full
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
committee but if you wouldn't mind pam
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
if you could just give a quick uh brief
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the to the subcommittee on what what
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
we're what we're going to have to do
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
sure i wouldn't mind it
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's um it sounds a little a lot more
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
confusing than it really is but there's
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
just a drafting error on pages three and
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
four of the bill
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
which is the very beginning of part five
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
and and if you look at page three
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
line 32 you can see that
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
they're adding language about the
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
audiology and speech language pathology
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
compact to 329 d2
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
and you see section 1 there
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
but then if you look on page 4 line 17
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
the same language is repeated only it's
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
inserted into 326 f15
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
which is where speech language pathology
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
the speech language pathology practice
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
act is
 
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.150 align:start position:0%
act is
so

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
so there was some discussion about
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
apparently or some
 
00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.670 align:start position:0%
apparently or some
some

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
competing ideas about whether this new
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
compact language should be put into a
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
new into 329d which is currently where
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
the psychology
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
compact is and they it looks like they
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to make 329 d
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
a a chapter with all occupational
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
compacts in it
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
but then alternatively there was a
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
thought to put it into the speech
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
language pathology practice act so we
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
just need to pick one that's all that's
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
all that really needs to be done and the
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
duplicative language removed from the
 
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.070 align:start position:0%
duplicative language removed from the
bill

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
what i had thought is i was going to
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
reach out one more time to oplc
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
just to ensure what their preference is
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
then discuss it at the full committee
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
to see which way we were going to go on
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
go ahead i'm sorry what this is what i
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
say um tom broderick is here um
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know we can bring him over to to
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
talk about it if you want
 
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that'll be good just so we can get
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
the preference on it what they were
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.430 align:start position:0%
trying to do
sure

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
okay while we're waiting for him may i
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
say something
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead representation
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for uh mr chairman
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
where you're headed i'm very comfortable
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
with but uh
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
the only thing is that because
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit a little bit tricky
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh and we have to make a decision as to
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
which the better way is to go uh
 
00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:44.630 align:start position:0%
which the better way is to go uh
and

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.509 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
so that the full committee understands
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on uh uh it might be well
 
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.910 align:start position:0%
what's going on uh uh it might be well
to

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
if if tom is going to be available
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
to talk to the full committee which i
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
she is here muted
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
and i can't unmute the room from up here
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
so uh-huh okay um well it is that that's
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
just my thought
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
so that the full committee understands
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we're making kind of a fundamental
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
decision how we want to proceed and
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
having tom explain it to the full
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
committee so that we're all on board is
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
my thought
 
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.790 align:start position:0%
my thought
but

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'll defer to the
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
chair's judgment with regard to how we
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
want to proceed at this moment
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative smith that
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
was my initial inclination but i'd still
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
if he's available for the subcommittee
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
just so we can all understand what we're
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
voting on oh oh i i totally i i totally
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
get it that the the subcommittee should
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
certainly be a prized initially uh so
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
that they do know what they're you know
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
what you're voting on it's just that
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
that we want to have the full committee
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
understand because we're making kind of
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
a commitment how we want to structure
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
this so
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
but i i think the the the
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding with the subcommittee at this
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
point is a is the right way to do it
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
pam when is the full committee meeting
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
to discuss the whole bill
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to have some discussions
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
this afternoon or this morning after the
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
other builds are exact
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so we can we can discuss it
 
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.190 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so we can we can discuss it
again

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
quickly and we can i'm sure mr broderick
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
were available uh mr broderick can you
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
just give us a quick rundown which
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
direction you were trying to head with
 
00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.990 align:start position:0%
direction you were trying to head with
that

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for having me i
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
so i don't think oplc has a strong
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
preference i think a we have a slight
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
preference for putting it in the
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
individual practice acts
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that really is if you
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
know if i'm a physical therapist i'm
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
going to know to look in my
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
physical therapy practice act um
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
for the statutes that govern
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
uh i might not know to go to a separate
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
chapter on compacts however i don't
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
think it's a strong preference i don't
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
think that should well that should not
 
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.829 align:start position:0%
think that should well that should not
kill

00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
kill
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
kill the compacts at all though
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and then to um
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
to get to representative schmidt's point
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to be there i'm planning on
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
um listening in the full uh
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
committee meeting and
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'll be on mute doing other work but i
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
can jump on whenever needed
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to get a quick uh
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
summary of what you were thinking and we
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
will discuss it at the full committee
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
and decide which way is the best way to
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
go for clarity purposes
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
i have to say i don't feel comfortable
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
this if we're going to be doing
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
something if we haven't decided which
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
road we're going down at the beginning
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
and this point how can we vote on this
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
well because this isn't a substantive
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
change to the bill it's just the
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
drafting error as to which section of
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
the law it's going to go into
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think that if we
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
can vote
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
on the substantive part of the bill
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
with regard to the um to the amendment
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
we did
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
deciding as a full committee where to
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
put in law i think um at least the
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has has heard
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
and decided on the substance of the of
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
and the the technicality the full
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee can decide on um i would just
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
like to make that recommendation that as
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
um pending this a decision from the full
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
committee on where to put it in the bill
 
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:36.870 align:start position:0%
committee on where to put it in the bill
in

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
the statutes we can go ahead and vote
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative gordon
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
it does i'm still you know
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
as a result since we're
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
in the discussion mode about the bill
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
i do have some hesitancy about this
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
compact arrangement because
 
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.310 align:start position:0%
compact arrangement because
um

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
we have been in
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
like being the first one or one of the
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
first ones
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to be one of the first
 
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.910 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to be one of the first
states

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
i like that i feel more comfortable if
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
they're a little bit more proven
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
and the argument is always well we want
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
to see to the table
 
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.430 align:start position:0%
to see to the table
and

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for other people in the
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
committee to convince me that this is a
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
um i'll respond first
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
um i believe that we are the state is a
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
member of numerous compacts already that
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
we've been this isn't the first
 
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.670 align:start position:0%
we've been this isn't the first
um

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
so i think we do have some experience
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
with how they work we would get the
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
whole seat at the table with this
 
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
particular compact but as far as
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
compacts in general go i believe that
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
we're a member of quite a few of them
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
already and have been for some time does
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to speak on that
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that that's part of what
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
she's saying and
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative grota correct me if
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong it sounds like one of your
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
concerns is
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
if we are one of the first to join this
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
particular compact that has a whole
 
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.030 align:start position:0%
particular compact that has a whole
other

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
layer of dimensions to it i personally
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
am comfortable with it in this case you
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
know it's like to me as long as the
 
00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:22.949 align:start position:0%
know it's like to me as long as the
profession

00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:24.069 align:start position:0%
profession
um

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
it says and the people in that
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
profession say that this is something
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
that they want
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with it you know there
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
are there is a disputed one that we're
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
taking up on a different
 
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.150 align:start position:0%
taking up on a different
compact

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
compact
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
um that's already in process but um
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know we have some different opinions
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
on that but for this one i don't think
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
we really heard any
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to this at all if i remember
 
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.150 align:start position:0%
opposition to this at all if i remember
correctly

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
correct you're correct
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh i'm comfortable with it as
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
well i mean
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners and the board have no
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
problem with it it looks pretty
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward and we've dealt with
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
compacts before
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure you know what
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
what would go wrong that would give us
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
pause in doing this at this point
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
if i could just weigh in for a second
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
here again
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh i i think that uh i my understanding
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
that the stakeholders the practitioners
 
00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:28.839 align:start position:0%
uh want this uh it's it's not being uh
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
imposed or
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
dictated by oplc it's the practitioners
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
who want it that's why we're proceeding
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
right but i'd like to get i'd like to
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
get that confirmed so that uh so by one
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the practitioners so it's not
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
an assumption that turns out to be an
 
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.990 align:start position:0%
an assumption that turns out to be an
inaccurate

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.949 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
i mean mr broderick are you still there
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
i am yes oh am i needed no
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
no you're good go ahead uh yeah so the
 
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.710 align:start position:0%
no you're good go ahead uh yeah so the
in

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.389 align:start position:0%
in
um

00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
in working on this this compact we
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
reached out to the associations here in
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the uh let's see it's the
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy association um
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
expressed that they're in strong support
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
um the speech language pathology
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
association you heard from the national
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
um representative um but
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
both the board and the
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire chapters association are
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
on board with that
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
the audiology
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
association i i think i see that the um
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
someone from
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
that association might be on um or a
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
representative but uh
 
00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.310 align:start position:0%
representative but uh
they

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
wanted at first to learn a bit more
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
about the compact so we went into their
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
meetings explained a bit how compacts
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
worked and they ended up um
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh i believe in support definitely not
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
opposing it i believe that they are
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
supportive so speech language pathology
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
association strongly supports ot
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
association strongly sports
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
um i believe that the
 
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.829 align:start position:0%
um i believe that the
audiology

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
audiology
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
association um got to support but they i
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
does that help you go ahead
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
oh this is representative schultz i was
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
just gonna say
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
i um
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
for whatever it's worth
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
would definitely support
 
00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:30.470 align:start position:0%
would definitely support
um

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the error of how you know the
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
conflicting parts to included in the
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
specific parts of the law for those
 
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
specific parts of the law for those
professions

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
professions
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
that um because i don't i guess they're
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
all in it's all in one part of the law
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
but i so then i would definitely be
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
supportive of it being in
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
that professions
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
section even though it looks like this
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
compact language might
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
be something that will be
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
sort of boilerplate from here on out on
 
00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:05.510 align:start position:0%
sort of boilerplate from here on out on
um

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
jax if i understand that correctly but
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
including it specifically to these
 
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
including it specifically to these
professions

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
professions
 
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.029 align:start position:0%
professions
um

00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
in that part of the law i would
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
definitely be supportive of that for
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
whatever that's worth
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i i tend to agree after
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
hearing from oplc um and we will put
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
that to the full committee to to make
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
that decision because that's that's kind
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
of a quality policy decision that will
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
affect all the compacts how we move
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
forward so it's better to have the full
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
committee weigh in on that and get
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
carol's input on that too
 
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.150 align:start position:0%
carol's input on that too
um

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative grower do you feel
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable voting on the uh on the on
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
the uh bill as amended
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
at this point for subcommittee purposes
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
yes i will say
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll bring this up in subcommittee
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know if these compacts are
 
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.870 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know if these compacts are
audited

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
audited
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
at some time or or a review is done of
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
the compact to see what the benefits
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
were for new hampshire and if there is
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
no benefit
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
then i would like to know how we can
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
withdraw ourselves from them so
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
um just let's just make a note of that i
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
do think that
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's easy to always move ahead with
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
something but when you don't look back
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
at what the ramifications were you can
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
lose sight of what you've done
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
or the effect of what you've done and i
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
think that it's important to do that
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
i think you're absolutely correct and i
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
i believe on one of the other bills we
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that they do track um
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
the use and benefit of the compact and
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
as far as withdrawal we see that process
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
coming up in
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
one of the other sections
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
um where a withdrawal attempt is being
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
made so um we will explore that i firmly
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
believe in some depth at the full
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
community meeting
 
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
community meeting
um

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay so we're running on time here i'm
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
gonna go ahead since everyone seems to
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
be on board
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
call the roll on we'll actually know
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
first i'm going to move off the pass
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
with amendment
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:13.590 align:start position:0%
any one second

specified part 5
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes part 5
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
133 with amendment that's what the
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment we just voted on not the
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
decision on uh how to fix the
 
00:20:25.919 --> 00:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
decision on uh how to fix the
duplication

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
duplication
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%

no but for
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to be so picky but for
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
clarification we should probably
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
state the um and if i could let's insert
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
part five it's the um
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's the amendment from mr broderick
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%

all right so it is
 
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:46.850 align:start position:0%

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:52.789 align:start position:0%
it probably is a safer practice
[Music]

at the uh child at child care level
and

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
there was uh objection because
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
of watering down of standards
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
and while er i think if i'm reading the
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
committee correctly
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak for anyone but i
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
hope i'm recapping this accurately the
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
committee was in support of the fact
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
that we did not want to see
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
standards watered down but there is
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
present crisis and the immovable force
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
versus the unmovable object of getting
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
working parents back into the workforce
 
00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:44.710 align:start position:0%
working parents back into the workforce
um

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:48.229 --> 00:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
probably at least in the short run
 
00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:53.589 align:start position:0%

we didn't want to

water watered-down standards we wanted
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they were not
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
excessively academic for the position
 
00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:11.430 align:start position:0%
excessively academic for the position
because

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
supervisor or kid
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
and that is does not require the
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
academic standards that urban childhood
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
education does
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's also less expensive
 
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.510 align:start position:0%
it's also less expensive
and

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
is not that we don't have qualified
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
teachers for we it's we don't have hope
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have daycare workers who are
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
willing to work for what we're willing
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.109 align:start position:0%
okay
in

00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
except

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
except
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
in either case
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh the committee felt that
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
was that introduced by representative
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
walter was meritorious
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh there were some questions about
 
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.990 align:start position:0%
uh there were some questions about
uh

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
there was a big question about
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
documented life's experience uh and we
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
heard objections to that because it was
 
00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.710 align:start position:0%
heard objections to that because it was
not

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.390 align:start position:0%
not
defined

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.910 align:start position:0%
defined
and

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
there were words came in
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
we had words that uh
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
gave specific examples of what life's
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
experience was and i had asked to
 
00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:44.870 align:start position:0%
experience was and i had asked to
add

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
more closely related activities
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i think where we left off i hope
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
where we left off is that tom broderick
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
do something with that because i don't
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
have those words with me right now and i
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
that i think that can only mean that mr
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
broderick is working on that i hope he's
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
there somewhere
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i can't find those words either but
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
i have them is is this the email that
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
you um sent out carol
 
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.510 align:start position:0%
you um sent out carol
yes

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay just a moment because i made
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
comments to those words
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
and i didn't realize that we okay this
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
is the words that you had sent and this
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
was my comment
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
documented life experience shall include
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
work for a family care provider
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
service so this is these are the things
 
00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
service so this is these are the things
that

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
document life experience
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
work for a family care provider
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
service as a foster parent
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
work as a school teacher
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
work as a camp counselor
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
and experience as a group leader for
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
children in sports and other activities
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
such as scouts or little league
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
and you had spoken with mary jane
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
and she agreed that the wording would be
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
a good idea i'm not sure she agreed to
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
this wording but i know that she is to
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
the word it was a good idea because i
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
spoke to her separately about this
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
what my comments were
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that these
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
experiences include groups of children
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
fostering one child in your home is
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
different than being with a group of
 
00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:22.550 align:start position:0%
different than being with a group of
children

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
so i wrote my suggestion was i'm sorry
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to do this
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
without the words but
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
my i left the the sentences that
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire wrote and i added
 
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.550 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire wrote and i added
each

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.430 align:start position:0%
each
each

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
in each of these cases the experience
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
that shall involve three or more
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
children during these
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
so i just don't think being one-on-one
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
with a child
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
is the same thing as being in a room
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
full of children and some of these life
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
experiences some of these experiences
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned in the wording did
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
not it did not
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
indicate that it was a group of children
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
that needed to be part of the experience
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a child
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that's important
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
but other than that i'm okay with the
 
00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:11.109 align:start position:0%
but other than that i'm okay with the
words

00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
and if you would like i can forward this
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
please do
 
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
please do
um

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
before uh okay uh do we or do we have
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
any guests
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
i disagree with that the only one of
 
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.349 align:start position:0%
i disagree with that the only one of
those

00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
experiences that would be with a single
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
child would likely be a foster parent
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
which would which might equally be with
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
more than one
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
but if that does involve taking care of
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
a child who is not your own so i think
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's relevant
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to add that this is in
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
addition to the thousand hours of
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
supervised child care experience in a
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
licensed child care program
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
so if somebody got interested in taking
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
care of kids with a
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
single foster child and then spent 30
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
spent a thousand hours
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
which is approximately six months
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
working in a supervised child care in a
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
licensed child care program supervised
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
filed by a licensed
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
person with more experience and more
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
training and they're still interested
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
i think we should give them credit for
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
i mean it's not as if that would be
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
and i think adding
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
three minimum of three children is
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
excessively restricted well i think it's
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
you can't avoid it with the other
 
00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:45.190 align:start position:0%
you can't avoid it with the other
activities

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that's do i understand that what do
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
you mean you can't avoid it if you are
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
doing any of the activities other than
 
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.670 align:start position:0%
doing any of the activities other than
um

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
foster care uh you're going to be
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
involving more than uh
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
you'll be involving several children
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to imagine little
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
league or uh
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
the other things that you're talking
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
are enumerated involving less than fewer
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure it's not if the question
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
my statement well i'll let the committee
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
i do think it has to be fostering one
 
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.990 align:start position:0%
i do think it has to be fostering one
child

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
or having one child at home
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
i can just know i can tell you from my
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
own experience
 
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.670 align:start position:0%
own experience
is

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
is a breeze compared to having
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
two or three
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
having one you're focused on one person
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
one little person
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
and if something should happen if you're
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
if you're with two people and you're
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
you're taking care of one and one falls
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
down and hurts themselves who's watching
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
the other one
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to do that and i'm
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
not convinced that
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
fostering one child or having one child
 
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.430 align:start position:0%
fostering one child or having one child
is

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
any parent who has more than one child
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
can tell you this
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
so i don't know why this is such a
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's not restrictive it's common sense
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
i i disagree i know you do carol i mean
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representing mcguire i know
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
you do
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
i think that the
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with multiple children in the
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
licensed child care system is enough to
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
cover that aspect of it where did you
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
have you have a foster child there you
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
are responsible for taking care of
 
00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.150 align:start position:0%
are responsible for taking care of
and

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
being responsible for
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
a child who was not your own which is
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
one of the important distinctions and
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
why i included foster children foster
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
parent in this list of
 
00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:55.990 align:start position:0%
parent in this list of
experiences

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
you also get a chance to observe
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
some stages of growth which may or may
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
not be applicable to any other child but
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
at least you
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
get some experience in seeing how
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:11.589 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative i don't see this as being
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
a practical a practical problem
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it's nice but i i don't see
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
something we have to worry about i will
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
take your advice
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative jack and i respect the uh
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
the ability to have this conversation
 
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
the ability to have this conversation
and

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
um i'll think about it
 
00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:38.790 align:start position:0%
um i'll think about it
well

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's not that what you're not saying
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense it's just that i
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
think it's more or less self-correcting
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think is a practical matter day
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
to day if this paragraph is used in vote
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be finding a
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
situation involving um
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's like please do not read this sign
 
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.349 align:start position:0%
it's like please do not read this sign
right

00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to um i'm fine i don't
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
really i don't need to talk about this
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
anymore and i did send the words to
 
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.550 align:start position:0%
anymore and i did send the words to
um

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
miss spar of smarling so if you could
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
please forward that to the committee
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
because i don't have everyone's
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry sure
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
yes i'll send it around to everybody
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
this this wording change was in response
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
to a concern
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
by the licensing unit that
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
documented life experiences was too
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
vague and broad and unable to be
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
implemented properly so
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
we're specifying the kinds of life
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
experiences that we think are to be
 
00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.750 align:start position:0%
experiences that we think are to be
considered

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
as documented life experience
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
in lieu of academic training
 
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.030 align:start position:0%
in lieu of academic training
for

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
i will agree with that
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
i have a couple more things
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
first um
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
is there any sentiment that we should
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
include free of phrase like or closely
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not hot about that but it seems like
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
because of this list is so it enumerates
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
if you work for the ymca but not the
 
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
ywca uh oh
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
you know do we
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm okay with that what do the other
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative side tech could you
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
repeat what you
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
that last
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is there is a list of
 
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.589 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is there is a list of
specific

00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
examples of what documented life's
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
experience is
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying if something got missed
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
if you can say it is a closely related
 
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.589 align:start position:0%
if you can say it is a closely related
activity

00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i use the example it's not here but
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
if let's say the list said ymca but you
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
work for the ywca well come on
 
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.910 align:start position:0%
work for the ywca well come on
right

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
so leaving us
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's my purpose
 
00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.670 align:start position:0%
that's my purpose
yeah

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation in a reasonable way
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
well i'm trying or closely related i
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
wanted i don't want this to be the barn
 
00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.790 align:start position:0%
wanted i don't want this to be the barn
door

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
door
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
right not married to the idea it just
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
seemed like that was a
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
something useful to put in i agree with
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
i don't detect strong feelings
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
carson fontenot or o'brien do you have
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
any concerns with that
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
i don't have any real concerns with it
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
um as long as it doesn't open that uh
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
the duo back up to the
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
being the description being too vague
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
that the reason we're having this
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's why i said or closely related we
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
have to assume people are reasonable in
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
the way they look at this that the fact
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
that you sold amway goods during summer
 
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
vacation does not qualify okay as a
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
closely related activity
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
a couple more uh
 
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.990 align:start position:0%
a couple more uh
another

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
thing that i'd like to bring up
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
and that is do we want to is there any
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
reason to invoke rules here is there
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
anything that requires uh john carter to
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
look at this like i'm looking when i see
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
it this isn't this is put into their
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay so it's already it's already there
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay so that that takes care of that uh
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i'd like to mention
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
mr broderick are you on board here i

uh
we

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we have the sub company
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
is willing to feed the
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
the the grota words put in with as and
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.150 align:start position:0%
that phrase
and

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
coupled with the grota
 
00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.990 align:start position:0%
coupled with the grota
language

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh we'd like to see
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
actually it's the mcguire language
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative scitec oh
 
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.670 align:start position:0%
representative scitec oh
oh

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.549 align:start position:0%
oh
well

00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
my language my my edition was not
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
accepted by the committee but okay
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative was just able to find the
 
00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.510 align:start position:0%
representative was just able to find the
words

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
go speak mr representative o'brien uh
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um and i'm all in favor of
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
this and i think that the committee has
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
done a fine job giving specific examples
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh but what about putting the uh
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
something else in there we gave the
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
examples but as mentioned
 
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.589 align:start position:0%
examples but as mentioned
other

00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
similar type of responsibilities
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
maintained by the candidate you know and
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
that would be a little bit more
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
conclusive yet it throws the power back
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
to the hiring and the responsibility
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
back to the hiring source
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
so they could jeopardize themselves if
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
pay attention to our examples and
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
everything but it might be a little bit
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's your amendment
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
i think that i i think i used
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
i used my words for your idea
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
all right that's the only two bits i got
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
to it yeah okay sure enough and
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative wrote it when you said
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
your idea wasn't accepted it's kind of
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
harsh uh you're
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
no no it's not harsh i i don't mean to
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
be harsh at all
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
i'm saying i don't want to sound that
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
way the the fact is that you had a good
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
idea which is self-correcting well i
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't no but i wasn't panning your idea
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm saying of course i
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
didn't mean it that way and if you took
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
my words that way i thought it was not
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
my intent and i apologize
 
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.630 align:start position:0%
my intent and i apologize
okay

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.670 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
where we're left with is
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
with those words uh
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
miss smarling if you would craft those
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
together i think our business has done
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the love well
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
i think we should take a vote on
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
recommending this amendment
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
to with the with the revised language to
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
anyway i will so move that we recommend
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
this new sub-paragraph
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
as part 14 of
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
and can i just clarify that we're we're
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
just adding one sentence to the end of
 
00:51:41.839 --> 00:51:42.630 align:start position:0%
just adding one sentence to the end of
the

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:51:44.079 --> 00:51:46.470 align:start position:0%
the amendment
that

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
is about documented life experience but
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
and the only
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
addition is at the end of the sentence
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
it says such as scouts or little league
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
or a closely related activity
 
00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.589 align:start position:0%
or a closely related activity
right

00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
okay yeah okay
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh madam chairman uh through the uh
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
chairman if i may ask a question too
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh this seems
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
to be because of the pandemic and and
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
the difficulty and talking to the good
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
people in nashua
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
it goes many much more uh type of places
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
are looking for help the other day i
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
went to demoulas and the butcher asked
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
me if i wanted a part-time job you know
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
i thought there was a cut up no pun
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
intended but
 
00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.109 align:start position:0%
intended but
however

00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
should this should we contemplate a
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
sunset to this if we see better times or
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
sunsets are usually a problem i
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien if you're here in
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
two years introdu
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh have
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
repealed will repeal the bill because we
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
don't know where we're going
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay now that's a fair answer i just uh
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
wonder if it might be a possibility but
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i happen to like
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
sunsets too but i don't also see a lot
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
of uncertainty out there i'd love
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
also like to see how this works and
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
people are very
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
people don't have hesitate to bring in
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
repeals except for itinerant peddlers
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
other thing that i might mention to you
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien is you're
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
probably you and i are probably the only
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
two people left on the planet that still
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say just throw that in
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
yes and i'd like to comment on that
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
nothing not the market basket experience
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
the shortage of child care workers has
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
been going on a great deal longer than
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
and this is a way to
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
ease people into it without requiring
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
them to take
 
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.270 align:start position:0%
them to take
uh

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
30 hours as a substantial amount of
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
academic qualifications they still have
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
to have some and they need to do the
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
continuing education
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
but this will get people into the
 
00:54:04.319 --> 00:54:05.430 align:start position:0%
but this will get people into the
business

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
and let them start working
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
before they have to make the commitment
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
on the academics and i think that is
 
00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:14.790 align:start position:0%
on the academics and i think that is
important

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
if i'm done i agree madam chair i would
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
like to add to you because i'm sure
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
everyone read the report that miriam
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
sent that
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
just to say that the study committee
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
that looked at the business environment
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
for child care providers
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh that report was written pre-covered
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
and this was among the suggestions of
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
how to
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
um improve
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
the business of child care providing and
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
i think overall it just helps
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
people who need
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh child care in general uh i think the
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
other recommendations were good too
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i think we should look at those and
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
the ones that pertain to our committee
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
but there are still a few that haven't
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
been implemented
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
and yeah this child care crisis predates
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
i think there is a thank you
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
the study on house bill 230
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate place to consider
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
that because we'll have the whole summer
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
just for my own understanding
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
this is more on the job training people
 
00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
get started but they still have to meet
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
all the criteria that exist it's just
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
that we're getting getting them their
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
foot in the door
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
right this allows them to start working
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
prior to getting the 30 hours
 
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.630 align:start position:0%
prior to getting the 30 hours
of

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.670 align:start position:0%
of
training

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
they still have to keep they have to
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
have i believe nine hours to get in the
 
00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.710 align:start position:0%
have i believe nine hours to get in the
war

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
war
 
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.589 align:start position:0%
war
and

00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
they also the persons that we approve by
 
00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.589 align:start position:0%
they also the persons that we approve by
this

00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
still need to maintain
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
all of the continuing education
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%

john williams of the hhs department they
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
have been listening into the column
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
equally in the last half hour
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
and they had several important points to
 
01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.470 align:start position:0%
and they had several important points to
raise

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
raise
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh so it would be very helpful the
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
so if either john williams could be
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
allowed into their concerns and their
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
contribution and what they would like to
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
contribute to the discussions
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is an executive session and i don't
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's not a public hearing
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know about you but i've heard
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
from a lot of people
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is about the subcommittee i see
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
melissa clement has her hand right she's
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
the staffer at hhs
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
she she's one of the people who would
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
certainly be uh like like to speak and
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
the concern that they raised with me in
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
the con conversation i just had with
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
them definitely should be part of our
 
01:04:32.319 --> 01:04:34.470 align:start position:0%
them definitely should be part of our
deliberations

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh when we get to a section where
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
they're relevant we might consider it or
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
you can relay their concerns
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
at the moment we are going to be going
 
01:04:47.119 --> 01:04:48.230 align:start position:0%
at the moment we are going to be going
through

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.750 align:start position:0%
through
uh

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
the plan for today is to do four
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
bills fills 114 42 and 57 which we
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
should be able to completely expect
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
then we are going to start on senate
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
bill 133
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
going section by section except
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
that we're going to do the ones that had
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
unanimous or near unanimous
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommendations first we
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
will save the debates for the end
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
because ms smarling is going to have to
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
stitch together
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
a fairly substantial amendment
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
from all the pieces that get amended
 
01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.390 align:start position:0%
from all the pieces that get amended
so

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative schuett i'll
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
recognize you when i finish
 
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay so the plan is to do like i said
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
these these three bills that we should
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
be able to complete with full
 
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.789 align:start position:0%
be able to complete with full
recommendations

01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
then start in on 133
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
easy stuff first
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
and yes representative schuman please
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%

01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
i apologize madam chair i thought i
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
thought you were
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh ending
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
your summary uh
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
in order to um
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
make something very simple i think
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
happened you had graciously extended
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh a period of time to still consider
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 106 which we actually voted
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
on on april 27th
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
i have had
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent conversations with
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
fire marshal parisi
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
and i am fine with letting that report
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
so we've already voted on it so
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
basically all you have to do is
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
send the paperwork in so thank you very
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
ms simmons and miss smarling take that
 
01:06:53.119 --> 01:06:53.829 align:start position:0%
ms simmons and miss smarling take that
as

01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
as permission to
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
let senate bill 106 proceed we've
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
which was the one that was posted and we
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
need to execute this one
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative you have a motion
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
i do i move that we uh itl uh senate
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
bill 114.
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your emotion
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
i would um
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
so this is the one that i got started
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
out in the senate um
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
related to recreational areas and the
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
title still reflects that
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
however they amended it to remove most
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
of it and it just put some requirements
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
on training for law enforcement in
 
01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.230 align:start position:0%
on training for law enforcement in
general

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
and i believe you uh madam chair and my
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i also went and looked through
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
what's on the standards and training
 
01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.670 align:start position:0%
what's on the standards and training
website

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
and what this bill specifies is
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
basically already part of the training
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
so i don't think there's any uh need for
 
01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.470 align:start position:0%
so i don't think there's any uh need for
this

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
and uh so i think we should just i tell
 
01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
and uh so i think we should just i tell
it

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
do you just speak to yourself no i agree
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
with everything you said okay
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who wishes to discuss
 
01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who wishes to discuss
this

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
i would like oh representatives raised
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
for him senator
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
i have had several discussions about
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
this bill and
unfortunately

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
the description of the bill and the
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
title no longer reflects what
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
the bill was originally intended for
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
although there is training that
 
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.149 align:start position:0%
although there is training that
occurs

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:51.189 align:start position:0%
occurs
um

01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
there this type of training that's being
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
referred to in this
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.709 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
involves

01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
involves
 
01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:02.070 align:start position:0%
involves
um

01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
a more passive
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
and um less
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
confrontational type of approach in
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
these matters that's not specifically
 
01:09:12.159 --> 01:09:13.269 align:start position:0%
these matters that's not specifically
addressed

01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
from my understanding in police training
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
however i do understand that this is in
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
the process of being added through rule
 
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.669 align:start position:0%
the process of being added through rule
making

01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes the deplete it is currently in the
 
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.910 align:start position:0%
yes the deplete it is currently in the
schedule

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the police standards and training
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
council is undergoing rulemaking to
 
01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:38.950 align:start position:0%
council is undergoing rulemaking to
incorporate

01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
this specific training for all law
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in their rules
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to be i just wanted one
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
to understand that the training that is
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
referred to in this bill is not
 
01:09:49.679 --> 01:09:50.870 align:start position:0%
referred to in this bill is not
currently

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the training this is something that
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
would be added in rules
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
it is currently in their schedule and
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
the first lesson starts in august
 
01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.830 align:start position:0%
the first lesson starts in august
thank

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you i saw in if i could
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
make a comment representative
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i looked through what's in
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
standards and training and the language
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's already there
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
you're correct it's not quite the same
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
as what's in the bill
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
but there is um existing you know
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
certain types of diversity training and
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
also um
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
in the use of force
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
training um you know trying to
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
de-escalate situations so there's some
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
training like this but i think uh
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know making it more explicit and
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
cleaning up through rulemaking hopefully
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
please represent brodie
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
yes i'm sorry i'm going to give give my
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
time to representative schultz thank you
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.350 align:start position:0%
madam chair i did have my hand up um
uh

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
i actually helped write the original
 
01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.470 align:start position:0%
i actually helped write the original
bill

01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
and as i understand it
 
01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.149 align:start position:0%
and as i understand it
um

01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns
 
01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.790 align:start position:0%
the concerns
from

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
the bill authors
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
and the original intent of the bill is
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
still something in my opinion that needs
 
01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:09.590 align:start position:0%
still something in my opinion that needs
work

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
i would prefer
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill to go to the original
 
01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.070 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill to go to the original
intent

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
which is simply to make sure
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
that those professions and directly
 
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.950 align:start position:0%
that those professions and directly
under

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
the office of i'm going to get the
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
acronym wrong please forgive me natural
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
reason cultural and natural resources
 
01:11:29.679 --> 01:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
reason cultural and natural resources
um

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
that would be responsible for
 
01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.310 align:start position:0%
that would be responsible for
um

01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.830 align:start position:0%
um
peacekeeping

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
peacekeeping
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
in our state parks that is separate from
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
other law enforcement
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
um not fish and game
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
i believe
um

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think their title is police off
 
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.830 align:start position:0%
i don't think their title is police off
uh

01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
officers or
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
peacekeepers but the original intent of
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
this bill was simply to
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that the governor's
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
leak commission recommendations on
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
training which do
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
include upgrades to the existing
 
01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:13.110 align:start position:0%
include upgrades to the existing
training

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.390 align:start position:0%
training
would

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.270 align:start position:0%
would
be

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
available to the staff
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
that as i understand it aren't currently
 
01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.030 align:start position:0%
that as i understand it aren't currently
included

01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
in this type of training
 
01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.229 align:start position:0%
in this type of training
uh

01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
the senate amendment and the version we
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
got from the senate
 
01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.350 align:start position:0%
got from the senate
um

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
i would support but
 
01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.870 align:start position:0%
i would support but
that

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
negates the original intent of the bill
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
anyway really i mean it's related enough
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be considered a
 
01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.270 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be considered a
non-germane

01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
non-germane
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment per se
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
i was hoping that to make a motion to
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
retain the bill so that we could work on
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that the original intent
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
if it needed to be written into law to
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
include these sorts of trainings for
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
those specific
 
01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.709 align:start position:0%
those specific
positions

01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
to keep the peace
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
other points could be made that
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
law enforcement also
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
can be called to various state parks etc
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's still going to be true no matter
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
but there are some
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
positions under the department of
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
cultural natural resources that would
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
benefit from
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
the police academy specific
 
01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
the police academy specific
de-escalation

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
de-escalation
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
and diversity inclusion trainings that
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
currently do not receive it as i
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.790 align:start position:0%
understand it
um

01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's my points
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i'm afraid that that
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
amending the bill to that would be would
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
be considered non-tremaine since the
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
senate stripped out all reference to
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
anything except
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman um
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
coming from where i came before as uh my
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
time is a couple of times is by share
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
transportation i would agree with
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative leckus something like
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
that was so poorly constructed torn
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
apart by the senate i probably would
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
have came up with an itl recommendation
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
as well too
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
but then again i look at the times that
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
we are living in particularly today
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
and this is a very timely
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
subject that i think is worthy of this
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
committee to spend the time
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
to try to address
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh for what i am led to believe
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
that the governor is looking at this
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
also and with the governor looking at
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
this i think the governor would be a
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
fine partner of this particular
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
committee to take this timely subject
 
01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:57.189 align:start position:0%
committee to take this timely subject
and

01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
i think we would do the public good to
 
01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.630 align:start position:0%
i think we would do the public good to
uh

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
retain it and try to work on it if after
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
the end of retaining is we cannot come
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
to a consensus or an agreement with the
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
senate i think we all know what's going
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
to happen next but that doesn't stop us
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
from our responsibility of giving a good
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
college try on this
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
so therefore again uh regrettably i'm
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
going to go against the grain of my own
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
personal old uh
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
vice chairman status of itl in this but
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think again it's timely and prudent
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
and it needs work and i'm willing to
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
retain the bill thank you madam chair
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
i have a few brief comments uh first
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
comment being i'm a little disappointed
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
that ols didn't do their homework when
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
they printed the amended analysis
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
because that title does not fit what the
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
second i would like to make the comment
 
01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.189 align:start position:0%
second i would like to make the comment
that

01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
i agree if this is already being worked
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
on and placed into rules um
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
that it is probably not a bad thing to
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
my concern with
 
01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
my concern with
edna

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
edna
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
retaining this into our committee
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
i truly believe that
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
the work on this bill should be done in
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and public safety
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
committee i truly believe this is where
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
should be placed in wedles language
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
belongs uh for review
 
01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:37.990 align:start position:0%
belongs uh for review
um

01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see retaining
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
a bill with this language in it to work
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
on something that's non-germane
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
if we it'll this uh the sponsors are
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
still able to bring back what they
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
really wanted in place again next year
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
where it can be worked on and hopefully
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
be sent to the proper committee
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
so i would just ask that the committee
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
think about that when voting thank you
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's only marginally related to edna
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
and as it was originally written it was
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i understand uh
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien's uh
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
concerns about continuing to work on it
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
but i agree with representative goalie
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing is i don't know what the
 
01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
timing is going to be on
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
the rule making being complete and going
 
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
through jellicar and how that would line
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
up with
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know by the time that's done would
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
there be time for the committee to work
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
on it as a retained bill so
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree i'd suggest letting that go
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
forward and if um
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know people aren't satisfied with
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
what they do then a new bill could be
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
brought in and i agree it should people
 
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
should go to criminal justice in that
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
case thank you
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
my only concern is if we do itl this
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh then we're basically ruling out using
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
this language
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
or something
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
very much like it uh in a new bill next
 
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.510 align:start position:0%
very much like it uh in a new bill next
year

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
if it's discovered by administrative
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
rules that
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh rsa is needed
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
so i'll put that forward
 
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.350 align:start position:0%
so i'll put that forward
[Music]

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
a valid point but i would say that since
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
the title is no longer relevant
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the concerns are related to issues
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
other than what police standards and
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
training does
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
any new bill would not be
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
you think just because the fact that the
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
title is inconsistent that
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
that would allow the language of the
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
actual bill to be able to go forward
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
well the
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
i think that it was the sections that
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
the senate took out that need
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
consideration not what's in the police
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
standards and training so much
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
if there's a question about a bill being
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
identical i'll certainly support
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
bringing it in because this is not what
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
was written in running for sure thank
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
you yes i i certainly agree that
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
the title and the amended analysis do
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
not agree with the language that's
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
currently there like i said my my
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
concern is that we put are putting that
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
language for police standards and
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
training in jeopardy if we kill this
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that would be the case
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you speaker's office anyways yes
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
we will make sure to mention that
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative fellows
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um having worked
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
for the state for 30 years i know that
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
situations can develop in
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
any any state agency people people can
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
walk into an agency and they're having a
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
mental crisis or they're just angry
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
about something
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:20:02.719 --> 01:20:03.510 align:start position:0%
and that
maybe

01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
it might be
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
all state employees or state employees
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
from many different agencies could
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
benefit from
 
01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.189 align:start position:0%
benefit from
de-escalation

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
de-escalation
 
01:20:19.199 --> 01:20:19.930 align:start position:0%
de-escalation
and

01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:19.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.030 align:start position:0%

techniques for dealing with people that
 
01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
techniques for dealing with people that
are

01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
just being difficult or having a mental
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
crisis and so
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think this is
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
an important area of concern
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
but that kind of training um
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
and to get it to everybody who could
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
benefit from it from it doesn't isn't
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
really an
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
issue that me needs to be in statute it
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
needs to be it could be in rules but
 
01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
needs to be it could be in rules but
maybe

01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's just more important to talk to
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
the governor about
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
funding that kind of training and making
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
it available to many state workers
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%

i can't raise my hand
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i just wanted
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
to address uh representative schuett's
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about this language uh if we
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
itl at coming back
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
this language passed the senate so it
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
could come back through the senate side
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think the uh
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the of this bill and this
 
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
intent of the of this bill and this
language

01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
is uh based on the governor's um
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
council lilliac commission and i think
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
what representative schultz was
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
referring to are there are
 
01:21:44.719 --> 01:21:45.669 align:start position:0%
referring to are there are
um

01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
employees within the
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
um recreation and natural resource and
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
recreation commission commission
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
that fall under this
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's meant to cover these individuals
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
that are not part of the
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
police academy police
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
training now
 
01:22:08.639 --> 01:22:09.430 align:start position:0%
training now
so

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
there are a few individuals in that
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
service in that commission in that
 
01:22:15.679 --> 01:22:17.030 align:start position:0%
service in that commission in that
commission

01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
that are better city employees and i
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
think the intent was to include them
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
and also to make sure as i said earlier
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
training that
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
the police academy
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
gives although includes
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
some of this training now makes the
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
training more specific
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
and since i believe all this is going to
 
01:22:40.719 --> 01:22:42.070 align:start position:0%
and since i believe all this is going to
be

01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
part of rules
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
as you confirmed
 
01:22:46.239 --> 01:22:48.149 align:start position:0%
as you confirmed
um

01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
i will support either motion that the
 
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee makes to either retain or itl
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
i think that it's covered in rules it
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
will be
done

01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
we'll just make sure it's going to be
 
01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.669 align:start position:0%
we'll just make sure it's going to be
done

01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
i will mention that the people like park
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
rangers and so forth are in fact
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
considered law enforcement
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
and they do go to the police standards
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
and training
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative roy
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sharon
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
um a couple quick points um to
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative fellows i think that was
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
a that's a good idea but it's a i think
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's more of an human resources
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
issue versus the de-escalation training
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement which is um very
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
specific and involves use of force and
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
things like that so it's a
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
matter but um i believe that this
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
rather than memorializing this
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
in statute this is definitely something
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
more for rules
 
01:23:42.639 --> 01:23:43.510 align:start position:0%
more for rules
um

01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
the rules are meant to be changed and
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
adjusted as times change and techniques
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
change and necessarily um
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily in um
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
in statute for all time to be changed
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
and changed again so i i think that the
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
proper route is tight elvis
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
let the rule making process go forward
 
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
and should that not be adequate then we
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
can revisit a legislative solution but
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
right now i think we should just go with
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
the natural course which would be the
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
rule making thank you
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to speak on
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
all right i don't see any hands
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%

that the topic that was deleted by the

senate and so was no longer relevant to
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
should be considered by the
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%

01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
one thing i wanted to bring to the
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee is that the senate amendment
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%

01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
this guy chesmar i think he needs more
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%

01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
topic for another day well as i told
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative cahill when he was
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
talking emailing me about it
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
thoroughly study
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
to put it in context
 
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 42 was aimed at expanding
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh protections against conflict of
 
01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.790 align:start position:0%
uh protections against conflict of
interest

01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
and it spoke in
 
01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:00.229 align:start position:0%
and it spoke in
rsa

01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
95 uh colon one it extended that to
 
01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.070 align:start position:0%
95 uh colon one it extended that to
services

01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh and my recollection is that this
 
01:31:08.159 --> 01:31:09.189 align:start position:0%
uh and my recollection is that this
committee

01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh there was little disagreement about
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
whether that was needed
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
but there was question about the levels
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
of um the dollar levels that were
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
discussed or that were in the in the
 
01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:20.709 align:start position:0%
discussed or that were in the in the
bill

01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:31:20.719 --> 01:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
the last time it was changed was back in
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
the 1970s the levels were 200 for both
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
goods and services
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
so this amendment raises those levels
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
back to the 70s the the dollar level was
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
200 goods
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
200 in services was added later
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
and this amendment uh specifies for
 
01:31:44.159 --> 01:31:45.270 align:start position:0%
and this amendment uh specifies for
services

01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
a term of one year
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
and raises the level of each goods and
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
services from two hundred to one
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
check our towns to see what their policy
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
was and salem has no policy apart from
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
the rsa
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%

maybe someone could point me in the
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
right direction is public official
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
defined somewhere else in the statute i
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's defined as a person holding a
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
public office
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
and yes this is
 
01:32:46.229 --> 01:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh in 95 colon one which is the
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
deals with public officers and employees
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
so a public office would be an elected
 
01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:55.290 align:start position:0%
official versus an employed official
 
01:32:55.290 --> 01:32:56.629 align:start position:0%
official versus an employed official

01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:56.639 --> 01:32:57.669 align:start position:0%
[Music]
yes

01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
so this bill did not include
 
01:33:00.159 --> 01:33:01.750 align:start position:0%
so this bill did not include
employees

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
my selectmen as well
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
and she told me that well they don't
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
really have a policy but they try to
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
keep it open and go off for
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
out for bid on anything that involves
 
01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.550 align:start position:0%
out for bid on anything that involves
the

01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
selectmen or other official elected
 
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
selectmen or other official elected
officials

01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
officials
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
so i think having a little more clarity
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
all right representative fellows
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i collected
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
information about two towns in my area
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
they both have about 2 000 people in
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
their population and both of them
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
do what they do is they have a
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
set limit below which the department
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
supervisor can
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
make his own decisions and one of the
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
limits was twenty five thousand dollars
 
01:34:07.199 --> 01:34:08.229 align:start position:0%
limits was twenty five thousand dollars
so

01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:08.239 --> 01:34:09.110 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
in both cases they really weren't paying
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
any attention to this
 
01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.270 align:start position:0%
any attention to this
statute

01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
and neither of them had any sort of
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
policy to deal with this either i
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion is that
 
01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.870 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion is that
the

01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:25.709 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:34:25.709 --> 01:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities or the entity
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
should have a policy that is made public
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
but that's not for us to deal with that
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
would be something i think it's mostly
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
an issue for for municipalities and
 
01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.830 align:start position:0%
an issue for for municipalities and
really

01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.350 align:start position:0%
really
um

01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.870 align:start position:0%
um
somebody

01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's it's not for our committee that
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
would be for county and municipal to
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
so i support the amendment because it
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
makes it better than it is it just
 
01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.669 align:start position:0%
makes it better than it is it just
doesn't

01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't um
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
still doesn't address the problem
 
01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.870 align:start position:0%
still doesn't address the problem
okay

01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
i had a question in response to your
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
call for questions
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
so the public official question
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
represented roy raised so i'm
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh the police chief uh the fire chief
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh the town manager and so forth uh city
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
manager those
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
are they
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
i think those are public officials but
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
they are also town employees of city
 
01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.030 align:start position:0%
they are also town employees of city
employees

01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:36.790 align:start position:0%
employees
um

01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
but in most cases anyway they are not
 
01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:40.070 align:start position:0%
but in most cases anyway they are not
elective

01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
elective
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and so um does that fit into the
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i think so rsa 95 talks about um
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
public officials barred from insurance
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
title six which is public officers and
 
01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:20.629 align:start position:0%
title six which is public officers and
employees

01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
just for reflection
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative roy you had another
 
01:36:36.239 --> 01:36:37.750 align:start position:0%
representative roy you had another
comment

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes um yeah i just wanted to piggyback
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
on that again i am concerned that it
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't address employees because some
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
big decision makers who would uh make
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
decisions on contracts and things of
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
this nature aren't necessarily elected
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
and um last term i had brought forth the
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
bill because i discovered that
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh many towns were were doing a
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
contracts with heat
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
heating oil and propane suppliers
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
whereby if the
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
town agreed to their bid they would give
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
10 percent off to all town employees on
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
their home heating oil
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
which is so unethical um
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if this is going to do
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
anything to address that but i i really
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
think that if we have the opportunity we
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
should we should make this as tight as
 
01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.189 align:start position:0%
should we should make this as tight as
possible

01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
one one comment if i may on that yes
 
01:37:28.639 --> 01:37:29.990 align:start position:0%
one one comment if i may on that yes
representative

01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah we heard that bill last year in
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
minnesota county and that's actually the
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee it would belong in i think
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
rather than ours i don't remember now
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened to it but uh
 
01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.229 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened to it but uh
um

01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know but would it i agree that it's
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
an issue the heating oil when i heard
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
that was ridiculous but uh it wouldn't
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
be for our committee i don't think
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
yes and i will i will mention that after
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
i was tasked with invest talking to
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
municipal and county
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
and the chair and the vice chair both
 
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.669 align:start position:0%
and the chair and the vice chair both
said

01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's no problem with senate bill 42
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it addresses a real concern so
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
i i'm going to support the uh solution
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
with amendments
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
of course yes thank you any other

his uh camera on and that makes his vote
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
questionable under our rules so if you
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%

i do thank you um
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that permitted uh
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technicians to um
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
remotely do certain administrative type
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
operations related to uh
 
01:42:40.239 --> 01:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
operations related to uh
um

01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
to handling uh prescriptions
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the you know we heard from the
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative from pillpack which is
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh has been doing that for a while under
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
the uh emergency orders and it just
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
expands it so pharmacy technicians can
 
01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:56.709 align:start position:0%
expands it so pharmacy technicians can
do

01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
what are essentially administrative work
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i don't see any reason why they
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to do that they're
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of licensed
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacists and um
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
they don't actually handle the drugs
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
themselves doing this so um i think we
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
should uh
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
vote this ought to pass and uh
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
and make it easier for businesses to
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
provide people with their meds at a
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%

01:43:20.719 --> 01:43:21.830 align:start position:0%

and we will be going through
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
section by section to develop an
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that is no doubt going to be
 
01:45:37.679 --> 01:45:41.590 align:start position:0%
amendment that is no doubt going to be
needed

01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry madam chair are you asking us
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
to vote on the entire bill
 
01:45:45.679 --> 01:45:46.950 align:start position:0%
to vote on the entire bill
no

01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
no we're going to be vote
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
you have to have an ought to pass motion
 
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
in order to consider amendments and i am
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
making that notion
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
i i just have a question i maybe i
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstood i thought we were going to
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
take up 106.
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
we've already done one of six we i was
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
just holding on to it and not moving it
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
forward but we voted oh
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay sorry
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
no biggie
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'll second
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
can i just ask a question how
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
logistically i don't understand how this
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
works if we vote
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
to um let's say we vote ought to pass on
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 133 then how is it that our
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
amendments are going to be considered or
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
are we going to have this as part of the
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
discussion well okay we are going to
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
consider each section separately
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
and take
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
what is probably a straw poll but a vote
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
of the full committee on each section
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
whether to i t or to pass in which case
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
we'll leave it in the bill
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment in which
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
case we will have the words we want even
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
if we it is not an official amendment
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
or itl in which case we will remove it
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
for 133
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
we will get as far into the bill as we
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
can today
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
smarling will be stitching all the
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
pieces together to make a complete
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
amendment if we get through every
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
section then we will have a final
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that we will be able to vote
 
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.109 align:start position:0%
amendment that we will be able to vote
on

01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:47:17.119 --> 01:47:18.149 align:start position:0%
on
next

01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
time we meet
 
01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.350 align:start position:0%
time we meet
and

01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh but we will not vote on the entire
 
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.629 align:start position:0%
uh but we will not vote on the entire
bill

01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
today because we don't have a finished
 
01:47:27.119 --> 01:47:30.310 align:start position:0%
today because we don't have a finished
amendment

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
is that clear
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
he is
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm new to this but is this
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
is this standard procedure
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
no standard procedure have you have one
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
topic on a bill right we don't do
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
omnibus we don't do omnibus very often
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's similar to what the finance
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
committee does on house bill 2.
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
but no it's not standard procedure we're
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
working it out as we go because we
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
normally do not get
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
on the buses of this extent
 
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.430 align:start position:0%
on the buses of this extent
okay

01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
there we go representative schuett thank
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um may i request um
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
a five minute turn break before we start
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
on this i assume it will take a little
 
01:48:13.199 --> 01:48:15.910 align:start position:0%
on this i assume it will take a little
while

01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
sure we will resume at 11 30
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i intend to take a lunch break
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
because i have a meeting with the
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
speaker at 12 30 so we will break from
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
12 30 to 1 30.
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
i expect the first few sections we take
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
up will be the ones that had unanimous
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations in some committee
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
just uh briefly um because maybe with
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
your meeting with the speaker unless you
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
already have an answer this could be
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
addressed as to
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
majority and minority reports on this
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill where there's 13 parts there could
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
be numerous minority reports on
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
different sections
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering how they're going to
 
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:00.820 align:start position:0%
address that in the calendar and
 
01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:02.470 align:start position:0%
address that in the calendar and
[Music]

01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'll bring it up but without
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
any recommendation i would say there
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be one minority report
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
which would for example
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
which would have a different amendment
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
addressing different segments which
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh i'll conf i'll confirm that but i
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
think there's only one minority report
 
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.229 align:start position:0%
think there's only one minority report
allowed

01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay because it i mean there's 13
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
sections of this bill there could be
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
three different sections that three
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
individuals are opposed to
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
um who would want a minority report just
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
on that section and that's just my
 
01:49:39.119 --> 01:49:40.310 align:start position:0%
on that section and that's just my
concern

01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
well i'll manage the minority reports
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
from the republicans you can manage the
 
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
minority from the democrats okay
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative roy you have a comment
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
just to be clear today is kind of uh
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
hybrid it's a it's a
 
01:49:59.590 --> 01:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
work session slash executive
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i i i need to we're not going to
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
take any official votes today as we have
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
no official amendments
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct because um i have to i
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
have to bug out about quarter of two to
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
pick up my son for his driver's test
 
01:50:14.719 --> 01:50:15.669 align:start position:0%
pick up my son for his driver's test
today

01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
well i certainly hope that uh we will be
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
be through with all the important
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
controversial amendments by then but
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
one never knows
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
and i apologize but it was scheduled
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago so
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's fine we'll do what we can
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%

um

02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
that's right i make a motion to itl part
 
02:07:26.079 --> 02:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
that's right i make a motion to itl part
four

02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your motion
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
oh sure
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
this seems to um
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
restrict the composition of the board of
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
the school board and
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh more importantly in the other part of
 
02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:48.310 align:start position:0%
uh more importantly in the other part of
it

02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh what they're trying to do is to lift
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
the term limits because previously
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
only two full terms could be served but
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
now they're changing it to two
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
consecutive terms and they don't see
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
that we should do that
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
all right does anyone else wish to speak
 
02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:07.510 align:start position:0%
all right does anyone else wish to speak
to

02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative phillips
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
i worked at the department of education
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
so i know
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
i never worked with this particular
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
board but i know about it and
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
well the changes seem reasonable
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
but i think we didn't
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
really find out why they want to do them
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
and i totally understand the part about
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
consecutive you know to to because that
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
opens it up for somebody to serve two
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
consecutive terms
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
take a
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
part of the you know a few years off and
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
come back again that makes sense to me i
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
don't particularly know why
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
they want to specify how many
 
02:08:55.109 --> 02:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
um representatives from higher education
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
and how many from k-12
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
and i sent an email to
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
staff person
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
for the two sponsors in the senate
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
and asking for some more information and
 
02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear anything back you know i
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
don't i don't know
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
if they don't have anything to add or
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
maybe they are just too
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
busy you know because it hasn't it's
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
only been a few working days so i don't
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
i really don't have any opinion one way
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
or the other
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
representative allegra i would just add
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
to that that's a good point but
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if they're not responsive
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's anything we can do
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%

question of the chair yes
 
02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:35.030 align:start position:0%
question of the chair yes
so

02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
so representative uh
 
02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:39.589 align:start position:0%
so representative uh
is

02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to vote by
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
um that would be unless her phone has a
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
camera which for example representative
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
does he's on and representative sanchez
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
so if she
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
she calls in on the phone where the
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
camera will be delighted to have her
 
02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:03.109 align:start position:0%
camera will be delighted to have her
vote

02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
as these are unofficial votes um as a
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
straw poll should it matter or am i off
 
02:12:14.079 --> 02:12:17.030 align:start position:0%
straw poll should it matter or am i off
base

02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
as a matter of protocol i think we
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
should ask that she
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
she uh
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
gives a give us her photo but she's
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
still not there so it doesn't matter on
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
what was the vote
 
02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
seven eleven to seven
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
all right well that one was surprisingly
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:45.119 --> 02:12:53.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:12:53.189 --> 02:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:56.960 align:start position:0%

okay

02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%

i do thank you please
 
02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
let's do them let's talk about the
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.599 --> 02:13:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:13:38.069 --> 02:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment was sent to us
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
after hearing the bill the subcommittee
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
had concerns about
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
the cost of the membership in the um
 
02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:46.310 align:start position:0%
the cost of the membership in the um
compact

02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
compact
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
and that it didn't somehow trickle ball
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
to the general fund so
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
oplc agreed to language that they
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
submitted to us
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
that would put them on the hook for any
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
expenses incurred by the compact and the
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee agreed with that
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
there's also going to need to be an
 
02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:04.149 align:start position:0%
there's also going to need to be an
amendment

02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
for a drafting error
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
where we decide which section of the law
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
that this goes into oplc
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
would like it to be in the in the speech
 
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
pathology section of the law
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
versus into a general section on
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
compacts i tended to agree instead of
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
but we leave that to the whole committee
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
to decide because that's kind of a
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
policy issue going forward with these
 
02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:32.550 align:start position:0%
policy issue going forward with these
contacts

02:14:32.550 --> 02:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
yes he said it very well and i'll just
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
add that um
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
i do think it made sense the way that
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from oplc
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
explained it is
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
that people in the various professions
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
are used to looking at the section of
 
02:14:52.149 --> 02:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
the licensing
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
or certification laws that pertain to
 
02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:55.270 align:start position:0%
or certification laws that pertain to
their

02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:56.390 align:start position:0%
their
career

02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
career
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
and their license or certification
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
particularly and so
 
02:15:01.119 --> 02:15:02.870 align:start position:0%
particularly and so
um

02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
that makes sense then to
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
keep it in the audiology and speech
 
02:15:08.079 --> 02:15:10.229 align:start position:0%
keep it in the audiology and speech
pathology

02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
pathology
 
02:15:10.239 --> 02:15:11.510 align:start position:0%
pathology
section

02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:15:15.189 --> 02:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
of the law and that sounds like a good
 
02:15:15.199 --> 02:15:16.069 align:start position:0%
of the law and that sounds like a good
point

02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
and maybe that then needs to be added to
 
02:15:18.719 --> 02:15:19.589 align:start position:0%
and maybe that then needs to be added to
other

02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:15:19.599 --> 02:15:23.669 align:start position:0%
other
professions

02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and i i would like to say that
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
i agree with that point that the
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
fact of the compact belongs in or
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
immediately adjacent to the practice act
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
for the profession because
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's where it's going to be
 
02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:44.470 align:start position:0%
that's where it's going to be
relevant

02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
we do not have an official amendment we
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i have some uh
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
language that
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to bring
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
forward for this
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
for part five
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:16:10.159 --> 02:16:13.109 align:start position:0%
as well
okay

02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's um on
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
part five eight b one and i'll read it
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
to you so you don't have to look it up
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is quite simple uh it talks about
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
each member state shall have two
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
delegates selected by the member state
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
licensing board the delegates shall be
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
current members of the licensing board
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
one shall be an audiologist and one
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
shall be a speech language pathologist
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
um a concern that was brought forward
 
02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:35.750 align:start position:0%
um a concern that was brought forward
from

02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
that commission from the chairman of
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
that commission was that they're
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
they have a hard time finding folks so
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
his his request was just to add the
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
sentence if there be no one from the
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
state licensing board who can fill
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
either or both positions the board may
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
select as needed a new hampshire
 
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
licensed audiologist or speech language
 
02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
pathologist to represent it
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
and that was that was just due to the
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
fact that they're having a hard time
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
finding folks to fill positions so it
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't really there's no change of
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
intent in any way it just gives them a
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
of an ability to
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
to go beyond the rigidness of the
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
requirement if they can find no one to
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
fill it
 
02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:25.910 align:start position:0%
fill it
okay

02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and um
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
i just still have
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh some issues with these compacts as
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
they're going forward and as we continue
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
to increase our participation in them
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
and how it affects
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
licensing fees here in the state of new
 
02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:44.549 align:start position:0%
licensing fees here in the state of new
hampshire

02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
more people involved into these compacts
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
and moving around from state to state
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how it's going to affect
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh the revenue raised uh
 
02:18:00.790 --> 02:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
by oplc uh as there are out-of-state
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
licensees participating uh in the new
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire workforce
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
um and that is my concern i
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
understand uh representative royce
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
movement with an amendment
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
saying oplc will
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
absorb the costs
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
but those costs will also be absorbed by
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire licensees for those folks
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
in the compact i would really like to
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
see it as those who are participants in
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
the compact pay a little extra towards
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
the fees to cover
 
02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:31.830 align:start position:0%
the fees to cover
um

02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
that added expense uh going forward um
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
and like i said i'm
 
02:18:39.509 --> 02:18:39.519 align:start position:0%
still a little lenient on jumping in
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
feet first into these compacts without
 
02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
seeing the ramifications further on down
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
the line we've heard
 
02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
board of nursing already adding uh in
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
the nursing compact adding staff and i
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
think this is just going to grow on
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
compacts as states more states get
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
involved and it's going to be a
 
02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
bigger expense to
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
these boards
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schultz
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%

oh i didn't have my hand up but um

02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
i have an opinion anyways but go ahead
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
did you mean
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes i saw the hands of representative
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
schuett and roy
 
02:19:21.359 --> 02:19:22.150 align:start position:0%
schuett and roy
but

02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:23.589 align:start position:0%
but
um

02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
roxanne pearson jumped me got in ahead
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
of representative schultz who made the
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
second so i was pulling on her first
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
oh thank you um that's okay
 
02:19:36.309 --> 02:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
i do agree with uh putting the bulk of
 
02:19:44.639 --> 02:19:45.990 align:start position:0%
i do agree with uh putting the bulk of
the

02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
compact material in with the specific
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
profession but i'm wondering if there
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
a cross-reference to it in
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
a compact section of rsas
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
or perhaps
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
just a spot on the opc
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
website that lists
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
the various professions that are
 
02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
enclosed in compacts
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:26.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
i believe that that
 
02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
the each board each profession each
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
board has their own
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
page on the oplc website
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
and the ones that i've seen with
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
um for example we were looking at
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
four examples of compacts and so forth
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
um you have to look at each of the 55
 
02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
boards to see if they are in fact in
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
compacts and i was thinking
 
02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
like i said perhaps just a simple
 
02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
listing of
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
those professions that are involved in
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
compacts it could possibly influence
 
02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:10.950 align:start position:0%
compacts it could possibly influence
someone

02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
someone
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
if they are someone who
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
travels between states
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh involved in a profession to see if if
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
the profession that they
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
are active in is involved in a compact
 
02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:25.770 align:start position:0%
are active in is involved in a compact

02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
if you're traveling between states
 
02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
in any particular profession you're
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to look up that profession
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
the only people that will be helped by
 
02:21:39.910 --> 02:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
looking at a list of professions of
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
contacts is us
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
because everybody else is going to go
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
profession by profession
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know the the audiologists don't care
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
if the nurses have a contact because it
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
well all right my thought was that for
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
craft these so that they are similar
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
well like i said it would certainly help
 
02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:14.950 align:start position:0%
well like i said it would certainly help
us

02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
but i can't see that it would help most
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
most other people
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam jim um
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
just a couple quick points um with
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
regard to first representative pearson's
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
suggested language um
 
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm only concerned because it wasn't
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
brought to the subcommittee so we didn't
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
really get a chance to hear that or hear
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
if it would in any way impact
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
the compact i know the language has to
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
be very specific as dictated by the
 
02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the compact so i would just
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that didn't run
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
afoul of that anyway and if if it
 
02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't then i'm fine with it um
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
secondly to representative goalie's
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
point um
 
02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the cost we heard testimony
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i can't point you if it's in the
 
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
statute or in the rules and or the rules
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
of the compact itself but a fee is
 
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
assessed to any out of state
 
02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
person who applies for a license under
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
the compact
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
so that the oplc does get revenue from
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
out of state people
 
02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:16.309 align:start position:0%
out of state people
um

02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
to cover what they would have got if it
 
02:23:18.399 --> 02:23:19.670 align:start position:0%
to cover what they would have got if it
was

02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
if if they were handling as for example
 
02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:30.710 align:start position:0%

representative

02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i
 
02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the uh response from
 
02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative roy but i believe when i
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
had asked that question uh i
 
02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
it was explained there was something
 
02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
they could possibly do
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
that they weren't doing it uh for all
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
these all these boards
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's my concern
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
and my concern is how do you track who's
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
coming in state uh on a compact license
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
and who's not i'm not sure they can
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
really do that and i'd like to hear more
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
from oklc on that thank you all right
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
that is a reasonable question
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
if no one on the committee objects i
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
will ask mr broderick
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
from the oplc to address this concern
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
and i should say representative roda is
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
with us with photo
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
mr broderick are you can you speak to us
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
i i am yes and thank you um
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'd have to
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
pull up each one these two compacts
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
allow the old plc or allow the boards to
 
02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:39.270 align:start position:0%
allow the old plc or allow the boards to
assess

02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
assess
 
02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:40.550 align:start position:0%
assess
um

02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
for out of state like someone coming in
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
from out of state that's there on a
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
compact privilege we can just give them
 
02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
a fee it doesn't say
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh it isn't automatic we will need to
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
come up with rules uh
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
for that fee so for these two contacts
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
recoup that cost
 
02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:00.469 align:start position:0%
recoup that cost
um

02:25:00.469 --> 02:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
i you know i'd have to find the exact
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
spot in there if you want that but i i
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
know that exists in these two the pt we
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
already belong to the physical therapy
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
board compact that has that same
 
02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
provision and i believe we're charging a
 
02:25:14.870 --> 02:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
for the privilege to practice here in
 
02:25:18.150 --> 02:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so i
 
02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
we're recouping money
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
from them um
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
the other compacts i would have to check
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
i think one or two of the earlier
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
compacts that the state has already
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
joined um
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
there was not a provision for that um
 
02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:34.950 align:start position:0%
there was not a provision for that um
uh

02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:37.349 --> 02:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
but i i would have to double check that
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
and i just got a message i misspoke it
 
02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't it's not a hundred dollars we're
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
charging 65 dollars for the privileged
 
02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:44.469 align:start position:0%
charging 65 dollars for the privileged
practice

02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i believe the price for a license
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
for physical therapist
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
is 110 for two years
 
02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.630 align:start position:0%
is 110 for two years
correct

02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you venom chair and just a
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
question for mr broderick is to
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
how they track
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
these individuals i know under the
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
nursing compact we have travel nurses
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
coming through this state
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
taking jobs for three months four months
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
six months are they
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
required to register with the board um
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
so that they know that they're here or
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
are they just coming in working and then
 
02:26:29.359 --> 02:26:32.309 align:start position:0%
are they just coming in working and then
leaving

02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
um that the nursing compact uh works a
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
little bit differently than than these
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
two compacts in front of you now um
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm not super well versed in it but
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think that the nursing compact is a
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
if they
 
02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
if they're in another state and they get
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
a compact license they can then go to
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
any state i'm not sure for nursing
 
02:26:58.469 --> 02:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
whether we get notified whether they
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
come into the state or not or this these
 
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
two compacts in front of you now
 
02:27:06.389 --> 02:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
um they do so to work in new hampshire
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
you need a privilege to practice in new
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
so we will have a list of everyone who's
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
working in new hampshire under these two
 
02:27:16.319 --> 02:27:18.950 align:start position:0%
working in new hampshire under these two
contacts

02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:19.990 --> 02:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
was the
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
nursing compact originally structured
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
like these ones are currently my concern
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
is that these compacts could go the same
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
way as the nursing one and we lose track
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
of these folks
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe so i um i think the
 
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
nursing compact was already always
 
02:27:45.830 --> 02:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
drafted that way i think it was one of
 
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
the first it was that
 
02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
i think it was the first contact the
 
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing compact new
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire joined um
 
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire joined um
and

02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:56.230 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
it has not i don't believe it's been
 
02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:00.230 align:start position:0%
it has not i don't believe it's been
amended

02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
amended
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
um in that manner
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
for it to be changed it would the the
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
statute would have had to have been
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
amended so it would have come through
 
02:28:08.469 --> 02:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
your committee um
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
i believe it was only amended once i'd
 
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i i was told that these
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
contacts are based on the physical
 
02:28:19.439 --> 02:28:21.190 align:start position:0%
contacts are based on the physical
therapy

02:28:21.190 --> 02:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
contact which is
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:31.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:28:31.590 --> 02:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
02:28:35.429 --> 02:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard or i heard in one
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
of the other subcommittees was that with
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
regard to the nurses they they don't
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
just kind of parachute into the state
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
and work and leave they have to practice
 
02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:45.910 align:start position:0%
and work and leave they have to practice
underneath

02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
underneath
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
a hospital or a licensee
 
02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
organization in order to practice
 
02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:52.150 align:start position:0%
organization in order to practice
and

02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
in order for them to do that they have
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
to get a compact license so that i
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
believe they are tracked um and because
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
they can't practice on their own with a
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
compact license they have to be i guess
 
02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
sponsored with the word they can't walk
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
work on their own they have to work
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
underneath a higher licensee
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
so that's that's how that's tracked i
 
02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
believe um and as they said this one's
 
02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
totally different anyway because it's
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a comment question
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr broderick for that
 
02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:31.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr broderick for that
information

02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
madam chairman can i just ask if
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative pearson has his language
 
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
in writing that he could provide to me
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
or to that i believe
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's from
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
the chair of hhs
 
02:29:44.399 --> 02:29:45.270 align:start position:0%
the chair of hhs
and

02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
he sent it to me as well and i forwarded
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
it to the entire committee
 
02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:50.710 align:start position:0%
it to the entire committee
so

02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:53.270 --> 02:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
it may be easier if he forwards it again
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
i would love to send it to you pam thank
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
you okay excellent
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to
 
02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
have a short discussion on the question
 
02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
of whether the language belongs
 
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:30:09.270 --> 02:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
practice act for these professions or in
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
a separate section
 
02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:13.030 align:start position:0%
a separate section
and

02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:14.389 --> 02:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
i will
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
recommend that we go with putting it
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
into the practice act and i'd like to
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
hear any opportunity concerns or
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes i'm just wondering if you could
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
explain what that means
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
this was founded a typo adopting the
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
compact was put in two separate places
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
one into a new statute
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
and one into the
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
current statute that defines what
 
02:30:49.270 --> 02:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
audiologists and hearing care and speech
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
language pathologists
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
do in their regulation
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
so that we would want to remove one or
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
the other of them
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
he said they are duplicates and the
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
question is which one
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm suggesting that we remove it
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:19.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:31:21.429 --> 02:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
i think that makes sense the concern of
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
course is you know for someone that's
 
02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:24.389 align:start position:0%
course is you know for someone that's
not

02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with new hampshire necessarily
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
coming in it would make sense to keep
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
things all together
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to send them on a
 
02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
choose your own adventure book here to
 
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
try to figure out everything that
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing this really
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
all together so that it makes sense to
 
02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
to keep it together
 
02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
and and not
 
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
have them try to navigate navigate the
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
rsas to just to simply figure out what
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
they need to do to work so yes
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
all right then we are
 
02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
so then the
 
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
the question of the
 
02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:08.630 align:start position:0%
the question of the
uh

02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
amendment brought in by representative
 
02:32:10.319 --> 02:32:12.630 align:start position:0%
amendment brought in by representative
pearson

02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
pearson
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
is that actually an amendment to the
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
compact itself or is it the statutes
 
02:32:19.990 --> 02:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
around the compact
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i'm not i'm not
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
entirely sure but here's my concern with
 
02:32:26.309 --> 02:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
this and this is a concern that i i'm
 
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
overall not a big fan of compacts but
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
and here's an example as to as to why
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
without this you know if the states
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
if the state's board for audiologists
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
can't or can't find anybody
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
willing to do this
 
02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
we now are in a compact where we have a
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
seat at the table and there's no one in
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
the seat
 
02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:48.309 align:start position:0%
the seat
so

02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's a
 
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's even you know depending on your
 
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
opinion of of the control that you give
 
02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
up in a compact
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
now having a seat that's empty
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
further makes that worse now you're at
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
the whim of something you're not even
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
part of so so all this does is it gives
 
02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:04.790 align:start position:0%
part of so so all this does is it gives
them

02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
the ability to fill this to fill the
 
02:33:09.670 --> 02:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
chair if they can't find somebody
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's all that does and without that
 
02:33:14.230 --> 02:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know this this was brought forward
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
by health and human services because
 
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
they have a legitimate problem filling
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
filling things in this world this is a
 
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
relatively small
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
community so
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
um as far as where that
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
what that affects i i don't know
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
statutorily where it has to wiggle in
 
02:33:34.150 --> 02:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
there per se i mean it was it came over
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
as being in part 5 8 b1
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
as an add-on sentence but
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
um that the intent of that is really i'm
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
just trying to explain the intent here
 
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
with this and
 
02:33:49.510 --> 02:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay that is in fact part of the fun
 
02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
fact okay
 
02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:58.950 align:start position:0%
fact okay
um

02:33:58.950 --> 02:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:34:00.319 --> 02:34:14.830 align:start position:0%
i think
that

02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
if

02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:17.510 align:start position:0%
if
yes

02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
i was thinking
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
if we did it could we put something in
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
the language around the compact
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
where we said that if
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
if the board is unable to
 
02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
get people to serve on the compact
 
02:34:31.359 --> 02:34:32.710 align:start position:0%
get people to serve on the compact
commission

02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
they shall appoint additional board
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
members as necessary to fill those seats
 
02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
i it seems like you could put something
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
like that in the in the audiology
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
or or speech language pathology practice
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
act but i you know certainly mr
 
02:34:53.990 --> 02:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
broderick is here also to to he could
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
weigh in this this would not be this
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
would give the board the ability to
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
point someone that is not on the board
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
right when they can't right
 
02:35:03.270 --> 02:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
right but on the other hand if the
 
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
compact specifies that they be board
 
02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
compact specifies that they be board
members

02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:09.750 align:start position:0%
members
right

02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand why they don't have
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
people on board willing to serve is it
 
02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
they just can't get people to serve on
 
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
that is i can't answer that that's a
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
health and human services question yeah
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
sorry mr broderick do you have any
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
information for us on this issue
 
02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:28.950 align:start position:0%
information for us on this issue
um

02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
sure i i may be able to provide
 
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
something so
 
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think here at oplc i don't think we've
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
had any trouble having um
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
board members or commissioners serve as
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
a member of the combat commission so
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen that issue here
 
02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:46.550 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen that issue here
um

02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
as far as where the language should be
 
02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:52.830 align:start position:0%
as far as where the language should be
added

02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
i and
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that for compacts
 
02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
to work
 
02:36:00.950 --> 02:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
each state needs to enact substantively
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
the same language i'm not sure whether
 
02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
this would
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
whether this would basically invalidate
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire being able to join
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
these contacts or not i can um email the
 
02:36:12.479 --> 02:36:13.429 align:start position:0%
these contacts or not i can um email the
com

02:36:13.429 --> 02:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
com
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
the draft is the compact language
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
um right now and see if i can get back
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
from them
 
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay person broda you wish to speak to
 
02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:26.870 align:start position:0%
okay person broda you wish to speak to
us

02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair could we make
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
it a contingency of the compact but if
 
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have anyone that wants to sit
 
02:36:35.830 --> 02:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
on the at the table or be on the board
 
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
after all if you don't have somebody who
 
02:36:50.710 --> 02:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
wants to take responsibility for it then
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
does that not in in essence allow allow
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
a board to protest themselves out of a
 
02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:00.309 align:start position:0%
a board to protest themselves out of a
compact

02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
compact
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:12.309 --> 02:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
if they can't fill seats that doesn't
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
pull us out of the contact that would
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
require a separate statutory action
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry what i meant was if we
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
don't have someone who's willing to be
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
part of if we know ahead of time one of
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
the commitments of joining this compact
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
would be and i think that this is uh
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
this should be with all compacts that
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
institute one of the requirements to
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
participate in the contract or to join
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
the contract compact is to be assured
 
02:37:36.870 --> 02:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
that we have people who want to
 
02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:38.309 align:start position:0%
that we have people who want to
participate

02:37:38.309 --> 02:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
participate
 
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
in its structure
 
02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%

02:37:45.990 --> 02:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
schuettner
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
yes i guess um
 
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
my point is sort of aligned with
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative grota's um
 
02:37:53.439 --> 02:37:54.230 align:start position:0%
representative grota's um
my

02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
was that uh in order to qualify
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
as a board member on the board in state
 
02:38:06.309 --> 02:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
it should stated are you able to fulfill
 
02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
this sort of commitment
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
before you would
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
put yourself forward as a nominee for a
 
02:38:15.990 --> 02:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
interesting representative roy
 
02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:19.830 align:start position:0%
interesting representative roy
um

02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
i guess the problem is well well we're
 
02:38:23.670 --> 02:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
we might be um
 
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
looking for a
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem if if
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have the board members now
 
02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be trying to put forth the
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
compact and there's no way we can
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
guarantee somebody in perpetuity is
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
going to be willing to serve on the
 
02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
compact so the fact that saying that we
 
02:38:43.030 --> 02:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
need someone to serve in order to be
 
02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
part of the compact it it
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
first of all i don't even think that
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
language would fly by the the getting
 
02:38:50.309 --> 02:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
into the compact and second of all it
 
02:38:51.910 --> 02:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
still would require legislative action
 
02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
to get us out of the combat so i think
 
02:38:55.910 --> 02:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
we might be getting a little far afield
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
into this
 
02:39:01.110 --> 02:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
yeah if if i can speak
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree with that i mean and the
 
02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
other thing is putting a requirement in
 
02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
something like somebody before they get
 
02:39:08.389 --> 02:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
appointed to a board has to agree they
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
can serve i mean that's a nice idea but
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's not nothing like that's
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
enforceable um
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
you know somebody is going to be
 
02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
appointed a position and accepts it
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
presumably they're going to try and do
 
02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
it but again you can't enforce it
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can put something in to
 
02:39:30.630 --> 02:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
cause this to happen conditionally
 
02:39:32.150 --> 02:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know either we decide to do it or we
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
don't it's my understanding
 
02:39:35.359 --> 02:39:40.389 align:start position:0%
don't it's my understanding
thanks

02:39:40.389 --> 02:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you it's enforceable if you put it
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
into the statue
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
so it is what it is you know and we're
 
02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
making what we're doing right now is
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're setting policy
 
02:39:51.429 --> 02:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
and if we don't
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
and so i just think that should be part
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:59.359 --> 02:40:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:02.630 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:40:04.830 --> 02:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um by not enforceable i mean if
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
somebody says they're going to be
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
available and they're appointed to a
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
board and then they don't show up
 
02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
i mean are we going to find them as a
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor you know
 
02:40:16.309 --> 02:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
how would we enforce it that's you could
 
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
put things in statute but if there's not
 
02:40:23.990 --> 02:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative shelves
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
yes medicare um
 
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know that this is a problem that
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed by echoing a previous
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
statement i don't know that
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
we even need to worry about it at this
 
02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
point i mean i think we're trying to
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
create a problem and then fix it as far
 
02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
as i'm concerned
 
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
i think the way that it would be in
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
the statutes for this profession are
 
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
these technically it's more than one
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
profession but
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
one section of the law i think um makes
 
02:41:01.349 --> 02:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
total sense i think the bigger issues
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
around compacts
 
02:41:06.230 --> 02:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
maybe is a bigger worthwhile discussion
 
02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:07.830 align:start position:0%
maybe is a bigger worthwhile discussion
um

02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:09.349 align:start position:0%
um
but

02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
much of the issues that are being raised
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there are even
 
02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
problems yet i think
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
having a bigger conversation on compacts
 
02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
is maybe something we should do
 
02:41:20.469 --> 02:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
i i'm supportive of it
 
02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
if the profession
 
02:41:27.270 --> 02:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
asks for the compact which in this case
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
they are and as far as i know there
 
02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't any opposition
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
to it in this case and another part of
 
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
the bill where we'll get to a section
 
02:41:37.750 --> 02:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of disagreement
 
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
between one section of the profession
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
and another section of the profession
 
02:41:44.469 --> 02:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
and i think maybe those are instances
 
02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
where we shouldn't have a compact but in
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
this case it seems to be unanimous
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
just again as far as the board
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
memberships and stuff i'm not even sure
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
that that's that's jermaine and before
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
us because i mean what are we going to
 
02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:05.349 align:start position:0%
us because i mean what are we going to
do

02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
um amend so that every single board we'd
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
have to amend how many statutes to put
 
02:42:12.070 --> 02:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
that in there that they were required to
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
be served on compacts and such um i
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
think that's we're just getting really
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:25.830 --> 02:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
circling back around just a reminder
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
that all of this all this sentence does
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
is that it says that if
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
if um they can't find someone to sit on
 
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
the board that they can go are not on
 
02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
the board on the compact that they can
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
go beyond their board of directors to
 
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
appoint someone this just enables them
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
to fit to fill the seat and that's it
 
02:42:45.030 --> 02:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
period there's no other
 
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's no other anything else with it
 
02:42:49.270 --> 02:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
that that's all that's all that that's
 
02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
saying and like i said it was brought
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
forth by helmand health and human
 
02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
services because
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
they are understanding that this is a
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
problem that they are going to
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
potentially have so
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay it doesn't it doesn't restrict
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
anything else in any way
 
02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
mr broderick do you have an answer for
 
02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:07.030 align:start position:0%
mr broderick do you have an answer for
us

02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
i i do thank you i heard back from the
 
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
um gentleman at the council of state
 
02:43:14.710 --> 02:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
governments that uh had
 
02:43:14.720 --> 02:43:16.070 align:start position:0%
governments that uh had
uh

02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
that in their the group that put this
 
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
compact together and they generally um
 
02:43:21.910 --> 02:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
they they've created all the compacts i
 
02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
believe um
 
02:43:25.270 --> 02:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
and he is under the opinion that this
 
02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
would invalidate new hampshire's ability
 
02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
to join that is a material material
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and i i did just hear that the and
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'd have to find this in the statutory
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
language in front of the compact
 
02:43:58.710 --> 02:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
commission that's put together of these
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
may be able to
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
draft up rules um
 
02:44:03.910 --> 02:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
saying who could be appointed if there
 
02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
is no board member available
 
02:44:08.469 --> 02:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that would take care of
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
the issue if it
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's more impor more useful to take care
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
of it if it arises
 
02:44:16.870 --> 02:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
boy this sounds like federalism and
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
state uh state rights all over again i'm
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
seeing red here that this compact is
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
unwilling to make such a reasonable uh
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
kind of accommodation
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh i sure hope they can
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's that's
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know we're not this is not a major
 
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
change it's a reasonable thing and
 
02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
all right i've had my cancer
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay represent blackest did you get your
 
02:44:41.429 --> 02:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
point made
 
02:44:41.439 --> 02:44:42.309 align:start position:0%
point made
uh

02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh mr broderick mainly answered my
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
question and to representative scitec i
 
02:44:50.389 --> 02:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
as i understand it for the language the
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
process would be
 
02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
i mean they couldn't just answer that to
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
him and agree to make the change the
 
02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
commission that if we join we'd be part
 
02:44:58.640 --> 02:44:59.750 align:start position:0%
commission that if we join we'd be part
of

02:44:59.750 --> 02:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
would meet and would be able to set or
 
02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
change the rules so
 
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
they may very well be willing to make
 
02:45:06.870 --> 02:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
the accommodation but there's a process
 
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
they'd have to go through to do it
 
02:45:13.349 --> 02:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:19.349 --> 02:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
and just to represent a psychic's point
 
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's why i have issues with jumping in
 
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
feet first into these compacts
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
i think we should wait and let them play
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
out a little while longer before we get
 
02:45:29.590 --> 02:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:31.269 align:start position:0%
it thank you
okay

02:45:31.269 --> 02:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:31.279 --> 02:45:33.510 align:start position:0%
okay
interesting

02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:46.630 align:start position:0%
 
adopt

02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
adopt
section

02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:49.190 align:start position:0%
section
5

02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
5
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
with the change that we delete this one
 
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the duplicate sections
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
on the compact language
 
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
namely the section that
 
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
is not in the speech-language
 
02:46:04.469 --> 02:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
pathologists and audiologists practice
 
02:46:04.479 --> 02:46:05.670 align:start position:0%
pathologists and audiologists practice
act

02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
we add the amendment with the language
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
board oplc will cover any costs incurred
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
in the comments
 
02:46:17.439 --> 02:46:19.269 align:start position:0%
in the comments
uh

02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
ms marling is that clear enough for you
 
02:46:23.110 --> 02:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
to draft the amendment
 
02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
yes i would i would only add that we'll
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
also put the occupational therapy
 
02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
compact act into the occupational
 
02:46:32.309 --> 02:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
therapy practice act
 
02:46:34.469 --> 02:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that would
 
02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
be consistent
 
02:46:38.230 --> 02:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
all right so does everyone understand
 
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.510 --> 02:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay so we're done we're going to the
 
02:46:52.389 --> 02:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
motion is to adopt section 5 with three
 
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendments too
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
02:46:56.319 --> 02:46:57.110 align:start position:0%
uh what
what

02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:47:00.550 --> 02:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh first took the oklc language to cover
 
02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
costs and uh leading a duplicate section
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
what about what uh ms sparling just said
 
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
about the exact part of this that's part
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the duplicate section
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that that the compact language
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
is included under the practice act for
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
both professionals and did mr broderick
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
have it oh
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
mr uh representative leck has said that
 
02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:25.590 align:start position:0%
mr uh representative leck has said that
um

02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:26.790 align:start position:0%
um
we

02:47:26.790 --> 02:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:47:28.469 --> 02:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
there it's not that the compact is
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
opposed it's that we have to go through
 
02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
the proper procedure
 
02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
and we uh are yeah all right
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that
 
02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:39.750 align:start position:0%
yeah that
um

02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:41.349 --> 02:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
all right representative you have a
 
02:47:41.359 --> 02:47:42.630 align:start position:0%
all right representative you have a
comment

02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh question madam chair are are we about
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
to vote on just
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
the corrected language that the
 
02:47:53.269 --> 02:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is putting forward or are
 
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
we in fact voting on accepting the
 
02:47:56.240 --> 02:47:57.269 align:start position:0%
we in fact voting on accepting the
entire

02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
entire
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
section with that language
 
02:48:02.070 --> 02:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh well since it's not an official
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
amendment i think
 
02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh yeah well let's do it in two passes
 
02:48:09.269 --> 02:48:09.279 align:start position:0%
the first one is to correct the section
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
by making
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
those changes
 
02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
namely the cost and the proper statutory
 
02:48:18.319 --> 02:48:20.469 align:start position:0%
namely the cost and the proper statutory
organization

02:48:20.469 --> 02:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay everyone clear
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
yes women i'm sure what you're saying is
 
02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's proposed
 
02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:28.309 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's proposed
language

02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
cannot be added
 
02:48:33.190 --> 02:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
it cannot be added directly because it
 
02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
would affect the compact and we have
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
heard that the
 
02:48:36.479 --> 02:48:37.830 align:start position:0%
heard that the
compact

02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
compact
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
the writers of the compact think that's
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
a material change yeah i'm withdrawing
 
02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:43.990 align:start position:0%
a material change yeah i'm withdrawing
that

02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i just want to make sure
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
i will be yes thank you
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:48:51.670 --> 02:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
so on the
 
02:48:54.630 --> 02:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
the third
 
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt if you would mute
 
02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
yourself when you're taking calls we'd
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
or is that not a call oh you did mute
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.439 --> 02:49:16.389 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
my mistake
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
so the analogy to a regular bill is
 
02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:21.750 align:start position:0%
so the analogy to a regular bill is
worth

02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
worth
 
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
not the amendment then we'll talk about
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
right okay so this is about whether we
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
should make those changes to the
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
to the section before deciding whether
 
02:49:34.469 --> 02:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to adopt it
 
02:49:34.479 --> 02:49:35.750 align:start position:0%
we're going to adopt it
so

02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:37.110 align:start position:0%
so
okay

02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:49:39.590 --> 02:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
all right representative roy
 
02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:42.070 align:start position:0%

all right so we agree that's what we
 
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
should do
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
for that this section
 
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:07.840 align:start position:0%

02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%

this anyone else wish to speak
 
02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well i did vote
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
for the amendment i think it
 
02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
made some needed changes to the uh bill
 
02:51:54.720 --> 02:51:55.830 align:start position:0%
made some needed changes to the uh bill
itself

02:51:55.830 --> 02:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:51:57.429 --> 02:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
i will not support
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
this going into the compact
 
02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
i think we heard just one minor tweak to
 
02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that we want to make here in
 
02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire could nullify us in the
 
02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
compact and that's one of the issues i
 
02:52:09.910 --> 02:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
have is we have to go by their rules and
 
02:52:13.110 --> 02:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
and i have issues with uh the way these
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
compacts are drafted up with some of the
 
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
language in there um
 
02:52:20.469 --> 02:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
and i will just be brief some of the
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
language that they're allowed to do
 
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
purchase and maintain insurance bonds
 
02:52:27.269 --> 02:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
our employees
 
02:52:29.429 --> 02:52:29.439 align:start position:0%
accept or contract for services or
 
02:52:31.349 --> 02:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
personnel including but not limited to
 
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
employees of a member state
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
lease purchase accept appropriate gifts
 
02:52:39.349 --> 02:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
and donate of otherwise abort own and to
 
02:52:41.910 --> 02:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
sell convey mortgage pledge lease
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
exchange abandoned otherwise dispose of
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
any property real personal index
 
02:52:49.590 --> 02:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
it gives a lot of authority there and
 
02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
things that they can do uh
 
02:52:59.750 --> 02:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
i look at as dollar signs and aren't
 
02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
going to be costly um so
 
02:53:03.590 --> 02:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
i just
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
am lenient about jumping in on these
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
with these languages that it has a lot
 
02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:09.349 align:start position:0%
with these languages that it has a lot
of

02:53:09.349 --> 02:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:53:11.030 --> 02:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
terms that
 
02:53:13.590 --> 02:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
could cost money and um
 
02:53:16.389 --> 02:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
um gonna vote no thank you
 
02:53:16.399 --> 02:53:18.469 align:start position:0%
um gonna vote no thank you
representative

02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting no also uh taking a cue
 
02:53:23.439 --> 02:53:24.389 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting no also uh taking a cue
from

02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
what uh representative roy actually said
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
originally and uh representative scitec
 
02:53:31.990 --> 02:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
if this particular
 
02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
in-state board is not
 
02:53:38.469 --> 02:53:38.479 align:start position:0%
quite ready to commit to
 
02:53:41.269 --> 02:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
membership on the compact
 
02:53:43.030 --> 02:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
it sounds as though perhaps we're not
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
ready to jump into this
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
specific concept so i'll be voting no
 
02:53:49.349 --> 02:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:53:51.269 --> 02:53:51.279 align:start position:0%
hoping that if they care to do this in
 
02:53:52.630 --> 02:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
the future
 
02:53:54.550 --> 02:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it could come back as a single
 
02:53:55.990 --> 02:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill rather than
 
02:54:01.349 --> 02:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:01.359 --> 02:54:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:54:05.269 --> 02:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
i i if i i'll vote for this on the
 
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
strength that the nursing compact seems
 
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
to work so well even though
 
02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:14.630 align:start position:0%
to work so well even though
i

02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think i
 
02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:17.030 align:start position:0%
i think i
i'm

02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
this is a hard one to
 
02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
when in doubt do the right thing and all
 
02:54:21.439 --> 02:54:22.790 align:start position:0%
when in doubt do the right thing and all
right

02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
thank you there are a couple of other
 
02:54:26.309 --> 02:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
people who wish to speak but i have to
 
02:54:26.319 --> 02:54:27.190 align:start position:0%
people who wish to speak but i have to
leave

02:54:27.190 --> 02:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
leave
 
02:54:29.190 --> 02:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
reassess this meeting until
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
1 30
 
02:54:35.190 --> 02:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
and we will resume the debate i hope
 
02:54:37.030 --> 02:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
everyone has a chance to polish their
 
02:54:39.910 --> 02:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
speeches and make them uh
 
02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
brief and convincing because
 
02:54:46.230 --> 02:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
so we can finish this section
 
02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:57.510 --> 02:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:00.389 align:start position:0%
 
until

02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:03.750 --> 02:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
1 30. i have one concern
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
this is you know i know we're not in
 
02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
session or you know the committee's not
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
in session right now but one general
 
02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
concern about what the senate has done
 
02:55:14.309 --> 02:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
is that you know they get a situation if
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
someone feels strongly enough opposed to
 
02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
some section
 
02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
that the committee as a whole votes to
 
02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:21.269 align:start position:0%
that the committee as a whole votes to
include

02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:55:23.349 --> 02:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
then they're put in a difficult position
 
02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
of either
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
letting it go through by voting for the
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
overall bill as amended or
 
02:55:30.870 --> 02:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
or voting against the whole bill and if
 
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
enough people feel that way and could
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
end up with the whole bill dead even
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
though you know the majority would have
 
02:55:38.870 --> 02:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
approved at least some section so i
 
02:55:40.309 --> 02:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
don't really appreciate what the senate
 
02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
has done to us
 
02:55:41.439 --> 02:55:42.790 align:start position:0%
has done to us
but

02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:55:44.070 --> 02:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
nothing we could do about it at this
 
02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
point i guess so there's no possibility
 
02:55:49.910 --> 02:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
for like a committee of conference
 
02:55:51.349 --> 02:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
no they'd have um
 
02:55:54.150 --> 02:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
we passed another version wouldn't that
 
02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:57.349 align:start position:0%
we passed another version wouldn't that
be

02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean we as a committee though
 
02:56:01.349 --> 02:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know at this point are either going
 
02:56:03.429 --> 02:56:03.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to we can amend the bill and
 
02:56:05.910 --> 02:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
include whatever sections
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
we do but you might not have the same
 
02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:09.190 align:start position:0%
we do but you might not have the same
majority

02:56:09.190 --> 02:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
majority
 
02:56:11.830 --> 02:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
voting to accept the different sections
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to vote on the overall
 
02:56:15.670 --> 02:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill as amended we can only
 
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know as individuals on the committee
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
we can either vote to
 
02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
for or against dr pastor's amendment
 
02:56:23.910 --> 02:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the committee has done
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
and you know if there's some point
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
something in the bill that one that some
 
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
of us feel is completely unacceptable
 
02:56:32.469 --> 02:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
then it would make sense to vote against
 
02:56:33.990 --> 02:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
the whole bill in which case
 
02:56:36.309 --> 02:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
um it would go to the floor with a uh
 
02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know and i you know well then that
 
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
well the same thing happens when it goes
 
02:56:49.429 --> 02:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
to the floor some people would vote
 
02:56:51.030 --> 02:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
against it just because they didn't like
 
02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:52.230 align:start position:0%
against it just because they didn't like
one

02:56:52.230 --> 02:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:56:55.110 --> 02:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
section two right but that's an argument
 
02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
i think an insomnia still so anyway
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's mine back to you ask alicia just
 
02:57:03.670 --> 02:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
ask alicia she'll tell you
 
02:57:06.389 --> 02:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
i see her in the car there ask her
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
she'll square you away
 
02:57:10.469 --> 02:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
hi lis
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh she she can't talk i just uh dropped
 
02:57:14.309 --> 02:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
her off for a doctor's visit so that's
 
02:57:16.309 --> 02:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
why i'm oh i'm sorry anyway i see her
 
02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
waving her hand at me which was my
 
02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
purpose in the first place
 
02:57:22.150 --> 02:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
anyway of course
 
02:57:24.230 --> 02:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
peter the room's going mute okay we're
 
02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
at lunch you guys can talk amongst
 
02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
yourselves but the room's gonna go mute
 
02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:28.710 align:start position:0%
yourselves but the room's gonna go mute
okay

02:57:28.710 --> 02:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:03.439 --> 03:58:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.030 --> 03:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.040 --> 03:58:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
yes we are
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
so we are in section five what you pass
 
03:58:50.150 --> 03:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
with these uh amendments right
 
03:58:51.110 --> 03:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're not acting like they can hear me
 
03:58:54.790 --> 03:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
we can hear you we can hear you yeah
 
03:59:00.070 --> 03:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
good i will
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
reconfirm that we
 
03:59:02.720 --> 03:59:04.150 align:start position:0%
reconfirm that we
uh

03:59:04.150 --> 03:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
that there is in fact only one minority
 
03:59:07.600 --> 03:59:09.750 align:start position:0%
that there is in fact only one minority
report

03:59:09.750 --> 03:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:59:09.760 --> 03:59:11.670 align:start position:0%
report
and

03:59:11.670 --> 03:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:13.349 --> 03:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
so that would presumably have a
 
03:59:15.429 --> 03:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
different amendment
 
03:59:18.309 --> 03:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
however if on the floor a section was
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
left in that a substantial number of
 
03:59:22.630 --> 03:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
people wish to delete
 
03:59:25.269 --> 03:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
it would be quite straightforward
 
03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
to divide the question
 
03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
after the amendment's adopted and
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
kill that section or try to kill that
 
03:59:35.910 --> 03:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.150 --> 03:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
adding a new new section by a floor
 
03:59:42.630 --> 03:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:45.349 --> 03:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay that would be worth it
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
i would say yes it would be more
 
03:59:46.800 --> 03:59:49.030 align:start position:0%
i would say yes it would be more
difficult

03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
03:59:49.040 --> 03:59:50.469 align:start position:0%
difficult
okay

03:59:50.469 --> 03:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:59:50.479 --> 03:59:51.910 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:59:51.910 --> 03:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
we're assuming
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
we were discussing the question of
 
03:59:57.990 --> 03:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
whether section
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
5 should pass as
 
04:00:03.429 --> 04:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:03.439 --> 04:00:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:00:04.630 --> 04:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
well i haven't said anything yet so if
 
04:00:21.359 --> 04:00:22.790 align:start position:0%
well i haven't said anything yet so if
uh

04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
if no one else wishes to speak i will uh
 
04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
chime in with my two cents worth
 
04:00:28.720 --> 04:00:29.590 align:start position:0%
chime in with my two cents worth
and

04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
probably three or four cents for that
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
matter knowing me but in any case uh the
 
04:00:36.870 --> 04:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
reality is that we we are already party
 
04:00:39.990 --> 04:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
to a number of compacts in the state
 
04:00:43.110 --> 04:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh i think oplc has is involved in four
 
04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
or five of them principally the nurse
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
compact and and uh
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
and and we're participating in a number
 
04:00:53.349 --> 04:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
of other compacts one of the things that
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
i think is central and i have not
 
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
discussed this with uh other members
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
other than i did have a conversation
 
04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
with representative goldie about the
 
04:01:04.870 --> 04:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
other the replica situation a couple of
 
04:01:08.309 --> 04:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
days ago but i i raised this point then
 
04:01:09.990 --> 04:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll raise it now
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
that is that this committee
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
above all others would certainly have
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh heard of
 
04:01:21.910 --> 04:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
problems with compacts or we would see
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
bills to withdraw from compacts if
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's what's required uh and point of
 
04:01:29.349 --> 04:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
fact we don't see anything like that and
 
04:01:32.550 --> 04:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
i've been on the committee for 15 years
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
so i think we were having problems with
 
04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
compacts we would be parties to uh
 
04:01:40.150 --> 04:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from compacts if legislation
 
04:01:42.309 --> 04:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
were necessary or we would certainly
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
have seen objections on the part of
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
any of the speech pathologists
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists and audiologists
 
04:01:52.229 --> 04:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
and mr broderick told us that there had
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
been no objections
 
04:01:53.760 --> 04:01:54.469 align:start position:0%
been no objections
to

04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:56.150 --> 04:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
the attempt to
 
04:02:00.389 --> 04:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
join the compacts in question um so i
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
think that's very important that uh that
 
04:02:05.349 --> 04:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
we are already party to a number of
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
compacts a significant number of
 
04:02:09.750 --> 04:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
compacts and we see mutual aid
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
situations among
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh firefighters for example uh so that
 
04:02:16.710 --> 04:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
if they are
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
combating a situation in their own town
 
04:02:21.910 --> 04:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh they called for mutual aid uh
 
04:02:24.150 --> 04:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
similarly with the ice storm of a
 
04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
eversource hired
 
04:02:31.590 --> 04:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
line crews from all over this all over
 
04:02:34.070 --> 04:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
the area to come and help us out so
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
mutual aid is uh
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
is a very common phenomenon and it's
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
barn raising goes back centuries so this
 
04:02:44.710 --> 04:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
this is a an
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to provide additional resources
 
04:02:51.510 --> 04:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
to our citizens of our state um and so i
 
04:02:54.790 --> 04:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
will be supporting this uh this
 
04:02:57.750 --> 04:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
this portion of the bill
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
04:03:01.830 --> 04:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
and you've you've inspired other people
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
to speak as well representative fellows
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair i
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
i would just like to ask the people that
 
04:03:11.830 --> 04:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
were on the subcommittee
 
04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
if they heard from any actual
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
audiologists you know practicing
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
audiologists or or speech pathologists
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm just wondering about
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
their perspective
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
i don't and i can't remember back to the
 
04:03:29.189 --> 04:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know when we first heard the heard
 
04:03:31.590 --> 04:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
that bill i don't remember any testimony
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
from either of those groups but maybe
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's a good question
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
i will also mention that mr broderick
 
04:03:45.510 --> 04:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
came back to me with an email saying
 
04:03:47.189 --> 04:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
that the boards
 
04:03:49.510 --> 04:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
do not object to this in fact they
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
support the compact and they and oplc
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
has never seen any difficulty in getting
 
04:03:58.229 --> 04:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
board members to serve on the compact
 
04:03:59.830 --> 04:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:03:59.840 --> 04:04:00.870 align:start position:0%
so the
question

04:04:00.870 --> 04:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:04:00.880 --> 04:04:01.990 align:start position:0%
question
the

04:04:01.990 --> 04:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:05.349 --> 04:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was brought forward
 
04:04:07.349 --> 04:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to be necessary because
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
the board members
 
04:04:11.830 --> 04:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
have in practice been willing to step up
 
04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
to the compact
 
04:04:14.640 --> 04:04:15.990 align:start position:0%
to the compact
uh

04:04:15.990 --> 04:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
but the question was that michael
 
04:04:21.750 --> 04:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry thank you velvet you do you
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
have an answer
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:04:27.670 --> 04:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
i missed the question the question was
 
04:04:29.910 --> 04:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
did you hear from any audiologist or
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
anyone objecting to the contract in your
 
04:04:32.319 --> 04:04:33.830 align:start position:0%
anyone objecting to the contract in your
work

04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:04:38.710 --> 04:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:40.630 --> 04:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative it's a question to
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
so exactly he was the chair
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative roy would you uh
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:02.950 --> 04:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
hello um
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
anyone on the subcommittee please
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but i don't
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
recall any live testimony from uh any
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
individual pathologist however um
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
i can speak for myself and i'm sure
 
04:05:18.150 --> 04:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
other members have received emails
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
from various people in the field that
 
04:05:22.630 --> 04:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
have said that they are in favor of this
 
04:05:25.750 --> 04:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't get any against it
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
and i had my hand raised because i just
 
04:05:28.870 --> 04:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
want to address something
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
earlier representative goalie's concern
 
04:05:32.309 --> 04:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
broad powers that these contacts seem to
 
04:05:37.590 --> 04:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
have granted themselves
 
04:05:39.510 --> 04:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that's a legitimate concern and was
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
also a concern of mine with regard to
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
getting into mortgages and hiring
 
04:05:45.429 --> 04:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
employees and purchasing and selling
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
real property
 
04:05:48.870 --> 04:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
which was why we insisted that any
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
expense in the compact be borne by oplc
 
04:05:53.760 --> 04:05:54.630 align:start position:0%
expense in the compact be borne by oplc
so

04:05:54.630 --> 04:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
because that would be in statute
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
the compact would have no ability to
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
bind us to any kind of an expense beyond
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
what lplc can afford
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
um so i i think we've covered our bases
 
04:06:08.550 --> 04:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
on that and as representative schmidt
 
04:06:10.150 --> 04:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
said there's other compacts that have
 
04:06:12.150 --> 04:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
been in existence for quite some time
 
04:06:13.750 --> 04:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i have not heard of any of them
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get into the real estate
 
04:06:15.600 --> 04:06:16.790 align:start position:0%
trying to get into the real estate
business

04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
i think that us
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
as states you know someone very wise
 
04:06:22.950 --> 04:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
once said that you know
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
the the states are where these type of
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
experiments should be happening i forgot
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
the exact terminology um
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
and not at the federal government level
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
mandating you know who's going to
 
04:06:34.710 --> 04:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
cooperate with whom so i think this is
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
the perfect thing for us to do
 
04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
um it's been done before it uses
 
04:06:42.150 --> 04:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
synergies where one state comes up short
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayers of that state aren't
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
able to fill that
 
04:06:48.550 --> 04:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
we can help and they can help us without
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
putting additional burden on our
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers i think it's just a good good
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
idea all around and you know
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
if down the road we see that it's not
 
04:06:59.110 --> 04:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
working out well
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
we can repeal it just like um we do any
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
other statute but right now i i have not
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
heard anything
 
04:07:07.750 --> 04:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
negative about it other than
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
hypotheses so thank you
 
04:07:12.070 --> 04:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:07:14.550 --> 04:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
well i just might want to mention that i
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh spoke at lunch to a trusted adviser
 
04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
who echoed a lot of what representative
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
schmidt said and my concerns were put to
 
04:07:22.319 --> 04:07:23.590 align:start position:0%
schmidt said and my concerns were put to
rest

04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
rest
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
excellent representative
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i agree i was on the
 
04:07:30.870 --> 04:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um we didn't hear
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
anything against it we've got an email
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
and support
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is i mean the the uh
 
04:07:38.309 --> 04:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
compact that we have the most experience
 
04:07:40.710 --> 04:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
with i think and the most uh
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know people involved in it is the
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
nursing one and um
 
04:07:46.870 --> 04:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know i was concerned about this same
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
sort of things that represent goalie was
 
04:07:48.960 --> 04:07:50.150 align:start position:0%
sort of things that represent goalie was
around

04:07:50.150 --> 04:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
they seem to have expansive powers and
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
borrowing money and all that sort of
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
thing the experience with the nursing
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
one is that
 
04:07:59.189 --> 04:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
the cost of new hampshire is something
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
like 6 000 a year
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
and that's more than paid for by the
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
small fee
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
which remember correctly is on the order
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
of 15 or something
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
charged to each one of the
 
04:08:12.389 --> 04:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
people under that compact who are going
 
04:08:13.990 --> 04:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
to operate in new hampshire so there is
 
04:08:15.429 --> 04:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
the ability
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the nursing one and also in the ones
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
where we have here
 
04:08:21.429 --> 04:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
to charge a fee to the people that want
 
04:08:23.910 --> 04:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
to practice in new hampshire
 
04:08:26.790 --> 04:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
um using the compact system to offset
 
04:08:28.150 --> 04:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
the cost so
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
that and the amendment we added uh you
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
know made me comfortable with what we're
 
04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
doing here thanks
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and um i was just going to
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
add it to representative fellow's
 
04:08:43.110 --> 04:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
i i believe i i believe you did receive
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
some written testimony and support from
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
some of the associations i'm going back
 
04:08:51.910 --> 04:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
through my email and it's possible that
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
that only got sent to the senate edna
 
04:08:57.030 --> 04:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
committee not the house um i
 
04:08:58.830 --> 04:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
i would cc'd on them
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
but to my knowledge we've checked as i
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned before with all the
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
relevant associations the new hampshire
 
04:09:10.710 --> 04:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
ota association for occupational therapy
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
they're in support the speech language
 
04:09:15.750 --> 04:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
pathology association um
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
is in in support in the
 
04:09:20.150 --> 04:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned the audiologist there's
 
04:09:20.160 --> 04:09:20.950 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned the audiologist there's
actually

04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:09:25.110 --> 04:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
at least two organizations that um
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
that work with audiologists in the state
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
one is asha and they're in support the
 
04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
others is the i think it's the new
 
04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire audiologist association
 
04:09:36.870 --> 04:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're neutral to in support um they're
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
a very small organization
 
04:09:38.720 --> 04:09:40.830 align:start position:0%
a very small organization
um

04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:44.150 --> 04:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you that's good to know
 
04:09:45.189 --> 04:09:45.199 align:start position:0%

04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
one final point one final point that
 
04:10:01.110 --> 04:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
that that i might offer and that is
 
04:10:03.189 --> 04:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
we certainly have heard from the speech
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
pathologists which with regards to
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh music therapists
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh when they don't like something
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
we we uh they're not shy about letting
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
us know
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
and uh so the fact that we have not
 
04:10:19.750 --> 04:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
heard anything a negative about them
 
04:10:22.309 --> 04:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
from them i should say uh suggests to me
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
that they uh that they are comfortable
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
with proceeding if not
 
04:10:26.479 --> 04:10:27.990 align:start position:0%
with proceeding if not
uh

04:10:27.990 --> 04:10:28.000 align:start position:0%

04:13:51.110 --> 04:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
what it does is that we added
 
04:13:54.309 --> 04:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
under the investigation
 
04:13:56.469 --> 04:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
we said that
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
when requested by the board
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
oplc shall invite assign an investigator
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
who may assist in the investigation
 
04:14:08.550 --> 04:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
which makes it clear that the board has
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
the authority and the initiative
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
and the investigator is essentially an
 
04:14:13.359 --> 04:14:15.429 align:start position:0%
and the investigator is essentially an
employee

04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:14:15.439 --> 04:14:16.790 align:start position:0%
employee
and

04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:18.149 --> 04:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
we added
 
04:14:18.159 --> 04:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
we added
under

04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
roman one we added a new section 1a
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
that these procedures
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
listed our sections are supplementary
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
and shall not supplant or supersede any
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
procedures expressly set forth in any
 
04:14:37.750 --> 04:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
board's individual practice act
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
and that's to deal with the question the
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
situation that some of the boards
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
have very
 
04:14:48.030 --> 04:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
investigative procedures in their
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
practice act the board of medicine does
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
and the board of psychology does for
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
sure because i've worked on both of them
 
04:14:58.870 --> 04:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
i believe there are others
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
on the other hand many of the smaller
 
04:15:00.960 --> 04:15:02.070 align:start position:0%
on the other hand many of the smaller
boards

04:15:02.070 --> 04:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:15:04.870 --> 04:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't have anything very specific
 
04:15:07.110 --> 04:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so these
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
provide a
 
04:15:11.110 --> 04:15:11.120 align:start position:0%

disclose information in it acquired in

an investigation to law enforcement if

04:15:41.830 --> 04:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
rather than just
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
share with law enforcement
 
04:15:46.710 --> 04:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
because we feel that it's only if it is

criminal that law enforcement should be

state the claim of professional conduct

so that if there's something that is

not under the control of the board they

04:16:19.349 --> 04:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
would you repeat that last one again
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
where it isn't
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
it's roman 6
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
let me see if i can find the line in the
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah with page numbers are helpful
 
04:16:38.960 --> 04:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
yeah with page numbers are helpful
because

04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
trying to follow the indents can get a
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
little strange okay you're right
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
okay this is on paper on the bill
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
as abandoned by the senate
 
04:16:50.399 --> 04:16:51.429 align:start position:0%
as abandoned by the senate
it's

04:16:51.429 --> 04:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:16:53.830 --> 04:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
page 42
 
04:16:53.840 --> 04:16:55.189 align:start position:0%

04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
and what was the change
 
04:17:06.960 --> 04:17:08.309 align:start position:0%
and what was the change
amendment

04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
instead of saying the board
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
it says each board council or commission
 
04:17:24.309 --> 04:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's fairly straightforward thank you
 
04:17:28.560 --> 04:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
it's fairly straightforward thank you
okay

04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.750 --> 04:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.760 --> 04:17:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
we're

04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
deleting the first sentence which says
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings shall be open
 
04:17:45.750 --> 04:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
because we're covering the right to know
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
and openness further down
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
romans 7
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
on line 33 also on page 43
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
04:18:07.469 --> 04:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
non-remedial uh
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary remedial actions
 
04:18:10.960 --> 04:18:12.309 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary remedial actions
and

04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:16.229 --> 04:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
upon making line 35 upon making an
 
04:18:19.110 --> 04:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
affirmative finding
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment adds
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
after notice and an opportunity for a
 
04:18:23.520 --> 04:18:24.550 align:start position:0%
after notice and an opportunity for a

04:18:24.550 --> 04:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
to ensure that it's not just
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh an accusation it's there's due
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
process for the uh
 
04:18:33.520 --> 04:18:41.030 align:start position:0%

04:18:45.920 --> 04:18:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
on

page 44
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
after line six which talks about the
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary remedial action
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
we add
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
a new section eight
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
which says all proceedings for
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary remedial action shall
 
04:19:06.870 --> 04:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
be exempt from the provisions of 91a
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
except the board may disclose any final
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
remedial action that affects the status
 
04:19:14.309 --> 04:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
of a license
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
including any non-disciplinary
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions imposed
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's supervision or limitation
 
04:19:30.389 --> 04:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
of practice or whatever
 
04:19:33.189 --> 04:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
that could be public but the reasons for

04:19:49.030 --> 04:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
down bottom of the page line 31
 
04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh technical change it says the board
 
04:19:53.429 --> 04:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
may dispose of issues
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's the board council or commission
 
04:20:01.770 --> 04:20:01.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:01.780 --> 04:20:07.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
romans 6 is deleted
 
04:20:14.469 --> 04:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
ah yes thank you roman 6 is deleted
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%

04:20:34.880 --> 04:20:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:20:36.070 --> 04:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
so we just need to make sure with roman
 
04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
6 deleted that roman 7 has now moved to
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you that is indeed a
 
04:20:46.800 --> 04:20:54.630 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you that is indeed a
requirement

04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:56.389 --> 04:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your for your
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
your perfect point yes
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay on page 46 line four
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
it talks about the board imposing
 
04:21:10.479 --> 04:21:11.830 align:start position:0%
it talks about the board imposing
sections

04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
sections
 
04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:20.070 --> 04:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think the senate imposed sections on
 
04:21:21.030 --> 04:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
us here
 
04:21:21.040 --> 04:21:23.990 align:start position:0%
us here
yeah

04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
you're so correct
 
04:21:28.630 --> 04:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe the rest of it is the
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
section as
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
the bill has
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
sent to us
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
the basic intent of these
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
was to
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
clarify things
 
04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
and make sure that it was
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
specific that the oplc is not
 
04:21:49.110 --> 04:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
doing investigations that works do not
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
support the boards have the initiative
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
they have the technical decision making
 
04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
the oplc is just there to help and
 
04:21:57.120 --> 04:21:58.790 align:start position:0%
the oplc is just there to help and
provide

04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
administrative support which will be
 
04:22:00.800 --> 04:22:02.070 align:start position:0%
administrative support which will be
intent

04:22:02.070 --> 04:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
intent
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
the second was representative goalie you
 
04:22:21.670 --> 04:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
should speak to it
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i think uh you explained it
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
very well well i was not a member of the
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i sat in on the
 
04:22:27.760 --> 04:22:28.950 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i sat in on the
subcommittee

04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:22:28.960 --> 04:22:30.469 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
um

04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:32.469 --> 04:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
and listened to it and actually gave
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
some input and some of these changes
 
04:22:37.830 --> 04:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
were recommendations that i had stated
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
and i think we make it clear that the
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
boards still maintain the authority uh
 
04:22:46.710 --> 04:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
through the process and that like you
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
stated oplc is there to assist
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh so i will support this thank you

is there anyone else who wishes to speak
 
04:23:02.000 --> 04:23:02.790 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
the

04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:05.110 --> 04:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee agreed in concept
 
04:23:05.120 --> 04:23:10.149 align:start position:0%
subcommittee agreed in concept
unanimously

04:23:10.149 --> 04:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
before we call the role uh
 
04:23:17.189 --> 04:23:17.199 align:start position:0%

that we still need that further
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.550 --> 04:23:24.560 align:start position:0%

04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:55.590 --> 04:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment doesn't have a number it's
 
04:30:13.030 --> 04:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:16.870 --> 04:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're um in a lull here when we vote
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
the next after we get through all these
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
sections and we come to an agreement
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
then do we vote on the bill
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
what's the next step after this we've
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
learned the bill next step after this is
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
that we will have an amendment that
 
04:30:35.110 --> 04:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
includes all of the changes we have
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
voted on yes
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
and that will be prepared and we will
 
04:30:41.670 --> 04:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
vote on that amendment and then on the
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
bill as amended
 
04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
that will be a amendment with a number
 
04:30:50.710 --> 04:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
so let's say
 
04:30:54.309 --> 04:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
well i guess we can deal with that later
 
04:30:56.309 --> 04:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll wait for my question i'll i'll
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
continue my questions later when we get
 
04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
there thank you
 
04:31:02.550 --> 04:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
yes so man i'm sure if i'm if i'm
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this right just to get my
 
04:31:06.149 --> 04:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
second squared away here the uh this
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is the part the the bold part
 
04:31:08.560 --> 04:31:09.429 align:start position:0%
amendment is the part the the bold part
in

04:31:09.429 --> 04:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:31:11.590 --> 04:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
section two part one that's
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's in essence what this is doing yep
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's i i believe a way just it's
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
describing how they are dealing with the
 
04:31:21.199 --> 04:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
describing how they are dealing with the
uh

04:31:23.040 --> 04:31:23.050 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:23.050 --> 04:31:26.070 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:31:27.750 --> 04:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
the question of
 
04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
of how to
 
04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're qualified
 
04:31:31.040 --> 04:31:31.910 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're qualified
yeah

04:31:31.910 --> 04:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:31:31.920 --> 04:31:32.950 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
i i have a question i'm looking at the
 
04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
texas an amendment
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
there's the bold part is that the only
 
04:31:41.750 --> 04:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
change or is this all this text in here
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
in the uh proposed amendment also change
 
04:31:46.870 --> 04:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
oh i don't know
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
unless it says it's a new section
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
only the bolded stuff would be
 
04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
a change
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yes the rest of this is the same
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay so they just included a lot of
 
04:32:01.269 --> 04:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
stuff that might not need to abandon
 
04:32:03.189 --> 04:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
exactly that's just for context you can
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand it but the actual change is
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
only to roman 1 on page 48
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay and so this is just how they can
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
transition from this new thing to
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually being licensed as an lna it
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
looks like correct
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:33.439 --> 04:32:34.389 align:start position:0%
 
so so

04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
so so
 
04:32:36.790 --> 04:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
i have the amendment but
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
i have the amendment it's gonna take me
 
04:32:40.710 --> 04:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
a little while to read it
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's only the wrong section roman one
 
04:32:45.110 --> 04:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
that makes a difference
 
04:32:45.120 --> 04:32:55.670 align:start position:0%
that makes a difference
okay

04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:57.189 --> 04:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
the attachment of the email i think it's
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
just the bold section which is only a
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
couple of few lines
 
04:33:01.040 --> 04:33:11.029 align:start position:0%
couple of few lines
exactly

04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:11.039 --> 04:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:14.830 --> 04:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question yes
 
04:33:18.310 --> 04:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative so part nine refers to
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
essentially expanding the
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
well expanding the door to those people
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
who want to serve
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
oh these are the temporary health
 
04:33:28.320 --> 04:33:29.830 align:start position:0%
oh these are the temporary health
partners

04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
partners
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
this one is this is it the amendment
 
04:33:33.269 --> 04:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
that deals with temporary health
 
04:33:33.279 --> 04:33:34.551 align:start position:0%
that deals with temporary health
partners

04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
partners
 
04:33:35.830 --> 04:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
no yes
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
no temporary health partners are defined
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
and authorized in senate bill 155
 
04:33:42.719 --> 04:33:43.670 align:start position:0%
and authorized in senate bill 155
right

04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:33:43.680 --> 04:33:44.470 align:start position:0%
right
this

04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
this section gives the people who who
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
have been temporary health partners
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
a way to become full-fledged licensed
 
04:33:53.760 --> 04:33:55.109 align:start position:0%
a way to become full-fledged licensed
lnas

04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
lnas
 
04:33:55.119 --> 04:33:56.629 align:start position:0%
lnas
okay

04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:57.910 --> 04:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
all right so this is the one that we
 
04:33:59.189 --> 04:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
when people have already started this
 
04:34:01.600 --> 04:34:02.709 align:start position:0%
when people have already started this
process

04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:34:05.670 --> 04:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
but may not have completely finished it
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
based on when they started working
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're sort of
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
no we're not exactly we're saying that
 
04:34:23.349 --> 04:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
since they qualified as temporary health
 
04:34:25.910 --> 04:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
partners and actually served as
 
04:34:27.590 --> 04:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
temporary health partners for more than
 
04:34:29.189 --> 04:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
100 hours
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
we're considering that
 
04:34:33.750 --> 04:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate training to get the
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
um lna license
 
04:34:38.830 --> 04:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
okay and i have a last
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
question it says here in a purpose thank
 
04:34:43.990 --> 04:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
you the general court acknowledges the
 
04:34:45.510 --> 04:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
critical importance of ensuring the
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
quality accessibility and sustainability
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
of medicaid services
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
so are we saying that
 
04:34:55.830 --> 04:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
this would only apply
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
to those nursing
 
04:35:02.070 --> 04:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
accept medicaid services
 
04:35:08.310 --> 04:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
i believe that it was the temporary
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
health partners were only being hired in
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
04:35:12.719 --> 04:35:13.510 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
but

04:35:13.510 --> 04:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:14.789 --> 04:35:14.799 align:start position:0%
this doesn't
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
that that's just a statement of purpose
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
this bill or this section deals with how
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
a temporary nursing
 
04:35:24.719 --> 04:35:25.830 align:start position:0%
a temporary nursing
assistant

04:35:25.830 --> 04:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
would become a licensed nursing business
 
04:35:29.199 --> 04:35:30.070 align:start position:0%
would become a licensed nursing business
right

04:35:30.070 --> 04:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
but they would have had to work in the
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
04:35:32.240 --> 04:35:33.349 align:start position:0%
nursing home
yeah

04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:35:34.629 --> 04:35:34.639 align:start position:0%

04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
questions comments
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%

04:36:13.590 --> 04:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
one even though stephen
 
04:36:13.600 --> 04:36:14.310 align:start position:0%
one even though stephen
yes

04:36:14.310 --> 04:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%

04:36:19.510 --> 04:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
hand the next time
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
even though
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
not all nursing homes except medicaid
 
04:36:25.830 --> 04:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
so if they're going to use medicaid
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
services as a purpose
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
it's either there for a reason or not
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
and if it's not there for a particular
 
04:36:36.310 --> 04:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
reason it shouldn't be used
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative broda if you are
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
04:36:43.029 --> 04:36:43.039 align:start position:0%
that issue which i can see is invalid we
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
can just take the whole statement of
 
04:36:48.629 --> 04:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
purpose out because that's not really
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
any action that's just
 
04:36:53.429 --> 04:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
general introductory verbiage and i'd be
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy to recommend that we
 
04:36:56.551 --> 04:36:56.561 align:start position:0%
delete it
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
please i would like that
 
04:36:58.320 --> 04:37:00.310 align:start position:0%
please i would like that
okay

04:37:00.310 --> 04:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:00.320 --> 04:37:01.269 align:start position:0%
okay
sorry

04:37:01.269 --> 04:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:37:05.349 --> 04:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
is is there any objection on the
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
wrestling committee to taking out the
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.879 --> 04:37:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:37:17.349 --> 04:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
the statement of purpose uh
 
04:37:19.760 --> 04:37:20.789 align:start position:0%
the statement of purpose uh
gives

04:37:20.789 --> 04:37:20.799 align:start position:0%
gives
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
people some kind of information about
 
04:37:26.070 --> 04:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
the co it provides the context
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
so i mean it doesn't the only thing
 
04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
that's being changed here well
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's a separate issue really the
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
bolder language is the only thing that's
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
new the statement of purpose is part of
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:37:38.080 --> 04:37:39.109 align:start position:0%
the bill
uh

04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
and it says can amend the section to
 
04:37:43.109 --> 04:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
take that statement
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
sure we can we can take it out but then
 
04:37:47.109 --> 04:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
you have no context for the
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
change that we want to make
 
04:37:53.189 --> 04:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
all right we'll have a vote on
 
04:37:59.590 --> 04:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
what the clarification to the objection
 
04:38:04.230 --> 04:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
to the word medicaid
 
04:38:06.390 --> 04:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
in this is because i don't see it as
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
being restricted
 
04:38:12.470 --> 04:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
not all nursing homes except medicaid
 
04:38:15.189 --> 04:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
agreed and
 
04:38:15.199 --> 04:38:16.310 align:start position:0%
agreed and
um

04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:16.320 --> 04:38:17.670 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the part of actionable does
 
04:38:22.150 --> 04:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
it does it list medicaid as being a
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
criteria or
 
04:38:24.240 --> 04:38:25.189 align:start position:0%
criteria or
to

04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.561 --> 04:38:32.070 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:38:32.070 --> 04:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of what representative
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
schmidt said i think that the statement
 
04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
of purpose to this section is somewhat
 
04:38:38.000 --> 04:38:39.269 align:start position:0%
of purpose to this section is somewhat
irrelevant

04:38:39.269 --> 04:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
irrelevant
 
04:38:39.279 --> 04:38:42.070 align:start position:0%
irrelevant
and

04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:44.551 --> 04:38:44.561 align:start position:0%
coming in on page 48 i doubt that it's
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
the general introduction of a lot of
 
04:38:47.680 --> 04:38:48.551 align:start position:0%
the general introduction of a lot of
people

04:38:48.551 --> 04:38:48.561 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative phillips
 
04:38:53.750 --> 04:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:53.760 --> 04:38:54.709 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
hold on
 
04:38:57.670 --> 04:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
i have a
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
unstable connection so i shut off the
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
video um i'm i'm not in support of this
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
either with or with without the
 
04:39:05.520 --> 04:39:06.789 align:start position:0%
either with or with without the
amendment

04:39:06.789 --> 04:39:06.799 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
because i'm concerned that there may be
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
these temporary
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants
 
04:39:15.039 --> 04:39:16.551 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants
they

04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
it only requires that they have
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
worked for a hundred hours and they have
 
04:39:24.390 --> 04:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
made they may have had only one task for
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
that whole time for example maybe their
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
only job was to just feed people help
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
them eat
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
and to be an lna the training has about
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
nine different skills that they're
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to master so i'm concerned with
 
04:39:44.788 --> 04:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
giving them a license when they may have
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
had no experience at all with those
 
04:39:50.470 --> 04:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
other tasks that are part of the job
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
and i also think that the state can help
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
them out by giving them you know
 
04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
covering their tuition
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
to do the classroom part of it and
 
04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know some kind of assessment and
 
04:40:03.910 --> 04:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
just fill them in on the skills that
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
they need i mean
 
04:40:07.110 --> 04:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
i like the idea of giving them the
 
04:40:07.120 --> 04:40:08.470 align:start position:0%
i like the idea of giving them the
opportunity

04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:40:10.470 --> 04:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
to quickly get
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
the lna status but i'm just concerned
 
04:40:16.628 --> 04:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
the of the quality of what will happen
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
if this if this is the way we go about
 
04:40:21.600 --> 04:40:22.788 align:start position:0%
if this if this is the way we go about
it

04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:40:26.310 --> 04:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your thought now
 
04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam j well i i would be
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
inclined to agree with representative
 
04:40:30.718 --> 04:40:32.230 align:start position:0%
inclined to agree with representative
fellows

04:40:32.230 --> 04:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
if it were not for the statement of
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
purpose uh being in there i think the
 
04:40:39.030 --> 04:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose explains
 
04:40:41.110 --> 04:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
why we're taking this
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
kind of unusual action to
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
to license these people that stepped in
 
04:40:46.390 --> 04:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
and helped
 
04:40:48.390 --> 04:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and they and it's
 
04:40:48.400 --> 04:40:49.670 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and they and it's
like

04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:40:51.990 --> 04:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's a one-time uh
 
04:40:54.310 --> 04:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a one-time action i think to to
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
do this because it had to happen prior
 
04:41:00.150 --> 04:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
to april 1st so
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'm inclined to support it if the
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman i i agree with
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
that senator fontenot purpose gives it
 
04:41:17.110 --> 04:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
clarification why we're doing it i would
 
04:41:18.948 --> 04:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
also point out that
 
04:41:21.270 --> 04:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know anyone hiring anyone who's
 
04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
licensed under this chapter
 
04:41:26.070 --> 04:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
will have their resume they'll see their
 
04:41:28.788 --> 04:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh you know education and bona fides for
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
the job
 
04:41:31.990 --> 04:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
so if they feel like that the
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
experience they have doesn't qualify
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
them for the job they're applying for
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're free not to hire them so i i
 
04:41:39.990 --> 04:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
feel like it's transparent enough that
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
anyone making a choice to hire someone
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's licensed in this section
 
04:41:44.948 --> 04:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
will be able to know what they're
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
getting so i i support the bill
 
04:41:52.150 --> 04:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i i agree with
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um as you read
 
04:41:56.560 --> 04:41:57.590 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um as you read
this

04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:41:59.910 --> 04:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
it says that the person has worked no
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
fewer than 100 hours as a temporary
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
health partner but it doesn't define
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
what skills they should have done or
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
what they have worked done for work in
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
those hundred hours
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
those hundred hours like she say could
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
have been just um
 
04:42:15.510 --> 04:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
taking care of the meals or delivering
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
meals and making sure these people are
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
getting breakfast lunch and dinner um
 
04:42:21.430 --> 04:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
and then if you look further it says
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
temporary health partner
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
definition means anyone authorized to
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
work in a nursing home by emergency
 
04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
order 42
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
and required to complete training no
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
less than eight hours only eight hours
 
04:42:33.510 --> 04:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
of training and working under the
 
04:42:36.948 --> 04:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
supervision of an rn aprn or lpn so
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
those other 92 hours are working doing
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
no definition of what
 
04:42:45.430 --> 04:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
that entails um so i do have an issue
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
with that so i can't support this
 
04:42:48.240 --> 04:42:53.030 align:start position:0%
with that so i can't support this
okay

04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i just wanted
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
to respond respectfully to what
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative roy said
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
that um my
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
the way i look at it i think that if
 
04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
somebody applies for a job as an lna
 
04:43:10.390 --> 04:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
and it says and they show that they have
 
04:43:13.830 --> 04:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
an lna certification with a you know
 
04:43:13.840 --> 04:43:14.788 align:start position:0%
an lna certification with a you know
number

04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:43:14.798 --> 04:43:15.590 align:start position:0%
number
that

04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:18.310 --> 04:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
um the employer is going to assume that
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
they have all the skills that lna's
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
received training for which may not be
 
04:43:27.030 --> 04:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
a correct assumption for these people
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
under this
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
program the way it's put
 
04:43:31.120 --> 04:43:32.628 align:start position:0%
program the way it's put
okay together

04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
okay together
 
04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
i think we're
 
04:43:36.868 --> 04:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
diverging from the question of the
 
04:43:36.878 --> 04:43:38.628 align:start position:0%
diverging from the question of the
amendment

04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:43:38.638 --> 04:43:40.230 align:start position:0%
amendment

04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%

pearson
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
i guess i guess i have a question in in
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
reference to that this is all
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%

new hampshire does that
 
04:44:01.350 --> 04:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
require i believe it does
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear the question could it be
 
04:44:03.360 --> 04:44:04.230 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear the question could it be
please

04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:44:07.510 --> 04:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
if an a required an exam i believe it
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
does so if it requires an exam it should
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
show competency in
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%

representative fellowes still wishes
well

04:44:27.990 --> 04:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:44:30.310 --> 04:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
04:44:32.550 --> 04:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
04:44:36.150 --> 04:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
either the bill or the amendment that um
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
these people are not going to take the
 
04:44:38.240 --> 04:44:40.070 align:start position:0%
these people are not going to take the
exam

04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
exam
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
why not
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
it says why would they apply for a
 
04:44:43.760 --> 04:44:45.590 align:start position:0%
it says why would they apply for a
license

04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that they're that they
 
04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're only being
 
04:44:50.400 --> 04:44:51.670 align:start position:0%
they're only being
granted

04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
granted
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
a board certified approved nursing
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
assistant course
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
so they're
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
they still have to meet the other
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
requirements of the license
 
04:45:02.480 --> 04:45:04.390 align:start position:0%
requirements of the license
well

04:45:04.390 --> 04:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:45:06.868 --> 04:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
do they be given a license as they may
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
apply for a license well
 
04:45:13.350 --> 04:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
don't they take the take the exam to be
 
04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
able to get the certificate from
 
04:45:18.868 --> 04:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
whomever they took the course from
 
04:45:22.070 --> 04:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
when we did the emt equivalent bill we
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
covered it there they have to take the
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
exam and then
 
04:45:29.430 --> 04:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
so not even in that case not necessarily
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
they have to take the test
 
04:45:35.830 --> 04:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
well can we ask can we ask oplc do they
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
take the exam after they pass the course
 
04:45:38.878 --> 04:45:39.910 align:start position:0%
take the exam after they pass the course
or

04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
before they get the license or do they
 
04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
have to pass take the exam before they
 
04:45:44.798 --> 04:45:45.910 align:start position:0%
have to pass take the exam before they
get

04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:45:45.920 --> 04:45:49.110 align:start position:0%
get
the

04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.270 --> 04:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
credit for the course
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%

04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%

04:45:59.110 --> 04:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry can you repeat the question
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
this says that they may apply for a
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
license the question is do they take the
 
04:46:09.590 --> 04:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
qualifying exam
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
do they still take the qualifying exam
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.520 --> 04:46:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
some oversight with regard to the
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
stratfor county nursing home
 
04:48:03.670 --> 04:48:03.680 align:start position:0%

04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
who've
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
been in nursing homes where i visited

them on a weekly basis
 
04:48:12.310 --> 04:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh so i've seen this a lot of this and
 
04:48:13.750 --> 04:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
the reality is
 
04:48:13.760 --> 04:48:15.430 align:start position:0%
the reality is
that

04:48:15.430 --> 04:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:15.440 --> 04:48:17.190 align:start position:0%
that
that

04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%

04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants we call them
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
lnas some states don't even license them
 
04:48:30.150 --> 04:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
but the these are all tasks that need to
 
04:48:31.110 --> 04:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
be done
 
04:48:33.910 --> 04:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay and if they don't have nursing uh
 
04:48:33.920 --> 04:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
okay and if they don't have nursing uh
lnas

04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
lnas
 
04:48:35.040 --> 04:48:35.830 align:start position:0%
lnas
uh

04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:37.590 --> 04:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
in our nursing homes
 
04:48:40.628 --> 04:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh to feed to to change
 
04:48:41.400 --> 04:48:41.410 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
04:48:41.410 --> 04:48:43.110 align:start position:0%
uh to
[Music]

04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:48:43.120 --> 04:48:44.230 align:start position:0%
[Music]
do

04:48:44.230 --> 04:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:48:45.990 --> 04:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
laundry or whatever
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
then they have to have
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
those are services that have to be
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
provided and if they're not provided by
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
lnas and they have to be provided by our
 
04:48:56.550 --> 04:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
ends and in when you have critical
 
04:48:56.560 --> 04:48:58.390 align:start position:0%
ends and in when you have critical
nursing

04:48:58.390 --> 04:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
critical service
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
shortages which is what the
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
the purpose statement says that's why
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
post taking it out
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
if you don't have
 
04:49:10.708 --> 04:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh those services provided
 
04:49:12.788 --> 04:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
these nursing homes all have ratio
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
requirements they don't have enough
 
04:49:16.390 --> 04:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
people doing the doing the various
 
04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
different tasks especially
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh rns and so forth and more skilled
 
04:49:24.070 --> 04:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
positions then they can't operate the
 
04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
section but the people are there they
 
04:49:29.110 --> 04:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
need the services and their shortages
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
critical shortages that's why this is a
 
04:49:34.070 --> 04:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
temporary measure
 
04:49:34.080 --> 04:49:34.948 align:start position:0%
temporary measure
to

04:49:34.948 --> 04:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:49:37.590 --> 04:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
help get people in and if all they're
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
doing is feeding people then that's all
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
they're doing but if there's nobody
 
04:49:44.550 --> 04:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
doing it then an rn is going to have to
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
do it
 
04:49:45.520 --> 04:49:46.788 align:start position:0%
do it
so

04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
this is a pandemic where they have
 
04:49:48.958 --> 04:49:50.550 align:start position:0%
this is a pandemic where they have
shortfalls

04:49:50.550 --> 04:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
shortfalls
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
this is a temporary measure where you
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
have to you know
 
04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is a dog-eat-dog situation and
 
04:50:00.550 --> 04:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
these nursing homes are in desperate
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
need in many cases of staff
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm supporting both
 
04:50:08.310 --> 04:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment and also the purpose
 
04:50:08.320 --> 04:50:09.510 align:start position:0%
the amendment and also the purpose
statement

04:50:09.510 --> 04:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
statement
 
04:50:09.520 --> 04:50:10.390 align:start position:0%
statement
because

04:50:10.390 --> 04:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
these people are in dire need
 
04:50:20.470 --> 04:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
on the shoulders of uh representative
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
schmidt and scitec for something that
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're just saying
 
04:50:29.430 --> 04:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
they are critical needs and
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh i feel like we're
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
as representative scitec said on a
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
different subject before i feel like
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
we're debating the federalist papers
 
04:50:36.718 --> 04:50:37.910 align:start position:0%
we're debating the federalist papers
here

04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
i also have served in the nursing
 
04:50:42.070 --> 04:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and performed some of
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
these tasks myself and i'm not trying to
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
be facetious or make light lighter
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
but the truth of the matter is we're
 
04:50:48.628 --> 04:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:50:50.550 --> 04:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
putting a spoon to someone's mouth we're
 
04:50:52.150 --> 04:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:50:54.390 --> 04:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh cleaning their their bottoms
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
afterwards i don't remember all of the
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
skills that were listed in one of these
 
04:51:00.070 --> 04:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
documents but the others that i recall
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
were helping somebody walk helping
 
04:51:04.550 --> 04:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
somebody sit helping somebody stand
 
04:51:06.150 --> 04:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
these don't seem to be
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're critical
 
04:51:08.788 --> 04:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
they're critical
 
04:51:11.990 --> 04:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
but they're not exactly uh
 
04:51:14.470 --> 04:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
high-level skills that can't be
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
learned quickly on the jobs
 
04:51:18.310 --> 04:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to support both the
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
amendment and the bill
 
04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative amen
 
04:51:23.920 --> 04:51:24.948 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative amen
so

04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:27.910 --> 04:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
i i agree with representative allegro in
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
terms of like what some of those skills
 
04:51:32.230 --> 04:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
are and that they can be learned fairly
 
04:51:36.150 --> 04:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
quickly i'm just concerned that the
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
temporary worker who
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
the only task they ever had was feeding
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
people doesn't know how to properly help
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
somebody stand up or to roll them over
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
in bed because these can be very frail
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
people and you can you can
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
do damage if you don't
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
help them in the correct way
 
04:51:59.830 --> 04:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it'll take a long time
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm just um very concerned about
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
just broad brushing this
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um since we're waiting for an
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
answer from mr broderick i would just
 
04:52:16.230 --> 04:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
reiterate that and i know representative
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
fellows didn't agree with me but um i've
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
done some hiring and firing in my day
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
and i don't just look at their license
 
04:52:23.910 --> 04:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
or i look at where they've worked and
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
their experience in life and on the job
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
so if i needed a specific task i would
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
make sure they had experience now other
 
04:52:35.350 --> 04:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
than just the licensure and the class
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
to the contrary these people actually
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
have work experience versus someone who
 
04:52:41.430 --> 04:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
just took the class who doesn't so
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully the test will will uh
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
alleviate this question but if it
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't i would still suggest that the
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
people with the practical experience uh
 
04:52:50.788 --> 04:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
actually have a leg up possibly over the
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
people who just took course
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
so um and and to reiterate
 
04:52:57.430 --> 04:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative schultz said
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
um you know desperate times desperate
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
measures we need people in there to help
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
these folks
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
and us saying you know you can't do it
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
without this course does not make any
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
difference at all to the elderly person
 
04:53:12.070 --> 04:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
who needs help bathing and getting fed
 
04:53:14.070 --> 04:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
um we see this in many professions
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
across many agencies uh personally i can
 
04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
speak you know i know the military their
 
04:53:21.270 --> 04:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
their enlistment criteria goes up and
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
down based on you know the need of the
 
04:53:23.440 --> 04:53:24.788 align:start position:0%
down based on you know the need of the
service

04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you have to put the need
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
of the service above what the ideal
 
04:53:30.230 --> 04:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:53:33.270 --> 04:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's not ideal but we need these people
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
and if we can safely put them into into
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
work um i suggest that we do so
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make two two quick points
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
one we are not accepting these people
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
from the continuing continuing education
 
04:53:46.320 --> 04:53:47.510 align:start position:0%
from the continuing continuing education
requirements

04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
for lnas which do exist
 
04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
and they will these people may get the
 
04:53:54.788 --> 04:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
license more quickly but they are
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
required to maintain their competence
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
and secondly it is a one-time event
 
04:54:02.550 --> 04:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's only people that have already
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
served more than 100 hours
 
04:54:08.070 --> 04:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
even if they only had 99 hours by april
 
04:54:10.150 --> 04:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
1st they wouldn't have qualified
 
04:54:14.830 --> 04:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair i just wanted to
 
04:54:20.480 --> 04:54:21.590 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair i just wanted to
um

04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:24.708 --> 04:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
what you said essentially
 
04:54:26.230 --> 04:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
summarizes what i was thinking is that
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't get this particular clause
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
04:54:34.310 --> 04:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
mixed up with the
 
04:54:34.320 --> 04:54:35.350 align:start position:0%
mixed up with the
clause

04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
clause
 
04:54:39.430 --> 04:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
in house on senate bill 155 which
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
is broader than this particular section
 
04:54:45.670 --> 04:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 133
 
04:54:48.708 --> 04:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
my comment about the the purpose in and
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
the medicaid
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
is that when we refer to
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
the suspect
 
04:54:57.270 --> 04:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
sustainability of medical or medicaid
 
04:54:59.590 --> 04:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
services provided nursing home
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
what the what it says to me and most
 
04:55:04.868 --> 04:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
people who would be able to
 
04:55:04.878 --> 04:55:06.230 align:start position:0%
people who would be able to
comprehend

04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
comprehend
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
english reading is that this has to do
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:55:13.590 --> 04:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
facilities that
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
provide medicare so if we just got
 
04:55:20.070 --> 04:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid medicaid sorry so if we just
 
04:55:23.040 --> 04:55:23.990 align:start position:0%
medicaid medicaid sorry so if we just
say

04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
that you just take that word out because
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
it is we're not going to limit it to
 
04:55:31.110 --> 04:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
nursing homes that provide medicaid
 
04:55:32.948 --> 04:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
where this is for all nursing homes
 
04:55:32.958 --> 04:55:34.708 align:start position:0%
where this is for all nursing homes
correct

04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:55:38.830 --> 04:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
it's also it's for all employers of
 
04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
lnas whether they work in a nursing home
 
04:55:45.350 --> 04:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
that provides medicaid or not
 
04:55:45.360 --> 04:55:46.390 align:start position:0%
that provides medicaid or not
correct

04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
so if we just say
 
04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
the general court acknowledges the
 
04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
critical importance of ensuring the
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
quality accessibility and sustainability
 
04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
provided in nursing homes and recognizes
 
04:55:59.910 --> 04:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
the critical storage of licensed nursing
 
04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
assistants that's all
 
04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
because i think if we put the word
 
04:56:05.590 --> 04:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
medicaid in
 
04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
it will
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
limit those facilities that provide
 
04:56:09.600 --> 04:56:11.190 align:start position:0%
limit those facilities that provide
medicaid

04:56:11.190 --> 04:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
04:56:11.200 --> 04:56:12.070 align:start position:0%
medicaid
well

04:56:12.070 --> 04:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
actually represent broda that may have
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
been the
 
04:56:18.310 --> 04:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
facilities that hired these temporary
 
04:56:18.320 --> 04:56:19.350 align:start position:0%
facilities that hired these temporary
partners

04:56:19.350 --> 04:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
partners
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're only dealing with the people who
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
have already served as temporary health
 
04:56:26.470 --> 04:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
partners okay
 
04:56:28.868 --> 04:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
okay i understand i withdraw my request
 
04:56:31.270 --> 04:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you

04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
can i um comment madam chairman yes
 
04:56:41.110 --> 04:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
please i i know that i haven't been in
 
04:56:42.948 --> 04:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
um you know listen to every word because
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
i've been running around a little bit
 
04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
but i don't know if you discussed that
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
just the
 
04:56:48.080 --> 04:56:48.948 align:start position:0%
just the
the

04:56:48.948 --> 04:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:52.230 --> 04:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
grammatical sense of of the paragraph
 
04:56:54.310 --> 04:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
one that is amended by the the new
 
04:56:57.590 --> 04:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
language it does i believe that after
 
04:56:57.600 --> 04:56:59.430 align:start position:0%
language it does i believe that after
2021

04:56:59.430 --> 04:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
2021
 
04:57:03.270 --> 04:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think it should be having demonstrated
 
04:57:06.070 --> 04:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay and then just reading the full sent
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
it's all one long sentence now i think
 
04:57:10.390 --> 04:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
that helps
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
um but persons who have worked no fewer
 
04:57:14.948 --> 04:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
than 100 hours as temporary health
 
04:57:18.150 --> 04:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
partners at a licensed nursing home
 
04:57:20.390 --> 04:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
by april 21st have demonstrated their
 
04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
work experience during a national and
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
state public health emergency the
 
04:57:26.708 --> 04:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
competency to transition to status as a
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.550 --> 04:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
it seems like a new sentence needs to
 
04:57:32.560 --> 04:57:35.430 align:start position:0%
it seems like a new sentence needs to
start

04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
there i would be delighted if you would
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
when putting the final amendment
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
together you
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
clean up okay in such a way the
 
04:57:45.990 --> 04:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
important point is that this shall be
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
deemed to have taken a board approved
 
04:57:50.150 --> 04:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant course
 
04:57:50.160 --> 04:57:51.590 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant course
right

04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:57:53.590 --> 04:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
so yes please uh
 
04:57:55.270 --> 04:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
i noticed that myself when i read the
 
04:57:56.550 --> 04:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
04:57:58.628 --> 04:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
the grammar was
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
right and this the sense is is clear
 
04:58:04.470 --> 04:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's so um great i just wanted to
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
point that out and i see if you had
 
04:58:07.510 --> 04:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
talked about it
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to
 
04:58:10.788 --> 04:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
add some words in there
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we haven't actually talked about it
 
04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't i would agree that the
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
grant it doesn't appear to be very
 
04:58:20.470 --> 04:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
dramatic representative font now
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i just that thank you madam chair i
 
04:58:24.550 --> 04:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reiterate you know i
 
04:58:27.510 --> 04:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
think most know that i am a proponent of
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
licensing and i just think that the
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
reason this particular
 
04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
bill is worthy is because we are
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that these temporary
 
04:58:40.470 --> 04:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
health partners stepped up to the plate
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
during the time that many people retired
 
04:58:46.708 --> 04:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
early from nursing homes and and took
 
04:58:48.788 --> 04:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
leaves from their jobs at nursing homes
 
04:58:50.070 --> 04:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want to be there
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and these people
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
stepped in and did a job that a lot of
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
other people didn't want to do so i
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
think that's why we're
 
04:58:58.310 --> 04:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:58:59.990 --> 04:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're stepping aside as some of the
 
04:59:00.000 --> 04:59:00.948 align:start position:0%
we're stepping aside as some of the
usual

04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
usual
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
requirements and saying you guys deserve
 
04:59:03.760 --> 04:59:04.868 align:start position:0%
requirements and saying you guys deserve
um

04:59:04.868 --> 04:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:05.830 --> 04:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
to move forward in this profession if
 
04:59:10.868 --> 04:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
you so choose
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
thank you good point
 
04:59:15.190 --> 04:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
other comments questions
 
04:59:17.430 --> 04:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
very quickly uh
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
about the hundred hours being one
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
particular test i don't think any of
 
04:59:23.590 --> 04:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
these if you have to work 2 000 hours
 
04:59:26.708 --> 04:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
and then something specified spectrum of
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
what you do on that job you could do
 
04:59:29.040 --> 04:59:30.550 align:start position:0%
what you do on that job you could do
just

04:59:30.550 --> 04:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
a 14 gauge romex and never touch
 
04:59:36.550 --> 04:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:39.030 --> 04:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's true
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
the idea the expectation is if you're
 
04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
there that long you'll uh do a little
 
04:59:45.990 --> 04:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
bit of everything which i think is
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
is pretty reasonable
 
04:59:47.840 --> 04:59:49.270 align:start position:0%
is pretty reasonable
especially

04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
especially
 
04:59:51.190 --> 04:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
particularly if they're short-handed yes
 
04:59:55.910 --> 04:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.920 --> 05:00:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:00:02.550 --> 05:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:14.070 --> 05:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:15.510 --> 05:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
texting back and forth with
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative schultz uh her computer
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
is kind of going in and out so when you
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
get to her to vote if
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
her computer has died she has her cell
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
phone ready to cue back in
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay that's very very well prepared of
 
05:00:36.150 --> 05:00:36.160 align:start position:0%

which is
 
05:02:57.600 --> 05:02:58.550 align:start position:0%
which is
um

05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's of two parts one
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh which we actually was representative
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
gaul's idea during the subcommittee
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
which is to delete change the effective
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
date to immediately upon passage because
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
right so that to change the effective
 
05:03:18.708 --> 05:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
date to on passage okay
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
and the second one which i also
 
05:03:22.310 --> 05:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned during the subcommittee uh
 
05:03:25.030 --> 05:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
take out the april first
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
date in
 
05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
title i section one
 
05:03:29.680 --> 05:03:31.030 align:start position:0%
title i section one
because

05:03:31.030 --> 05:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:03:33.270 --> 05:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's kind of superfluous and it's
 
05:03:33.280 --> 05:03:35.670 align:start position:0%
it's kind of superfluous and it's
unnecessary

05:03:35.670 --> 05:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
05:03:36.868 --> 05:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
the temporary health partners are
 
05:03:39.750 --> 05:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
already defined as somebody
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
who falls under the emergency order 42
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
so while we're still in the middle of
 
05:03:44.400 --> 05:03:45.510 align:start position:0%
so while we're still in the middle of
pandemic

05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
on the battlefield like mr clark
 
05:03:47.360 --> 05:03:48.550 align:start position:0%
on the battlefield like mr clark
described

05:03:48.550 --> 05:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
described
 
05:03:50.550 --> 05:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic battlefield
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
we should just simplify this bill and
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
make it rely on the emergency order 42
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
so i'm just suggesting removing april
 
05:04:03.510 --> 05:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
1st 2021 and i ran it by the sponsor of
 
05:04:05.190 --> 05:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
this bill and she agreed
 
05:04:07.030 --> 05:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea right so that you're
 
05:04:10.150 --> 05:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
ah so it's
 
05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:16.638 --> 05:04:26.628 align:start position:0%
 
correct

05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:28.150 --> 05:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
instead of the date it will say the
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
ending of the emergency order you don't
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
even need to because uh temporary health
 
05:04:36.310 --> 05:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
partners will end up on the end ending
 
05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
the order being rescinded okay that's
 
05:04:40.948 --> 05:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
interesting is there a second
 
05:04:40.958 --> 05:04:42.150 align:start position:0%
interesting is there a second
second

05:04:42.150 --> 05:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i guess i already spoke about
 
05:04:51.430 --> 05:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
it so that's fine you already spoke
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:57.990 --> 05:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
i do not
 
05:04:58.000 --> 05:04:59.030 align:start position:0%
i do not
okay

05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:00.390 --> 05:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
05:05:03.750 --> 05:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
on this additional change
 
05:05:09.190 --> 05:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
was that further amendment further
 
05:05:09.200 --> 05:05:15.190 align:start position:0%
was that further amendment further

05:05:19.030 --> 05:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
so this this would allow people who

section
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
it is relative to the revocation of

05:10:34.160 --> 05:10:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:10:35.270 --> 05:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
this will simplify
 
05:10:41.350 --> 05:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:45.030 --> 05:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
for ems units
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
not licensing but any any questions
 
05:10:51.030 --> 05:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
about the license any violation of the
 
05:10:51.040 --> 05:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
about the license any violation of the
license

05:10:52.470 --> 05:10:52.480 align:start position:0%

05:10:56.160 --> 05:10:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
something

05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:11:00.070 --> 05:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean this is this is uh
 
05:11:02.310 --> 05:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
this allows for discretion and i think
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
that uh you know when we we have to be
 
05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
careful in statute when we use
 
05:11:10.390 --> 05:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
the word shall in may and
 
05:11:13.110 --> 05:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
all those things and i think that
 
05:11:15.430 --> 05:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is uh this allows for the
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
questions comments or
 
05:11:23.600 --> 05:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
questions comments or
concerns

05:11:26.550 --> 05:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
is there a way of making
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
05:11:34.070 --> 05:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
can somebody get give me a summary of
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
i don't i really didn't
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
get this the uh a good
 
05:11:47.510 --> 05:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
summary of what this
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
section is about and why we should
 
05:11:53.670 --> 05:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.680 --> 05:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:11:55.840 --> 05:11:55.850 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:55.850 --> 05:12:03.750 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

05:12:03.750 --> 05:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:06.788 --> 05:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
well i'll give you my interpretation
 
05:12:07.830 --> 05:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:12:07.840 --> 05:12:09.430 align:start position:0%
right now
the

05:12:09.430 --> 05:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner can only
 
05:12:11.920 --> 05:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner can only
susp

05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
susp
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
deny an application for suspend or
 
05:12:17.910 --> 05:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
revocable license
 
05:12:19.590 --> 05:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
for any
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
acts or offenses even if they have
 
05:12:25.110 --> 05:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
already been corrected
 
05:12:27.670 --> 05:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
or worked
 
05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
so in this case this allows the
 
05:12:33.190 --> 05:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner a less extreme
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
punishment that is to issue a formal
 
05:12:38.868 --> 05:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:41.750 --> 05:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
that will not suspend or revoke the
 
05:12:41.760 --> 05:12:43.590 align:start position:0%
that will not suspend or revoke the
license

05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:12:43.600 --> 05:12:44.310 align:start position:0%
license
right

05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:12:47.270 --> 05:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.280 --> 05:12:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:12:48.320 --> 05:12:49.110 align:start position:0%
yeah
yep

05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
yep
 
05:12:50.550 --> 05:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
like i said it allows for some
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
discretion here um
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
within the context and circumstance of
 
05:12:58.230 --> 05:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:58.240 --> 05:12:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
and represent pearson can correct me but
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
my take is that another
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
potential benefit is if the only choice
 
05:13:08.400 --> 05:13:09.590 align:start position:0%
potential benefit is if the only choice
presented

05:13:09.590 --> 05:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
presented
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
is no action or take drastic action
 
05:13:15.910 --> 05:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
such as revoking someone's license
 
05:13:18.310 --> 05:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
there might be a tendency
 
05:13:18.320 --> 05:13:19.270 align:start position:0%
there might be a tendency
to

05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:13:21.430 --> 05:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
not take action in situations where
 
05:13:23.110 --> 05:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
short of revoking a license would
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
actually be helpful
 
05:13:30.310 --> 05:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
and so this might actually contribute to
 
05:13:35.830 --> 05:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
yes but on the other hand
 
05:13:39.200 --> 05:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
yes but on the other hand
if

05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
they may
 
05:13:46.470 --> 05:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
then nothing might happen
 
05:13:49.590 --> 05:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
so i i i understand the issue issue a
 
05:13:52.628 --> 05:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
letter of concern i agree with that
 
05:13:54.550 --> 05:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
but i don't agree with the changing of
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
the word from michelle to may
 
05:13:59.350 --> 05:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
because then the commissioner may not do
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
anything and some of these
 
05:14:01.920 --> 05:14:06.390 align:start position:0%
anything and some of these
um

05:14:06.390 --> 05:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:08.150 --> 05:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
some of these offenses
 
05:14:11.590 --> 05:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:12.788 --> 05:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
05:14:12.798 --> 05:14:14.470 align:start position:0%
that's correct
representative

05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:14:17.670 --> 05:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh to speak to representative
 
05:14:21.030 --> 05:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
pearsons uh or your concern
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
that's what he can do now
 
05:14:24.788 --> 05:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
he may say that in the interests of
 
05:14:26.550 --> 05:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
overall justice i'm just going to look
 
05:14:28.150 --> 05:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
the other way and who's going to do
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:31.440 --> 05:14:37.350 align:start position:0%
 
exactly

05:14:37.350 --> 05:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean
 
05:14:40.150 --> 05:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
the problem in any of those kind of
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
things is um
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know if there's some situations
 
05:14:45.830 --> 05:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
where you'd like to see them
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
revoke a license and others to
 
05:14:50.788 --> 05:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
to issue the letter of concern or
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
something left
 
05:14:54.230 --> 05:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you can do that without
 
05:14:55.990 --> 05:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
leaving it to the discretion of the
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
person making the decision because i
 
05:14:58.550 --> 05:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
05:15:00.868 --> 05:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
how we can draw some bright lying in
 
05:15:02.788 --> 05:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
statute as to
 
05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
exactly when one is appropriate or the
 
05:15:05.910 --> 05:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
other is
 
05:15:07.270 --> 05:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
and yeah there's always the risk when
 
05:15:08.708 --> 05:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
there's discretion
 
05:15:10.070 --> 05:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
that somebody's going to make a bad
 
05:15:10.080 --> 05:15:11.110 align:start position:0%
that somebody's going to make a bad
decision

05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:15:11.120 --> 05:15:12.230 align:start position:0%
decision
but

05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's kind of as was said that's the way
 
05:15:16.310 --> 05:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
it is today also there's always pro in
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
effect it's
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial discretion
 
05:15:21.270 --> 05:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
which is there uh you know in this
 
05:15:23.190 --> 05:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
situation as well as a
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know the d.a or something
 
05:15:30.708 --> 05:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
so so also too so for those of you that
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
that may not have looked up the sighting
 
05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
of this right because it talks about rsa
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
153 813 153 a13
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
has that lovely part of statute that we
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
call knowingly does x
 
05:15:49.510 --> 05:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
and knowingly
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
is difficult and just in the nature of
 
05:15:53.040 --> 05:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
is difficult and just in the nature of
of

05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:15:55.750 --> 05:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
having knowingly gives or knowingly
 
05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
causes or knowingly does
 
05:16:00.390 --> 05:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
that lends itself to discretion because
 
05:16:02.550 --> 05:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
you're sometimes you know how do you
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
definitively come up with knowingly
 
05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
so this this allows the circumstances in
 
05:16:13.030 --> 05:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the you know the commissioner to
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
to use their judgment in the question
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
so it's gonna be an official id school
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
idea i guess is not good
 
05:16:22.320 --> 05:16:23.270 align:start position:0%
idea i guess is not good
terry

05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
terry
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
oh he just knew himself okay
 
05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
so go ahead
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
so i mean i'm back
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
yourself thanks no
 
05:16:32.550 --> 05:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
but but if you if you if you guys can
 
05:16:34.868 --> 05:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
understand what i'm what i'm what i'm
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
saying here you know that the the
 
05:16:38.550 --> 05:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
section that's referenced involves you
 
05:16:38.560 --> 05:16:39.430 align:start position:0%
section that's referenced involves you
know

05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
knowingly gives their causes to give or
 
05:16:44.310 --> 05:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
knowing knowingly gives or causes to be
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
that that lends itself to the need for
 
05:16:47.670 --> 05:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
discretion and i think that this simple
 
05:16:52.150 --> 05:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:52.160 --> 05:16:54.948 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:17:00.628 --> 05:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.270 --> 05:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay represent fellows
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to say that that that
 
05:17:05.840 --> 05:17:06.550 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to say that that that
i

05:17:06.550 --> 05:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative pearson
 
05:17:10.310 --> 05:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
telling us that because it then it all
 
05:17:12.628 --> 05:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense so somebody does
 
05:17:13.910 --> 05:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
something that they really shouldn't
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
have done
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
and this is a whole list of
 
05:17:20.470 --> 05:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
the possible reactions to that situation
 
05:17:22.390 --> 05:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
and the new option of
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
letter of concern that's just like in a
 
05:17:27.670 --> 05:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
business when you put put a letter you
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
know a note in somebody's personnel file
 
05:17:32.788 --> 05:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
or when or when a police officer gives
 
05:17:35.030 --> 05:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
you a warning for speeding
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
that goes on the record so if you do it
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
again you're going to be in big trouble
 
05:17:40.150 --> 05:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
05:17:42.390 --> 05:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
not going overboard if it just happens
 
05:17:42.400 --> 05:17:43.910 align:start position:0%
not going overboard if it just happens
once

05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
once
 
05:17:43.920 --> 05:17:45.270 align:start position:0%

all right seeing none
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%

that's the wrong one 11 is on page 49
 
05:20:22.390 --> 05:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:24.310 --> 05:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:20:28.628 --> 05:20:28.638 align:start position:0%
yeah hang on i apologize for not being
 
05:20:32.550 --> 05:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
as organized as i should be
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
and having the amendments and hands
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
which madam chair
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
would miriam have sent us the amendment
 
05:20:42.628 --> 05:20:42.638 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
05:20:44.788 --> 05:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
i it should have been
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
ms marling if you could perhaps resend
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
to those
 
05:20:48.240 --> 05:20:49.110 align:start position:0%
to those
sure

05:20:49.110 --> 05:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:20:51.670 --> 05:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
i can uh i can describe the change i
 
05:20:53.590 --> 05:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
05:20:55.910 --> 05:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
reasonably uh
 
05:20:59.750 --> 05:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
easily so the issue was that
 
05:21:03.990 --> 05:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
part 11 among other things uh changes
 
05:21:08.150 --> 05:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
um the apprentice from being a licensed
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
to a certificate
 
05:21:13.670 --> 05:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
and the changes for the part of the uh
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
rsas that it specifically is dealing
 
05:21:18.390 --> 05:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
with there makes that change however
 
05:21:21.070 --> 05:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
there's also rsa
 
05:21:23.670 --> 05:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
313-820 which deals with
 
05:21:26.708 --> 05:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
expiration renewal of licenses
 
05:21:28.628 --> 05:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh just calls them licenses and deals
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
with them all as a block including um
 
05:21:33.910 --> 05:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know the apprentice what we're now
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
going to be calling apprentice
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
certificate and so the amendment just
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
changes uh
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
mainly it changes 3 13 20
 
05:21:44.230 --> 05:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
to um
 
05:21:46.310 --> 05:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
split it up and deal with the licenses
 
05:21:47.990 --> 05:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
as licenses and certificates
 
05:21:48.000 --> 05:21:49.350 align:start position:0%
as licenses and certificates
certificates

05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not ambiguous as far as the
 
05:21:53.670 --> 05:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
language goes the other thing it does
 
05:21:56.070 --> 05:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
is we were bringing in uh the changes
 
05:21:56.080 --> 05:21:57.750 align:start position:0%
is we were bringing in uh the changes
from

05:21:57.750 --> 05:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
05:22:04.230 --> 05:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
carol what was it fives house bill 5.75
 
05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
right house bill 575. so
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
there was a similar language there which
 
05:22:11.190 --> 05:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh i i'm understanding is carol's
 
05:22:12.708 --> 05:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
arranged for the senate to remove that
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
so there wouldn't be
 
05:22:16.788 --> 05:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
conflicts but when the initial amendment
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
or the initial uh changes were done it
 
05:22:21.670 --> 05:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
left out an important part of it so and
 
05:22:24.788 --> 05:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
that part is in
 
05:22:24.798 --> 05:22:27.510 align:start position:0%
that part is in
um

05:22:27.510 --> 05:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:30.788 --> 05:22:30.798 align:start position:0%
okay on page 50 line 5.
 
05:22:32.470 --> 05:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
for being more organized than i am
 
05:22:36.310 --> 05:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
it changes that where it's within a
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
licensed school or shop to license
 
05:22:41.670 --> 05:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
school and or shop
 
05:22:43.270 --> 05:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
since um
 
05:22:44.708 --> 05:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
you know we're now permitting them to
 
05:22:44.718 --> 05:22:46.150 align:start position:0%
you know we're now permitting them to
receive

05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
receive
 
05:22:49.110 --> 05:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
some of their training um you know
 
05:22:51.910 --> 05:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
in one or the other or a part in one and
 
05:22:53.830 --> 05:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
part in the other so that change allows
 
05:22:56.550 --> 05:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
that to be there as well
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
so that's actually the substantive
 
05:23:00.390 --> 05:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
change and the rest of it is just
 
05:23:01.750 --> 05:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
cleaning up
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know whether something's called
 
05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
referred to as a certificate or a
 
05:23:05.200 --> 05:23:07.510 align:start position:0%
referred to as a certificate or a
license

05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:23:07.520 --> 05:23:08.230 align:start position:0%
license
i

05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:23:11.190 --> 05:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed house bill 575
 
05:23:14.070 --> 05:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
and i have worked out the senate an
 
05:23:14.080 --> 05:23:15.270 align:start position:0%
and i have worked out the senate an
amendment

05:23:15.270 --> 05:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
that deletes
 
05:23:18.550 --> 05:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
their section
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
history that amends
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
rna 313 824
 
05:23:27.670 --> 05:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's the only part of 575 that
 
05:23:30.070 --> 05:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
overlaps with this
 
05:23:36.390 --> 05:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
these the senate will amend house bill
 
05:23:39.120 --> 05:23:40.390 align:start position:0%
these the senate will amend house bill
575

05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
575
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
if they choose to pass it
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:51.590 --> 05:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
a13 a24 does not apply if house bill if
 
05:23:54.868 --> 05:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
senate bill 133 passes that looked like
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
the cleanest way to handle it because
 
05:23:59.830 --> 05:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
the rest of 575
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
is in different sections than this one
 
05:24:02.878 --> 05:24:03.910 align:start position:0%
is in different sections than this one
than

05:24:03.910 --> 05:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 133
 
05:24:07.350 --> 05:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:24:10.948 --> 05:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
question of the hours is only in house
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill 575 this
 
05:24:16.230 --> 05:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 133
 
05:24:19.030 --> 05:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
simply says and a program approved by
 
05:24:20.830 --> 05:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
the board
 
05:24:22.230 --> 05:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
so the
 
05:24:22.240 --> 05:24:24.150 align:start position:0%
so the
[Music]

05:24:24.150 --> 05:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:24:25.830 --> 05:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
this makes
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
makes it compatible and as
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative like i said it also
 
05:24:32.070 --> 05:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
cleans up the reference to a certificate
 
05:24:37.430 --> 05:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:40.708 --> 05:24:40.718 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
05:24:43.510 --> 05:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
05:24:48.390 --> 05:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
so if an apprentice
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
goes through this program
 
05:24:58.868 --> 05:24:58.878 align:start position:0%
then they attain a certificate correct
 
05:24:58.878 --> 05:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
then they attain a certificate correct
no

05:24:59.750 --> 05:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:25:02.310 --> 05:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
they get the certificate when they are
 
05:25:06.310 --> 05:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
going to start working in a
 
05:25:07.990 --> 05:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
a shop
 
05:25:11.110 --> 05:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
the if i may all right
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
or getting getting instructions
 
05:25:16.390 --> 05:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
they have to have a certificate before
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
they can act as an apprentice
 
05:25:21.990 --> 05:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
so they get the certificate first
 
05:25:23.670 --> 05:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
they get some or all of their training
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
through the apprenticeship
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
as part of completing the requirements
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
for the for them to then apply for a
 
05:25:29.520 --> 05:25:31.030 align:start position:0%
for the for them to then apply for a
license

05:25:31.030 --> 05:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:25:32.470 --> 05:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes this
 
05:25:35.830 --> 05:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
it specifically says online
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
page 50 line 4 that the board shall
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
issue the like apprentice certificate to
 
05:25:43.270 --> 05:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
any student receiving instruction
 
05:25:48.708 --> 05:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:50.708 --> 05:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
right and that way the the place that's
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
going to take them on as an apprentice
 
05:25:55.830 --> 05:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
knows that it's it's okay to do so
 
05:25:57.270 --> 05:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
and and the
 
05:25:59.270 --> 05:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the requirements for being for
 
05:26:01.030 --> 05:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
having the certificate is going to be
 
05:26:02.550 --> 05:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
put together by the board and then put
 
05:26:04.310 --> 05:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
in rule making
 
05:26:06.868 --> 05:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
no representative it's in the bill on
 
05:26:10.868 --> 05:26:10.878 align:start position:0%
page 50 line 7 through
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
13. it's
 
05:26:15.670 --> 05:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
16 years old pay the fee
 
05:26:18.070 --> 05:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
and be deemed to be a good professional
 
05:26:18.080 --> 05:26:20.310 align:start position:0%
and be deemed to be a good professional
character

05:26:20.310 --> 05:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
character
 
05:26:20.320 --> 05:26:21.270 align:start position:0%
character
which

05:26:21.270 --> 05:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:26:22.708 --> 05:26:22.718 align:start position:0%
for high school students shouldn't be
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.670 --> 05:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
so basically you're high school student
 
05:26:31.830 --> 05:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
and you want to be
 
05:26:34.070 --> 05:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
an esthetician
 
05:26:37.270 --> 05:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
so you follow these qualifications
 
05:26:40.390 --> 05:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
and then you go work for an esthetician
 
05:26:42.628 --> 05:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
and through that you become you get a
 
05:26:44.470 --> 05:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
license to be an esthetician is that
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
you have to complete the hours specified
 
05:26:50.868 --> 05:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
by the board's rules
 
05:26:52.470 --> 05:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
and you have to take the appropriate
 
05:26:52.480 --> 05:26:56.070 align:start position:0%
and you have to take the appropriate
test

05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.750 --> 05:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
getting the training either as an
 
05:26:59.830 --> 05:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
apprentice or in a school licensed
 
05:26:59.840 --> 05:27:00.948 align:start position:0%
apprentice or in a school licensed
school

05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
is you know that's just one of the
 
05:27:08.070 --> 05:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:09.750 --> 05:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
and why do we think that this is a good
 
05:27:09.760 --> 05:27:11.110 align:start position:0%
and why do we think that this is a good
idea

05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:27:11.120 --> 05:27:11.830 align:start position:0%
idea
the

05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
well for one thing it gives the board
 
05:27:15.270 --> 05:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
specific authority
 
05:27:15.280 --> 05:27:16.230 align:start position:0%
specific authority
to

05:27:16.230 --> 05:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:27:18.628 --> 05:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
regulate apprentice
 
05:27:22.310 --> 05:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
schools of of cosmetology etc in that
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
are within high schools some high
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
schools have them including concord high
 
05:27:30.150 --> 05:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
i believe albert may as well the other
 
05:27:30.160 --> 05:27:31.110 align:start position:0%
i believe albert may as well the other
thing

05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
talking about the section as a whole
 
05:27:34.948 --> 05:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
rather than just the amendment is if you
 
05:27:36.070 --> 05:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
look on
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
page 50 lines 21-23
 
05:27:39.440 --> 05:27:40.310 align:start position:0%
page 50 lines 21-23
um

05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:41.910 --> 05:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
it lets them get the apprentice
 
05:27:41.920 --> 05:27:43.350 align:start position:0%
it lets them get the apprentice
certificate

05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
05:27:44.948 --> 05:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
without requiring the social security
 
05:27:47.110 --> 05:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
number the reason that was done
 
05:27:49.030 --> 05:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
is because of these programs they're in
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
high schools and there's the for the
 
05:27:52.628 --> 05:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
federal uh
 
05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
student privacy laws that said that uh
 
05:27:57.830 --> 05:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
the school can't demand uh a social
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
security number so that's why that
 
05:28:01.110 --> 05:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
change was put in there to actually make
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
it legit to have uh these programs as
 
05:28:05.670 --> 05:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
part of vote tech programs in high
 
05:28:05.680 --> 05:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
part of vote tech programs in high
schools

05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:28:10.868 --> 05:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
meanwhile there's a secondary uh
 
05:28:12.868 --> 05:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
federal requirement that if you're you
 
05:28:15.190 --> 05:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
have a professional license that allows
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
you to work you have to provide your
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
social security number you can make sure
 
05:28:21.590 --> 05:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're paying troubles
 
05:28:24.788 --> 05:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
right so i guess the plan process is uh
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
if someone's at least 16 they're in high
 
05:28:26.718 --> 05:28:27.830 align:start position:0%
if someone's at least 16 they're in high
school

05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:28:30.470 --> 05:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
they get their apprentice certificate
 
05:28:32.230 --> 05:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
and um they don't have to provide the
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
social security number for that
 
05:28:36.708 --> 05:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
they go through that apprenticeship
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
program and schooling
 
05:28:40.470 --> 05:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
within the high school
 
05:28:41.830 --> 05:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen within high school but
 
05:28:43.590 --> 05:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the idea
 
05:28:45.910 --> 05:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
um and then you know they'll be done
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
with school they'll turn 18
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
and then go through the remainder of the
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
process to apply for an actual license
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:56.070 --> 05:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
but kind of give so that way they come
 
05:28:57.910 --> 05:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
out of high school with uh
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
you know the ability to to get a job and
 
05:29:06.470 --> 05:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i was part of
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee and if i remember
 
05:29:10.958 --> 05:29:12.150 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee and if i remember
correctly

05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh the main reasons for these changes
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the apprenticeship programs were
 
05:29:18.000 --> 05:29:19.110 align:start position:0%
in the apprenticeship programs were
for

05:29:19.110 --> 05:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
some of the high schools that had these
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
trade programs associated with them
 
05:29:27.350 --> 05:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
by using the language of a license
 
05:29:29.270 --> 05:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
they were required to give social
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
security numbers and
 
05:29:32.470 --> 05:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
05:29:32.480 --> 05:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
the schools
under

05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:29:35.510 --> 05:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
who are not allowed to give out social
 
05:29:37.510 --> 05:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
security numbers of minors
 
05:29:37.520 --> 05:29:39.270 align:start position:0%
security numbers of minors
and

05:29:39.270 --> 05:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:29:41.750 --> 05:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
someone can correct me if i'm wrong
 
05:29:44.868 --> 05:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
so this was the reason why
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
line 21 was put in 21 through 23 was put
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
in at the bottom and as well as
 
05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
changing the wording from license to
 
05:29:54.548 --> 05:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship to allow these students
 
05:29:54.558 --> 05:29:55.350 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship to allow these students
to

05:29:55.350 --> 05:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:29:57.910 --> 05:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
complete a program while still in school
 
05:29:59.910 --> 05:29:59.920 align:start position:0%

i think we will now take up section

do you wish to speak to your motion
 
05:34:22.830 --> 05:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
05:34:25.830 --> 05:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
briefly um i think with compact our
 
05:34:27.830 --> 05:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
patients will have wider access to
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
providers to
 
05:34:29.840 --> 05:34:30.708 align:start position:0%
providers to
people

05:34:30.708 --> 05:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
in in the medical field that's why i'd
 
05:34:36.150 --> 05:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
like to keep the compact thank you okay
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:41.830 --> 05:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes also uh
 
05:34:41.840 --> 05:34:43.350 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes also uh
briefly

05:34:43.350 --> 05:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
05:34:43.360 --> 05:34:44.230 align:start position:0%
briefly
um

05:34:44.230 --> 05:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:45.590 --> 05:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is different than all the other
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
compacts we're talking about because
 
05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
this is one we're already in
 
05:34:50.708 --> 05:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
this isn't whether or not we should get
 
05:34:53.430 --> 05:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
into it all the legwork has been done by
 
05:34:55.750 --> 05:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
previous legislation
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
all the arguments have been made all the
 
05:35:01.910 --> 05:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
potential outcomes vetted and a decision
 
05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
was made to put us into this compact
 
05:35:07.030 --> 05:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
and although it passed several years ago
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
it just came into effect last year in
 
05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
the middle of the pandemic
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
so any points made so we haven't had to
 
05:35:15.430 --> 05:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
use it are really
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh not accurate because we haven't had a
 
05:35:19.510 --> 05:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
chance to use it um
 
05:35:22.230 --> 05:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
i've we've heard from the state head of
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
ems we've heard from the
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
from private
 
05:35:27.120 --> 05:35:28.310 align:start position:0%
from private
companies

05:35:28.310 --> 05:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
companies
 
05:35:30.868 --> 05:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the compact itself
 
05:35:34.310 --> 05:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
all in favor no one against except for
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
one organization
 
05:35:37.910 --> 05:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i have total respect for that
 
05:35:37.920 --> 05:35:39.590 align:start position:0%
and i have total respect for that
organization

05:35:39.590 --> 05:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:35:41.350 --> 05:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters as i used to be in law
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement i like a brother from
 
05:35:45.270 --> 05:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
another mother to me and i stand with
 
05:35:45.280 --> 05:35:46.150 align:start position:0%
another mother to me and i stand with
them

05:35:46.150 --> 05:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:35:48.628 --> 05:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
however i just can't support
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
withdrawingness at this at this time
 
05:35:53.590 --> 05:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
based on hypotheticals if i could see
 
05:35:56.150 --> 05:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
some real harm that would be done
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
then i would definitely support getting
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
out of it but at this point
 
05:36:02.708 --> 05:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
um we have to at least let it all the
 
05:36:04.390 --> 05:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
work that was done we have to at least
 
05:36:05.350 --> 05:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
let it
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
try to work
 
05:36:09.190 --> 05:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
before we go ahead and pull it out with
 
05:36:10.868 --> 05:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely no reason
 
05:36:14.830 --> 05:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
represent pearson
 
05:36:20.320 --> 05:36:21.590 align:start position:0%
represent pearson
sure

05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:36:22.868 --> 05:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
a couple things
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
05:36:26.390 --> 05:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
05:36:30.150 --> 05:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
that we were we were blessed with was a
 
05:36:32.070 --> 05:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of confusion in the
 
05:36:34.230 --> 05:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
public hearing because there were
 
05:36:35.590 --> 05:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
things that were said and things that
 
05:36:37.030 --> 05:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
were brought forward that don't actually
 
05:36:40.390 --> 05:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
apply so a couple things to to clarify
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
this is a compact that is that only has
 
05:36:50.390 --> 05:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
a use under an emergency scenario this
 
05:36:54.150 --> 05:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
is not a daily procedural compact okay
 
05:36:54.160 --> 05:36:55.990 align:start position:0%
is not a daily procedural compact okay
so

05:36:55.990 --> 05:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
some of the things that were brought up
 
05:36:59.670 --> 05:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
that were interesting the whole
 
05:37:02.230 --> 05:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
dod angle with the spouses of military
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
folks if you come into the state of new
 
05:37:06.070 --> 05:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire as a someone who has your
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
national registry and you apply to the
 
05:37:09.030 --> 05:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
bureau of ems you're going to have your
 
05:37:11.510 --> 05:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
license in a week or less
 
05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
so it's not a barrier for that at all
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that because it is an
 
05:37:19.510 --> 05:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
emergency scenario use only a couple of
 
05:37:20.788 --> 05:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
interesting things come into effect
 
05:37:22.470 --> 05:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
first of all the closest compact state
 
05:37:24.948 --> 05:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
is delaware that's useless
 
05:37:26.548 --> 05:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
completely useless nobody from
 
05:37:29.430 --> 05:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
delaware's coming up here in a during a
 
05:37:31.030 --> 05:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
during a state of emergency that would
 
05:37:32.230 --> 05:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
follow under those conditions they're
 
05:37:33.750 --> 05:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
just too far away
 
05:37:36.070 --> 05:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
secondly is that the
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know we we've made we've made a lot
 
05:37:40.470 --> 05:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
of um
 
05:37:41.830 --> 05:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
we've made a lot of statements over the
 
05:37:43.990 --> 05:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
years and we've had a lot of concern and
 
05:37:45.430 --> 05:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
we've even done it here today about
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
talking about creating a a solution for
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
a problem that doesn't exist
 
05:37:51.990 --> 05:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:37:55.270 --> 05:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
the idea of what you would call a
 
05:37:58.708 --> 05:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
compact in emergency services has
 
05:38:00.548 --> 05:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
another term it's just called mutual aid
 
05:38:02.868 --> 05:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
it's existed forever as a matter of fact
 
05:38:05.270 --> 05:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
i gave a lecture once at the museum in
 
05:38:06.868 --> 05:38:06.878 align:start position:0%
manchester on
 
05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
um the longest mutual aid run the city
 
05:38:10.868 --> 05:38:10.878 align:start position:0%
of manchester ever did and that was to
 
05:38:12.628 --> 05:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
boston by train
 
05:38:12.638 --> 05:38:13.750 align:start position:0%
boston by train
so

05:38:13.750 --> 05:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:16.548 --> 05:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
you know we've we've had
 
05:38:18.548 --> 05:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
the emergency services professions have
 
05:38:21.510 --> 05:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
been dealing with this for 125 years or
 
05:38:21.520 --> 05:38:22.470 align:start position:0%
been dealing with this for 125 years or
more

05:38:22.470 --> 05:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:38:26.150 --> 05:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:29.430 --> 05:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
if you in a practical example hannover
 
05:38:29.440 --> 05:38:31.110 align:start position:0%
if you in a practical example hannover
salem

05:38:31.110 --> 05:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
salem
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
back even dover
 
05:38:34.548 --> 05:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
right they interact with agencies from
 
05:38:36.628 --> 05:38:36.638 align:start position:0%
other states all the time right you get
 
05:38:37.990 --> 05:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
a major fire in dover you're getting
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
help from maine it's happening you have
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of a you have a plane crash
 
05:38:43.590 --> 05:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
you have some sort of a significant
 
05:38:43.600 --> 05:38:44.548 align:start position:0%
you have some sort of a significant
event

05:38:44.548 --> 05:38:44.558 align:start position:0%
event
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
in salem hanover whatever we we already
 
05:38:49.270 --> 05:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
have these things worked out
 
05:38:49.280 --> 05:38:51.110 align:start position:0%
have these things worked out
so

05:38:51.110 --> 05:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:53.190 --> 05:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing it for a long time
 
05:38:55.270 --> 05:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
where this
 
05:38:57.270 --> 05:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
compact now becomes a
 
05:38:57.280 --> 05:38:58.708 align:start position:0%
compact now becomes a
problem

05:38:58.708 --> 05:38:58.718 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:39:00.390 --> 05:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:39:02.390 --> 05:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
first of all in order to enact it we'd
 
05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
have to have some sort of major crisis
 
05:39:04.638 --> 05:39:05.430 align:start position:0%
have to have some sort of major crisis
occur

05:39:05.430 --> 05:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
occur
 
05:39:07.350 --> 05:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
that would realistically be handled
 
05:39:09.270 --> 05:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
before the compact could even come into
 
05:39:11.510 --> 05:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
to to function because we're not going
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
to sit here and go sorry mass or you
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
know we're going to wait on the compact
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
to get help from delaware before or
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania or whatever before we
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
enact what we've been doing for the last
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
hundred years
 
05:39:24.628 --> 05:39:24.638 align:start position:0%
the the second problem with that is that
 
05:39:26.548 --> 05:39:26.558 align:start position:0%
again and i and i brought this up in a
 
05:39:29.350 --> 05:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
prior part we are now surrendering
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
control of what we decide to a compact a
 
05:39:34.548 --> 05:39:34.558 align:start position:0%
compact that involves states most of
 
05:39:36.788 --> 05:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
which are far west of here well
 
05:39:38.788 --> 05:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
everybody's far west of here but i'm
 
05:39:38.798 --> 05:39:39.750 align:start position:0%
everybody's far west of here but i'm
talking

05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
talking
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
you look at who's in the compact right
 
05:39:44.470 --> 05:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
now it's delaware and it's way out west
 
05:39:46.868 --> 05:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
so we we would now
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
and i still can't get an answer because
 
05:39:51.190 --> 05:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
honestly nobody nobody knows what's
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
going to happen because we've never
 
05:39:55.030 --> 05:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
enacted the compact what happens if the
 
05:39:58.150 --> 05:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
compact is enacted
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
to the all of the mutual aid agreements
 
05:40:02.788 --> 05:40:02.798 align:start position:0%
that we've had for 50 80 years
 
05:40:05.430 --> 05:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
what does that do do those conflict can
 
05:40:07.750 --> 05:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
they blend do we ignore one over the
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
other and nobody really knows because
 
05:40:11.670 --> 05:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
we've never had to do it
 
05:40:11.680 --> 05:40:12.868 align:start position:0%
we've never had to do it
so

05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:40:14.868 --> 05:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
that's a huge concern for me
 
05:40:17.590 --> 05:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
in in a profession that has figured this
 
05:40:17.600 --> 05:40:18.390 align:start position:0%
in in a profession that has figured this
out

05:40:18.390 --> 05:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:40:20.548 --> 05:40:20.558 align:start position:0%
50 to 80 years ago
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
the other problem here and i i guess
 
05:40:25.110 --> 05:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
this is an educational moment is the way
 
05:40:26.788 --> 05:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
that we function
 
05:40:29.670 --> 05:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
in ems is is a little bit different so
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
when you take your national registry
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
certification that's that's just a
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
certificate that just says hey you know
 
05:40:36.230 --> 05:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
what you meant the basic competency
 
05:40:38.310 --> 05:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
levels of being an emt but when you get
 
05:40:40.548 --> 05:40:40.558 align:start position:0%
into practice you now fall under the
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
protocols of the state of new hampshire
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
which is established by the bureau of
 
05:40:44.400 --> 05:40:45.430 align:start position:0%
which is established by the bureau of
ems

05:40:45.430 --> 05:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
ems
 
05:40:47.670 --> 05:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
but you also fall under a local local
 
05:40:49.590 --> 05:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
control so if you work in manchester
 
05:40:50.708 --> 05:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
your local
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
control is the elliott hospital if
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
you're in hanover it's dartmouth if
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
you're in salem it's split between
 
05:40:57.750 --> 05:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
parkland and holy family depending on
 
05:40:59.750 --> 05:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
where the patient wants to go
 
05:40:59.760 --> 05:41:00.708 align:start position:0%
where the patient wants to go
so

05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:02.788 --> 05:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
what happens is if you bring in folks
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
from out of state keep in mind under the
 
05:41:06.628 --> 05:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
compact they operate under their home
 
05:41:06.638 --> 05:41:07.830 align:start position:0%
compact they operate under their home
license

05:41:07.830 --> 05:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:41:09.510 --> 05:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
not new hampshires not new hampshire's
 
05:41:12.390 --> 05:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
protocols they operate under their home
 
05:41:14.070 --> 05:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
and those can be extraordinarily
 
05:41:15.510 --> 05:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
different in a lot of ways they can
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
either be more inclusive or less
 
05:41:17.040 --> 05:41:18.070 align:start position:0%
either be more inclusive or less
inclusive

05:41:18.070 --> 05:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
05:41:18.080 --> 05:41:20.470 align:start position:0%
inclusive
so

05:41:20.470 --> 05:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
05:41:23.190 --> 05:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
someone i wouldn't expect anybody from
 
05:41:25.270 --> 05:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
delaware or far out west to understand
 
05:41:27.190 --> 05:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
what new hampshire's protocols are
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
but the folks that work in methuen and
 
05:41:31.350 --> 05:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
the folks that work in
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
white river junction
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know and the folks in kittery have a
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
general idea because that's their
 
05:41:38.708 --> 05:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
regional network
 
05:41:39.910 --> 05:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
and they know what flies and what
 
05:41:42.310 --> 05:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't so
 
05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
this really
 
05:41:45.910 --> 05:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a complete change from that
 
05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
operational method that we function
 
05:41:49.190 --> 05:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
under right now
 
05:41:49.200 --> 05:41:50.390 align:start position:0%
under right now
and

05:41:50.390 --> 05:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate what representative roy
 
05:41:54.868 --> 05:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
said about you know the fact that
 
05:41:56.310 --> 05:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have vetted outcomes because
 
05:41:58.548 --> 05:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
we've never had to use it
 
05:41:59.990 --> 05:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the case of the compact that's
 
05:42:02.150 --> 05:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely true we don't know that we
 
05:42:04.470 --> 05:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
don't know it the other way as well
 
05:42:06.708 --> 05:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
what we do know is the past
 
05:42:09.190 --> 05:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
80 80 plus years of these mutual aid
 
05:42:11.830 --> 05:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
compacts are used all the time we know
 
05:42:13.830 --> 05:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
how they function we know how they work
 
05:42:15.510 --> 05:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
and they've been tweaked and
 
05:42:18.310 --> 05:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
wiggled for that time period so that's
 
05:42:21.110 --> 05:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
my big concern is
 
05:42:24.868 --> 05:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:27.350 --> 05:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
to rely solely on this compact that has
 
05:42:29.350 --> 05:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
never been enacted that is completely
 
05:42:31.350 --> 05:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
non-functional for us in new england
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:42:36.150 --> 05:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
and that lends its to the point where i
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
think it's you know we've talked about
 
05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
saying well if we have a if we get into
 
05:42:41.110 --> 05:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
a compact and we don't like it we can
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
always we can get back out i think this
 
05:42:45.270 --> 05:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
is a case where we jumped in too early
 
05:42:46.868 --> 05:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
and let's
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
see how this let's let's let this
 
05:42:52.070 --> 05:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
compact actually get to somewhere in our
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
part of the country before we we start
 
05:42:56.708 --> 05:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
to rely on this and that's that's the
 
05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
point of of
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the idea to remove this this is why
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
the governor supports removing it it's
 
05:43:05.590 --> 05:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:08.310 --> 05:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's just not functioning whatsoever so
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's my deal that's why i
 
05:43:13.350 --> 05:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
support the removal of of this compact
 
05:43:13.360 --> 05:43:14.948 align:start position:0%
support the removal of of this compact
and

05:43:14.948 --> 05:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:43:17.670 --> 05:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
i certainly welcome questions or or
 
05:43:19.270 --> 05:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
additional comments
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:25.590 --> 05:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i'll follow up
 
05:43:28.230 --> 05:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
on representative pearson's um
 
05:43:31.270 --> 05:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
regards to uh the protocols
 
05:43:31.280 --> 05:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
regards to uh the protocols
um

05:43:32.230 --> 05:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:34.948 --> 05:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
as a emt and a firefighter we
 
05:43:37.590 --> 05:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
had to take the
 
05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
rollout protocol exams through the state
 
05:43:40.868 --> 05:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire an online course
 
05:43:44.868 --> 05:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
showing competency and state protocol
 
05:43:48.070 --> 05:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
during the subcommittee i had asked
 
05:43:49.750 --> 05:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
about protocols and what would be
 
05:43:52.390 --> 05:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
followed going forward
 
05:43:54.628 --> 05:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
and this is the issue i have with these
 
05:43:57.190 --> 05:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
compacts because being so early on i
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
05:44:00.310 --> 05:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
they understand or
 
05:44:03.030 --> 05:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
they don't know what's truly going on
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
in these compacts i had asked about
 
05:44:07.110 --> 05:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
protocols which protocol would be
 
05:44:07.120 --> 05:44:09.030 align:start position:0%
protocols which protocol would be
followed

05:44:09.030 --> 05:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
followed
 
05:44:10.708 --> 05:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
if someone from out of state came to new
 
05:44:13.510 --> 05:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire and how it would go through
 
05:44:14.788 --> 05:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
from there
 
05:44:17.030 --> 05:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
first answer i got was
 
05:44:18.390 --> 05:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
they would follow their home state
 
05:44:18.400 --> 05:44:19.750 align:start position:0%
they would follow their home state
protocol

05:44:19.750 --> 05:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
05:44:19.760 --> 05:44:20.708 align:start position:0%
protocol
unless

05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
unless
 
05:44:22.470 --> 05:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire decides later on that they
 
05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
want them to
 
05:44:25.030 --> 05:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
transfer over into the new hampshire
 
05:44:25.040 --> 05:44:26.470 align:start position:0%
transfer over into the new hampshire
protocol

05:44:26.470 --> 05:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
05:44:28.070 --> 05:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then i was told by new hampshire
 
05:44:29.270 --> 05:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
that no
 
05:44:31.270 --> 05:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
they would have to do the state protocol
 
05:44:31.280 --> 05:44:32.708 align:start position:0%
they would have to do the state protocol
exam

05:44:32.708 --> 05:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
exam
 
05:44:35.430 --> 05:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
provide care here in the state so nobody
 
05:44:43.110 --> 05:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
seemed to know what the answer was in
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
this compact as to following protocols
 
05:44:46.948 --> 05:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
and that's key when you're talking about
 
05:44:48.868 --> 05:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
ems and you're talking about
 
05:44:48.878 --> 05:44:50.548 align:start position:0%
ems and you're talking about
care

05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:44:52.628 --> 05:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
in a state
 
05:44:55.510 --> 05:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
so this for that reason i mean i i i
 
05:44:57.030 --> 05:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't think i think we have mutual aid
 
05:44:59.430 --> 05:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
agreements this has worked well for for
 
05:45:02.070 --> 05:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
years here in new hampshire and we have
 
05:45:03.750 --> 05:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding states that are willing to
 
05:45:06.070 --> 05:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
help out um if we need more than that
 
05:45:08.708 --> 05:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
from either further out of state um in a
 
05:45:11.110 --> 05:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
time of a dire emergency we see that the
 
05:45:12.868 --> 05:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
executive orders work with temporary
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
licensure and
 
05:45:16.548 --> 05:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
reducing the restrictions as people come
 
05:45:18.548 --> 05:45:18.558 align:start position:0%
up and are needed to help here in new
 
05:45:20.830 --> 05:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i think i think this is
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
premature um
 
05:45:24.390 --> 05:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that those that are
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
involved actually know how their compact
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
is working when i
 
05:45:30.548 --> 05:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
got this answered and um for that reason
 
05:45:33.910 --> 05:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
i can i'll i'll support the repeal
 
05:45:36.948 --> 05:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
right remember
 
05:45:38.788 --> 05:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair um a couple of things one
 
05:45:44.708 --> 05:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
is um on the issue of their the closest
 
05:45:46.310 --> 05:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
one is delaware
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
and that uh we should wait until
 
05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's closer i think there's a
 
05:45:51.270 --> 05:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
certain amount of chicken and egg
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
problem there
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
i mean if that was the main argument
 
05:45:55.430 --> 05:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
against it i would
 
05:45:57.910 --> 05:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
discount it because um
 
05:45:59.350 --> 05:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know other states here might not
 
05:46:00.788 --> 05:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
want to join it if there's nobody else
 
05:46:03.190 --> 05:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
around and if we are out of it
 
05:46:04.788 --> 05:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's kind of a thing where
 
05:46:06.948 --> 05:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some first movers and
 
05:46:06.958 --> 05:46:07.910 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some first movers and
uh

05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:46:09.270 --> 05:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
and then you see what happens maybe
 
05:46:09.280 --> 05:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
and then you see what happens maybe
nobody

05:46:10.470 --> 05:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
05:46:12.070 --> 05:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
close to us will ever join it in which
 
05:46:13.750 --> 05:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
case the thing will
 
05:46:15.670 --> 05:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
basically have no effect but there's no
 
05:46:17.190 --> 05:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity or less of an opportunity
 
05:46:20.230 --> 05:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
anyway for closer states to join if we
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
choose to get out of it
 
05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh the other one is i may have missed
 
05:46:24.868 --> 05:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
something but
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
my take during the subcommittee meeting
 
05:46:28.230 --> 05:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
was that um
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
somebody coming here would have to
 
05:46:31.590 --> 05:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
follow the new hampshire protocols and
 
05:46:33.270 --> 05:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's similar to the other
 
05:46:34.788 --> 05:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
compacts we have like the ones we just
 
05:46:36.070 --> 05:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy and speech
 
05:46:41.110 --> 05:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
pathologists and audiologists
 
05:46:42.230 --> 05:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know those
 
05:46:43.270 --> 05:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
if they're going to practice in new
 
05:46:45.110 --> 05:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire do you have they're under the
 
05:46:46.868 --> 05:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rules
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's true of the other
 
05:46:51.510 --> 05:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
compacts although maybe i missed
 
05:46:53.910 --> 05:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
something in the subcommittee hearing
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have at the moment
 
05:46:57.270 --> 05:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:47:00.070 --> 05:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you a couple points
 
05:47:03.990 --> 05:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the department of
 
05:47:06.548 --> 05:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
defense um they sure are spending an
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
awful lot of time on something that um
 
05:47:11.670 --> 05:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
the opinion is that they don't need to
 
05:47:13.830 --> 05:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
be involved in they do in fact need to
 
05:47:15.510 --> 05:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
be involved it does not have to be an
 
05:47:17.270 --> 05:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
emergency order to activate the compact
 
05:47:19.910 --> 05:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
the compact is always active
 
05:47:22.628 --> 05:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
it just with regard to normal employees
 
05:47:24.390 --> 05:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
they can't take regularly scheduled
 
05:47:26.070 --> 05:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
shifts with the exception of the
 
05:47:26.080 --> 05:47:27.750 align:start position:0%
shifts with the exception of the
military

05:47:27.750 --> 05:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
military
 
05:47:29.190 --> 05:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is an important issue to the
 
05:47:31.590 --> 05:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
military for a couple of reasons
 
05:47:34.548 --> 05:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
one for our own citizens new hampshire
 
05:47:36.868 --> 05:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
spouses of military members assigned
 
05:47:38.948 --> 05:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
across the country that are involved in
 
05:47:40.788 --> 05:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
the compact states can get their
 
05:47:42.150 --> 05:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
licensure using the new hampshire
 
05:47:44.788 --> 05:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
certification and vice versa
 
05:47:46.708 --> 05:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
the military clearly told us when they
 
05:47:48.708 --> 05:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
do base grading
 
05:47:50.310 --> 05:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
which they do every year they issue a
 
05:47:52.470 --> 05:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
report card on bases and one of the main
 
05:47:54.470 --> 05:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
criteria is how friendly it is to
 
05:47:56.548 --> 05:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
spouses and family members of military
 
05:47:56.558 --> 05:47:58.470 align:start position:0%
spouses and family members of military
deployed

05:47:58.470 --> 05:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
deployed
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that comes into decisions with
 
05:48:02.548 --> 05:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
regard to base closing or expanding
 
05:48:05.830 --> 05:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
bases particularly the f-35 joint strike
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
fighter whether it goes to portsmouth or
 
05:48:10.470 --> 05:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
it goes to burlington that's a huge
 
05:48:12.788 --> 05:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
influx of money to our state
 
05:48:15.270 --> 05:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
that could go to vermont simply because
 
05:48:16.868 --> 05:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
you know we we don't rate quite as
 
05:48:19.030 --> 05:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
highly because we make this decision or
 
05:48:21.430 --> 05:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
if they come down to closing bases
 
05:48:22.708 --> 05:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
all things being equal they're going to
 
05:48:23.750 --> 05:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
look at the states that are more
 
05:48:26.390 --> 05:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
friendly to the families of spouses of
 
05:48:27.990 --> 05:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
military members
 
05:48:30.628 --> 05:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
so it is a reality for the military
 
05:48:32.470 --> 05:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
um second of all with regard to how
 
05:48:35.430 --> 05:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
close the states are we heard testimony
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
that um colorado used this uh during the
 
05:48:41.430 --> 05:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
wildfires they had emts out there under
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
the license compact assisting
 
05:48:44.240 --> 05:48:45.190 align:start position:0%
the license compact assisting
um

05:48:45.190 --> 05:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:45.200 --> 05:48:46.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:48:46.230 --> 05:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think geography is necessarily a
 
05:48:51.190 --> 05:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
bar and the more states that join the
 
05:48:53.110 --> 05:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
more it's going to be
 
05:48:55.590 --> 05:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
used hopefully if necessary we heard
 
05:48:57.270 --> 05:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's several states
 
05:48:59.270 --> 05:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
this year who are considering this
 
05:49:00.948 --> 05:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
we are not considering this we already
 
05:49:02.708 --> 05:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
considered it and passed it into law and
 
05:49:04.628 --> 05:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
the governor signed it and i have not
 
05:49:05.990 --> 05:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
heard that the governor supported
 
05:49:07.510 --> 05:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
repealing it as a matter of fact i heard
 
05:49:09.910 --> 05:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
to the contrary um
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
mostly uh because of the fact that it
 
05:49:15.270 --> 05:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
it um fits into his general scheme of
 
05:49:16.868 --> 05:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
things with this covert emergency and
 
05:49:18.788 --> 05:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
for the military reasons
 
05:49:20.708 --> 05:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
so this is this is definitely important
 
05:49:22.150 --> 05:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
everything i've heard against it
 
05:49:24.070 --> 05:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
everything i've heard to pull out of it
 
05:49:26.310 --> 05:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
are things that might possibly could
 
05:49:28.708 --> 05:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
maybe at some point cause a problem but
 
05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
nothing definitely concrete
 
05:49:33.510 --> 05:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony clear testimony
 
05:49:35.190 --> 05:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
that they had to practice under the new
 
05:49:35.200 --> 05:49:36.548 align:start position:0%
that they had to practice under the new
hampshire

05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:49:38.708 --> 05:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
license rules because
 
05:49:40.470 --> 05:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
someone can't just show up here and hang
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
out a shingle and say i'm an emt they
 
05:49:44.628 --> 05:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
have to practice underneath someone as
 
05:49:46.470 --> 05:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative pearson said underneath
 
05:49:48.868 --> 05:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
the hospital or an ambulance company
 
05:49:50.628 --> 05:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
and for them to be able to practice they
 
05:49:52.628 --> 05:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
have to meet the new hampshire standards
 
05:49:54.390 --> 05:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
so someone can't come here with a kansas
 
05:49:56.070 --> 05:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
emt license
 
05:49:58.310 --> 05:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
and just start practicing the kansas way
 
05:50:00.470 --> 05:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
which may be better or worse they have
 
05:50:02.150 --> 05:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
to meet the new hampshire stat standards
 
05:50:03.910 --> 05:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
of practice because they're practicing
 
05:50:06.788 --> 05:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
underneath someone so all the arguments
 
05:50:09.590 --> 05:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
still to this very minute to pull us out
 
05:50:11.590 --> 05:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
of this compact are all
 
05:50:13.830 --> 05:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
well it could possibly be bad well it
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
could possibly be very good and pulling
 
05:50:18.470 --> 05:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
out of it could possibly be bad so i
 
05:50:20.788 --> 05:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
would ask everyone to really think about
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
why would we get out of something we put
 
05:50:24.150 --> 05:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of work and study into getting
 
05:50:24.160 --> 05:50:25.030 align:start position:0%
a lot of work and study into getting
into

05:50:25.030 --> 05:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:50:26.788 --> 05:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
simply because
 
05:50:29.750 --> 05:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
it might not be so good we're not sure
 
05:50:32.390 --> 05:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
but we know it's got positive upsides so
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
i would ask everyone to really think
 
05:50:35.190 --> 05:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
about this
 
05:50:37.110 --> 05:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
wanting to pull out of it just because i
 
05:50:38.868 --> 05:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
mean the same people
 
05:50:38.878 --> 05:50:39.750 align:start position:0%
mean the same people
um

05:50:39.750 --> 05:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:41.430 --> 05:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
could have made these arguments several
 
05:50:43.110 --> 05:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
years ago i know one of them did but
 
05:50:44.548 --> 05:50:44.558 align:start position:0%
others didn't
 
05:50:46.470 --> 05:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
to not get into this in the first place
 
05:50:48.548 --> 05:50:48.558 align:start position:0%
and those arguments were vetted
 
05:50:48.558 --> 05:50:49.430 align:start position:0%
and those arguments were vetted
and

05:50:49.430 --> 05:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
so i would i would ask everyone to vote
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.830 --> 05:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:50:59.510 --> 05:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
respond to some of the things new
 
05:51:01.270 --> 05:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire did make the first move in the
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
region and no one followed
 
05:51:03.200 --> 05:51:04.948 align:start position:0%
region and no one followed
so

05:51:04.948 --> 05:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
this this has existed for several
 
05:51:09.190 --> 05:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
several years in under when it was
 
05:51:11.750 --> 05:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
passed and it would the enaction date
 
05:51:13.990 --> 05:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
that that has come by
 
05:51:14.000 --> 05:51:15.110 align:start position:0%
that that has come by
um

05:51:15.110 --> 05:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:16.948 --> 05:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
a year and a half ago but nobody else
 
05:51:19.350 --> 05:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
followed so we did make the first move
 
05:51:21.270 --> 05:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
we did throw the dangle the carrot out
 
05:51:23.350 --> 05:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
and no one took a bite the other thing
 
05:51:24.708 --> 05:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
05:51:24.718 --> 05:51:25.830 align:start position:0%
as far as
um

05:51:25.830 --> 05:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:28.070 --> 05:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
this protocol you've got to look at the
 
05:51:30.230 --> 05:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
protocol the protocol for new hampshire
 
05:51:32.788 --> 05:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
says it has to be emergency use only if
 
05:51:34.548 --> 05:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
you come here from kansas
 
05:51:36.548 --> 05:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
and you want to practice as an emt you
 
05:51:38.310 --> 05:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
have to get a new hampshire license you
 
05:51:40.788 --> 05:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
can't use the compact to do that and
 
05:51:42.628 --> 05:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
that's an important part this compact is
 
05:51:45.190 --> 05:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
very different from what with the
 
05:51:46.948 --> 05:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
ideologists that we just use as an
 
05:51:46.958 --> 05:51:48.070 align:start position:0%
ideologists that we just use as an
example

05:51:48.070 --> 05:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:51:50.390 --> 05:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
that this is not a standard way of doing
 
05:51:53.910 --> 05:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
business this is emergency use only
 
05:51:55.830 --> 05:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
vermont as a comparison you know you
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
talk about the f-35 vermont's not in the
 
05:51:59.670 --> 05:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
compact so
 
05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
i mean if we're if we're looking at it
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
making the state of new hampshire more
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
enticing that then then we're worried
 
05:52:06.868 --> 05:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
about being competitive with those
 
05:52:09.350 --> 05:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
around us again nobody around us does
 
05:52:11.110 --> 05:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
this so
 
05:52:12.548 --> 05:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's a factor in that
 
05:52:14.708 --> 05:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
regard and and i will reiterate again
 
05:52:16.548 --> 05:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
the bureau of ems told me
 
05:52:18.548 --> 05:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
that if you're a military spouse and you
 
05:52:20.230 --> 05:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
come here as a nationally registered emt
 
05:52:22.310 --> 05:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to get
 
05:52:24.070 --> 05:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
in less than one week
 
05:52:26.310 --> 05:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
so there's no there's there's no barrier
 
05:52:28.230 --> 05:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
for military spouses to come in here in
 
05:52:29.910 --> 05:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
practice at all
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
if they're getting their license in less
 
05:52:32.470 --> 05:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
than a week
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
that it's a matter of taking getting
 
05:52:35.670 --> 05:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
hired and taking a protocol exam you're
 
05:52:35.680 --> 05:52:36.390 align:start position:0%
hired and taking a protocol exam you're
done

05:52:36.390 --> 05:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:52:36.400 --> 05:52:37.510 align:start position:0%
done
so

05:52:37.510 --> 05:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
again this is this is just
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
it was something that was a bill of
 
05:52:43.510 --> 05:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
goods that was sold and it's just not
 
05:52:45.030 --> 05:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
panned out
 
05:52:46.628 --> 05:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
and i and like i said the fear that i
 
05:52:48.390 --> 05:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
have is that this is
 
05:52:50.868 --> 05:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
this has really never been fully vetted
 
05:52:52.070 --> 05:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
as to what's going to happen with the
 
05:52:53.350 --> 05:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
mutual aid agreements with the
 
05:52:53.360 --> 05:52:54.390 align:start position:0%
mutual aid agreements with the
surrounding

05:52:54.390 --> 05:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
surrounding
 
05:52:57.030 --> 05:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
communities the surrounding states
 
05:52:57.040 --> 05:52:59.270 align:start position:0%
communities the surrounding states
representative

05:52:59.270 --> 05:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i did find the
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
department of defense liaison's
 
05:53:07.590 --> 05:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
testimony to be compelling
 
05:53:10.390 --> 05:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
and he actually convinced me that what
 
05:53:12.548 --> 05:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
we likely need to do
 
05:53:14.948 --> 05:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
on that issue and i i'm also hearing
 
05:53:17.350 --> 05:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
what representative pearson is saying i
 
05:53:19.270 --> 05:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
think we need a separate piece of
 
05:53:19.280 --> 05:53:20.788 align:start position:0%
think we need a separate piece of
legislation

05:53:20.788 --> 05:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:53:24.788 --> 05:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
to look at licensing overall and see
 
05:53:24.798 --> 05:53:25.590 align:start position:0%
to look at licensing overall and see
and

05:53:25.590 --> 05:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps study but
 
05:53:30.788 --> 05:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
do an assessment
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
formally or informally just make sure
 
05:53:34.868 --> 05:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
that those
 
05:53:37.430 --> 05:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
licensing procedures etc
 
05:53:40.788 --> 05:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
are welcoming of military families i
 
05:53:43.350 --> 05:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
know we don't have as many as we used to
 
05:53:46.230 --> 05:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
but i do find it very relevant and that
 
05:53:49.590 --> 05:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually convinced me to uh support this
 
05:53:49.600 --> 05:53:50.708 align:start position:0%
actually convinced me to uh support this
provision

05:53:50.708 --> 05:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
provision
 
05:53:53.110 --> 05:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill so
 
05:53:53.120 --> 05:53:54.230 align:start position:0%
of this bill so
um

05:53:54.230 --> 05:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know hearing the concerns that
 
05:53:58.070 --> 05:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative roy is stating i i do
 
05:54:00.628 --> 05:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
agree that that is a concern and i think
 
05:54:02.310 --> 05:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
we need to actually make that piece
 
05:54:02.320 --> 05:54:03.190 align:start position:0%
we need to actually make that piece
bigger

05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
bigger
 
05:54:05.910 --> 05:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that that is necessary
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
um for this for this piece and i do
 
05:54:10.150 --> 05:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
support the
 
05:54:11.910 --> 05:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
um repeat
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
repeal i guess you'd say um support this
 
05:54:18.868 --> 05:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:25.110 --> 05:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and well i
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
just want to respond to the comments
 
05:54:29.110 --> 05:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
that the individuals will have to
 
05:54:31.430 --> 05:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
practice on the new hampshire protocol i
 
05:54:33.190 --> 05:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
i understand that was what we got from
 
05:54:33.200 --> 05:54:33.910 align:start position:0%
i understand that was what we got from
the

05:54:33.910 --> 05:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
bureau of ems but the initial response
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe it was someone from the
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
interstate compact themselves who said
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
that the person would be practicing
 
05:54:44.070 --> 05:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
under their home state and that's the
 
05:54:45.990 --> 05:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
point i wanted to make that
 
05:54:47.430 --> 05:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
the left doesn't know what the right is
 
05:54:49.270 --> 05:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
doing but it doesn't appear that way
 
05:54:51.350 --> 05:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
from those comments it's the only reason
 
05:54:52.868 --> 05:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
i made that statement
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
and second of all um going back to
 
05:54:58.868 --> 05:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
military personnel
 
05:55:00.788 --> 05:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
under this compact
 
05:55:02.708 --> 05:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
there are three lines dealing with the
 
05:55:04.708 --> 05:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
military personnel
 
05:55:07.750 --> 05:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
or three sections an a b and c um and i
 
05:55:09.990 --> 05:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
see no reason why we have to be a
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
compact state to implement what these a
 
05:55:16.230 --> 05:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
b and c state now be brief
 
05:55:18.150 --> 05:55:18.160 align:start position:0%

05:55:20.470 --> 05:55:20.480 align:start position:0%

05:55:44.230 --> 05:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
training and examining requirements
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
for such licensure b membership states
 
05:55:49.110 --> 05:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
shall expedite the processing of
 
05:55:51.190 --> 05:55:51.200 align:start position:0%

and see finally all individuals
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%

the adverse actions provisions of
 
05:56:09.910 --> 05:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:12.310 --> 05:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
now i read that madam chair and i look
 
05:56:14.310 --> 05:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
at it and i say why do we have to have a
 
05:56:17.030 --> 05:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
compact state to do those things
 
05:56:18.868 --> 05:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
we could put that in our own statutes
 
05:56:20.390 --> 05:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
without having to be in the compact
 
05:56:22.230 --> 05:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
state i don't know if anybody actually
 
05:56:24.070 --> 05:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
ever read any of this that's in here
 
05:56:26.390 --> 05:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
this current statute as to what it means
 
05:56:28.628 --> 05:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
with military personnel but we don't
 
05:56:31.270 --> 05:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
need to be in a compact to do those do
 
05:56:32.548 --> 05:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
those things
 
05:56:35.910 --> 05:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
um so i'd be happy to if
 
05:56:38.070 --> 05:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
we get out of this compact
 
05:56:40.310 --> 05:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
to uh sponsor the legislation to put
 
05:56:42.470 --> 05:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
this into our statutes the same language
 
05:56:44.070 --> 05:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
so that we are doing that
 
05:56:45.110 --> 05:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
05:56:46.948 --> 05:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
alleviate the dod's
 
05:56:49.350 --> 05:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
um problems with getting out of a
 
05:56:51.510 --> 05:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
compact thank you
 
05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:59.590 --> 05:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well uh
 
05:57:02.548 --> 05:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a very thorny issue
 
05:57:02.558 --> 05:57:03.350 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a very thorny issue
but

05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:57:04.548 --> 05:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
05:57:07.190 --> 05:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
want to throw in a couple of examples
 
05:57:07.200 --> 05:57:08.150 align:start position:0%
want to throw in a couple of examples
uh

05:57:08.150 --> 05:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:57:08.160 --> 05:57:09.110 align:start position:0%
uh
that

05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:57:11.590 --> 05:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
have not been addressed yet uh one of
 
05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
our former colleagues
 
05:57:16.548 --> 05:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
former representative mark prue who was
 
05:57:18.708 --> 05:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee
 
05:57:20.708 --> 05:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
together with me as a matter of fact
 
05:57:20.718 --> 05:57:21.750 align:start position:0%
together with me as a matter of fact
that

05:57:21.750 --> 05:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
originally processed the
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:57:28.070 --> 05:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
to set up the compact
 
05:57:30.628 --> 05:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
that we're now talking about repealing
 
05:57:30.638 --> 05:57:32.150 align:start position:0%
that we're now talking about repealing
um

05:57:32.150 --> 05:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:35.830 --> 05:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:38.310 --> 05:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
and he said that he was not in favor of
 
05:57:40.788 --> 05:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
getting back out again out of it
 
05:57:42.230 --> 05:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
but he also
 
05:57:44.548 --> 05:57:44.558 align:start position:0%
reminded me of a couple of things
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh that i was aware of but had not
 
05:57:50.310 --> 05:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
occurred to me and namely uh
 
05:57:53.110 --> 05:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is not a mutual aid
 
05:57:53.120 --> 05:57:54.390 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is not a mutual aid
situation

05:57:54.390 --> 05:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:57:57.030 --> 05:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh that representative pearson mentioned
 
05:58:00.150 --> 05:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:00.160 --> 05:58:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
where

05:58:01.030 --> 05:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:58:01.040 --> 05:58:01.910 align:start position:0%
where
where

05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:58:01.920 --> 05:58:03.270 align:start position:0%
where
firefighters

05:58:03.270 --> 05:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
05:58:05.590 --> 05:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
get called in to fight fires
 
05:58:08.788 --> 05:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
or other similar emergencies
 
05:58:10.548 --> 05:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
representative former representative
 
05:58:13.990 --> 05:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
prue uh was out in california
 
05:58:16.470 --> 05:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i recall that he also went down to
 
05:58:19.110 --> 05:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh puerto rico
 
05:58:20.628 --> 05:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
damn that phone
 
05:58:23.270 --> 05:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
went down to puerto rico
 
05:58:24.830 --> 05:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
and texas during
 
05:58:28.628 --> 05:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:29.910 --> 05:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
05:58:32.070 --> 05:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
the hurricanes in in
 
05:58:34.628 --> 05:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
the south and in puerto rico
 
05:58:36.390 --> 05:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
that was down there
 
05:58:38.070 --> 05:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
they had an emergency we didn't have
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
that emergency
 
05:58:41.750 --> 05:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
california had the fires
 
05:58:43.590 --> 05:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
they had that emergency we didn't have
 
05:58:45.670 --> 05:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
that emergency so it's not like that
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
like the pandemic
 
05:58:47.280 --> 05:58:48.868 align:start position:0%
like the pandemic
where

05:58:48.868 --> 05:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
it got the whole country
 
05:58:51.120 --> 05:58:52.390 align:start position:0%
it got the whole country
so

05:58:52.390 --> 05:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:58:54.150 --> 05:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's an example of the kind of
 
05:58:56.310 --> 05:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
situation where the distance also
 
05:58:59.430 --> 05:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference such as uh
 
05:59:01.350 --> 05:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that delaware is not right
 
05:59:03.830 --> 05:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
around the corner but california is not
 
05:59:05.910 --> 05:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
right around the corner puerto rico's
 
05:59:07.670 --> 05:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
not right around the corner texas is not
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
right around the corner yet uh
 
05:59:12.470 --> 05:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
mark prue was involved in all those
 
05:59:15.670 --> 05:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
things because they required emts not
 
05:59:15.680 --> 05:59:16.948 align:start position:0%
things because they required emts not
firefighters

05:59:16.948 --> 05:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
05:59:22.708 --> 05:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
so uh just for consideration so i'm uh
 
05:59:24.628 --> 05:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
i it seems to me that what
 
05:59:26.948 --> 05:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
representative roy said earlier that uh
 
05:59:29.670 --> 05:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
we barely just got this thing activated
 
05:59:31.990 --> 05:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh and getting out of it on
 
05:59:32.000 --> 05:59:33.510 align:start position:0%
uh and getting out of it on
hypotheticals

05:59:33.510 --> 05:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals
 
05:59:36.310 --> 05:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't seem wise to me so i'm going
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:46.788 --> 05:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:49.510 --> 05:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think this is a question for our two
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
firefighters um
 
05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
there are four well i guess we have
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:03.270 --> 06:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong i believe
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
that emts
 
06:00:05.600 --> 06:00:06.948 align:start position:0%
that emts
are

06:00:06.948 --> 06:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
are called emts licensed as emts by
 
06:00:15.090 --> 06:00:15.100 align:start position:0%
national standards is that not true
 
06:00:15.100 --> 06:00:18.230 align:start position:0%
national standards is that not true
[Music]

06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:00:19.830 --> 06:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
the national
 
06:00:22.548 --> 06:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
standards are the minimum requirements
 
06:00:24.548 --> 06:00:24.558 align:start position:0%
that's where they get the training
 
06:00:27.110 --> 06:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
and then they are likely staffed by the
 
06:00:27.120 --> 06:00:29.190 align:start position:0%
and then they are likely staffed by the
state

06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:00:33.990 --> 06:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:36.470 --> 06:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
but you do need a national
 
06:00:38.628 --> 06:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
license in order to
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
operate communication yes yes thank you
 
06:00:42.718 --> 06:00:43.750 align:start position:0%
operate communication yes yes thank you
yes

06:00:43.750 --> 06:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:00:43.760 --> 06:00:46.230 align:start position:0%
yes
and

06:00:46.230 --> 06:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:00:48.390 --> 06:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to mention that from the
 
06:00:48.400 --> 06:00:50.230 align:start position:0%
i'd like to mention that from the
testimony

06:00:50.230 --> 06:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:00:53.190 --> 06:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
it appeared that this compact
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
was not so much
 
06:00:56.948 --> 06:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
helpful for bringing
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
other safe people into new hampshire it
 
06:01:01.830 --> 06:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
was to help new hampshire people
 
06:01:04.470 --> 06:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
licensees working outside the state in
 
06:01:07.190 --> 06:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
an emergency we heard stories
 
06:01:09.750 --> 06:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
as representative schmidt said of
 
06:01:11.910 --> 06:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
people working in hurricanes or forest
 
06:01:15.030 --> 06:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
fires and because they were working in
 
06:01:17.350 --> 06:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
compact states
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
they had the ability to use their new
 
06:01:22.708 --> 06:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire credentials
 
06:01:25.510 --> 06:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
and that i think is important
 
06:01:28.470 --> 06:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
that we that when our people are called
 
06:01:30.868 --> 06:01:30.878 align:start position:0%
into other states they are able to work
 
06:01:34.150 --> 06:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
to the full extent of their license
 
06:01:38.150 --> 06:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative ryan and pearson
 
06:01:39.910 --> 06:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:01:41.270 --> 06:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to reiterate i mean i
 
06:01:42.470 --> 06:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
think everyone knows where i stand on
 
06:01:44.150 --> 06:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
this but i was wondering since we did it
 
06:01:46.788 --> 06:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
for the previous bills could we possibly
 
06:01:48.470 --> 06:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
um allow
 
06:01:50.708 --> 06:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
i believe the head of the state ems is
 
06:01:52.470 --> 06:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the participant list if we if we
 
06:01:54.628 --> 06:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
could get someone in just because we
 
06:01:57.190 --> 06:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
seem to be having difficulty uh
 
06:01:58.948 --> 06:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
reinterpreting testimony from the
 
06:01:58.958 --> 06:02:00.150 align:start position:0%
reinterpreting testimony from the
subcommittee

06:02:00.150 --> 06:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
06:02:01.990 --> 06:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
and if we could get some maybe direct
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
answers to a couple of these direct
 
06:02:05.350 --> 06:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
questions such as scope of practice and
 
06:02:07.190 --> 06:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
things like that it might be helpful for
 
06:02:08.868 --> 06:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
the whole committee to hear it straight
 
06:02:13.510 --> 06:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:14.948 --> 06:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
if there's anyone
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
at this meeting who can answer those
 
06:02:19.670 --> 06:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions please
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
06:02:23.270 --> 06:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
a couple things the
 
06:02:24.868 --> 06:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
under under katrina we'll use the
 
06:02:26.788 --> 06:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
hurricanes as an example they did not
 
06:02:26.798 --> 06:02:27.830 align:start position:0%
hurricanes as an example they did not
practice

06:02:27.830 --> 06:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
practice
 
06:02:29.430 --> 06:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
down there under the compact they
 
06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
practice with the national response plan
 
06:02:33.830 --> 06:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
and provisions of fema
 
06:02:35.750 --> 06:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
that so that let's not confuse the
 
06:02:39.510 --> 06:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
compact with with emergency procedures
 
06:02:40.788 --> 06:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
at the federal level because they are
 
06:02:42.470 --> 06:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
not the same
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
they are not even close to the same so
 
06:02:44.958 --> 06:02:46.948 align:start position:0%
they are not even close to the same so
so

06:02:46.948 --> 06:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
but the national response plan and the
 
06:02:51.510 --> 06:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
provisions in fema aren't going anywhere
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:08.390 --> 06:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen anyone here who would be
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
able to answer your questions
 
06:03:11.430 --> 06:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
06:03:13.590 --> 06:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to go by our memories and
 
06:03:24.390 --> 06:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:24.400 --> 06:03:25.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:03:25.590 --> 06:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:28.070 --> 06:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
06:03:30.310 --> 06:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
so my
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
and my inclination is to let the thing
 
06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
stay in place unless we
 
06:03:37.510 --> 06:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know unless there are actual
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
problems that are found and it appears
 
06:03:42.390 --> 06:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
there might be some benefits to it
 
06:03:44.390 --> 06:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that there are existing
 
06:03:46.230 --> 06:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
significant problems i mean if there are
 
06:03:48.548 --> 06:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
problems that show up in the future i'd
 
06:03:50.788 --> 06:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
you know certainly be open to uh getting
 
06:03:53.270 --> 06:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
rid of it at that time but uh you know
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
balancing whatever those other problems
 
06:03:55.830 --> 06:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
are versus
 
06:03:57.910 --> 06:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
any benefits and and maybe it will turn
 
06:04:00.230 --> 06:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
out that it's not worth having but
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know i you can you can maybe we've
 
06:04:04.390 --> 06:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
dangled a carrot but so given the speed
 
06:04:05.990 --> 06:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
of legislative processes and they have
 
06:04:07.430 --> 06:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
to dangle out there for quite a bit
 
06:04:09.430 --> 06:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
longer before anything happens in the
 
06:04:10.948 --> 06:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
end it may not but
 
06:04:10.958 --> 06:04:11.590 align:start position:0%
end it may not but
i

06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:04:13.590 --> 06:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is to in my plan is to
 
06:04:17.750 --> 06:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
just leave it out there for for now
 
06:04:20.868 --> 06:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
madam chairs uh mr real is i recall that
 
06:04:23.030 --> 06:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
name is being someone i see him in the
 
06:04:27.270 --> 06:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
participants list he's the president
 
06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
yes he's the president of the
 
06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters union he didn't answer the
 
06:04:31.360 --> 06:04:32.310 align:start position:0%
firefighters union he didn't answer the
request

06:04:32.310 --> 06:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
request
 
06:04:32.320 --> 06:04:33.190 align:start position:0%
request
he

06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
he
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
didn't answer the request to
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
06:04:38.160 --> 06:04:38.948 align:start position:0%
answer questions
okay

06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:04:40.868 --> 06:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
there was one other but okay if no one's
 
06:04:42.548 --> 06:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
raising their hand then we'll just have
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
to go with what we know
 
06:04:44.400 --> 06:04:45.990 align:start position:0%
to go with what we know
okay

06:04:45.990 --> 06:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:04:47.430 --> 06:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
all right any
 
06:04:49.830 --> 06:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
further comments questions
 
06:04:51.510 --> 06:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
are just something here i'd just like to
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
close um oh i just like the committee to
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
notice that the those that were in
 
06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to this repeal were all
 
06:04:59.190 --> 06:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
private ambulance companies and not a
 
06:05:02.070 --> 06:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
single municipal emergency service came
 
06:05:02.080 --> 06:05:03.030 align:start position:0%
single municipal emergency service came
forward

06:05:03.030 --> 06:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
to say that we needed to keep
 
06:05:08.070 --> 06:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
this complex
 
06:05:10.470 --> 06:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
which municipality
 
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
lebanon i don't was that in the
 
06:05:13.270 --> 06:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because i didn't hear them
 
06:05:14.708 --> 06:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
in the regular i don't know if they
 
06:05:17.910 --> 06:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
spoke they said right testimony
 
06:05:19.670 --> 06:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
then i apologize i didn't see that
 
06:05:19.680 --> 06:05:22.070 align:start position:0%
then i apologize i didn't see that
lebanon

06:05:22.070 --> 06:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
lebanon
 
06:05:25.030 --> 06:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i would think that state ems
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
could speak for for a vast majority of
 
06:05:28.948 --> 06:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
the state i don't think they're an
 
06:05:34.948 --> 06:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:37.350 --> 06:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
all right so in that case the question
 
06:05:39.510 --> 06:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
the motion is
 
06:05:42.470 --> 06:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
to legislate which would remove section
 
06:05:47.590 --> 06:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:50.470 --> 06:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say
 
06:05:52.868 --> 06:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
i don't understand
 
06:05:55.670 --> 06:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
the amount of fire associated with this
 
06:05:57.830 --> 06:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill is just doesn't this section this
 
06:05:59.910 --> 06:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem to be warranted the
 
06:06:01.590 --> 06:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
issue isn't that great
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay it's just a comment
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:06:05.040 --> 06:06:06.708 align:start position:0%
all right
fine

06:06:06.708 --> 06:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
fine
 
06:06:09.830 --> 06:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
motion is itl upon section two
 
06:06:09.840 --> 06:06:10.628 align:start position:0%
motion is itl upon section two
and

06:06:10.628 --> 06:06:10.638 align:start position:0%

um i make a motion to pass otp section
13.

06:10:08.948 --> 06:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:13.910 --> 06:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:16.150 --> 06:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
would you speak to your motion um yeah
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
sure this is something we're trying to
 
06:10:20.470 --> 06:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
move into statute
 
06:10:20.480 --> 06:10:21.750 align:start position:0%
move into statute
because

06:10:21.750 --> 06:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:10:23.030 --> 06:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's been partially in the rules it's
 
06:10:25.270 --> 06:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
been partially delegated to towns and
 
06:10:27.190 --> 06:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's very inconsistent
 
06:10:29.270 --> 06:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
um days from town to town sometimes day
 
06:10:31.510 --> 06:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
to day depending on
 
06:10:33.910 --> 06:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
who the manager the health manager in
 
06:10:35.910 --> 06:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
charge of the town is
 
06:10:37.910 --> 06:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a good idea to
 
06:10:39.830 --> 06:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
help small shops
 
06:10:42.390 --> 06:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
with actually hiring teenagers
 
06:10:43.270 --> 06:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:10:46.150 --> 06:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
and i i'd like to say that
 
06:10:50.230 --> 06:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes they're granting waivers on this but
 
06:10:52.948 --> 06:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
i think it is important when we see that
 
06:10:54.470 --> 06:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
06:10:55.430 --> 06:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
places in the same position
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
that instead of relying on a waiver we
 
06:11:03.590 --> 06:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
specifically say
 
06:11:05.750 --> 06:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
these this type of
 
06:11:05.760 --> 06:11:10.150 align:start position:0%
these this type of
uh

06:11:10.150 --> 06:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:10.160 --> 06:11:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
business

06:11:11.910 --> 06:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:11:13.670 --> 06:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know the waivers aren't
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
necessary we'll just accept them off the
 
06:11:16.160 --> 06:11:17.670 align:start position:0%
necessary we'll just accept them off the
top

06:11:17.670 --> 06:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
top
 
06:11:20.310 --> 06:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
and for example
 
06:11:22.708 --> 06:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
right now if you're in a restaurant with
 
06:11:24.788 --> 06:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
a significant bar business
 
06:11:27.350 --> 06:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
your restaurant the kitchen may close
 
06:11:30.150 --> 06:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
down hours before the rest
 
06:11:32.310 --> 06:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
this would allow your food protection
 
06:11:34.708 --> 06:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
manager to leave when the kitchen closes
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
instead of being stuck there until one
 
06:11:38.868 --> 06:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning every night
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
and so i think that's a
 
06:11:45.270 --> 06:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
very reasonable accommodation
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
so i'm fully in support of this
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:54.708 --> 06:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
i'm allegra
 
06:11:56.788 --> 06:11:56.798 align:start position:0%
i'm going to largely say what you said i
 
06:11:58.230 --> 06:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
think that the way this is structured
 
06:11:59.430 --> 06:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
now it just
 
06:12:01.430 --> 06:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
captures two
 
06:12:02.708 --> 06:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
diverse uh
 
06:12:05.030 --> 06:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
a field
 
06:12:06.788 --> 06:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
places that sort of coffee and donuts
 
06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
are not the same as places that are
 
06:12:18.070 --> 06:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:21.750 --> 06:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'm opposed to
 
06:12:23.670 --> 06:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:12:26.948 --> 06:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
there's already a procedure for getting
 
06:12:29.190 --> 06:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
a variance to
 
06:12:32.470 --> 06:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
this rule you just go through the
 
06:12:35.590 --> 06:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
food service bureau at hhs
 
06:12:35.600 --> 06:12:37.670 align:start position:0%
food service bureau at hhs
and

06:12:37.670 --> 06:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:40.948 --> 06:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
they can work with a business to develop
 
06:12:42.390 --> 06:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
a variance
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
that's specific to the needs of of the
 
06:12:46.788 --> 06:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
particular business
 
06:12:46.798 --> 06:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
particular business
and

06:12:47.670 --> 06:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:47.680 --> 06:12:48.470 align:start position:0%
and
this

06:12:48.470 --> 06:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:12:50.230 --> 06:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's and i also agree that it's
 
06:12:50.240 --> 06:12:51.590 align:start position:0%
it's and i also agree that it's
completely

06:12:51.590 --> 06:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
completely
 
06:12:51.600 --> 06:12:52.708 align:start position:0%
completely
reasonable

06:12:52.708 --> 06:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
06:12:56.070 --> 06:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
to give variances to food establishments
 
06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
particularly those that um
 
06:13:02.310 --> 06:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
have only served foods that are low risk
 
06:13:05.430 --> 06:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of causing illness like a like
 
06:13:07.910 --> 06:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
a places that do only ice cream or just
 
06:13:09.910 --> 06:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
like aroma joe's because they only have
 
06:13:12.310 --> 06:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
the coffee and the bagels
 
06:13:12.320 --> 06:13:13.350 align:start position:0%
the coffee and the bagels
but

06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:13:16.310 --> 06:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
my concern is that well i have two
 
06:13:17.910 --> 06:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
several concerns
 
06:13:19.590 --> 06:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
06:13:21.590 --> 06:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i just need to mention that aroma
 
06:13:23.910 --> 06:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
joe's already has a variance
 
06:13:26.150 --> 06:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
they've got they have variances for at
 
06:13:28.230 --> 06:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
least some of their establishments and i
 
06:13:34.310 --> 06:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:36.788 --> 06:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
and so i'm concerned about getting into
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
the practice of putting variances in
 
06:13:39.840 --> 06:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
the practice of putting variances in
statute

06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:13:44.868 --> 06:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
this particular variance
 
06:13:48.470 --> 06:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
might work for aroma joe's but
 
06:13:50.868 --> 06:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
might not necessarily
 
06:13:52.868 --> 06:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
work very well for for other
 
06:13:55.750 --> 06:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
establishments and are we going to get a
 
06:13:58.310 --> 06:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
line of different businesses coming and
 
06:14:00.150 --> 06:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
asking us to put
 
06:14:02.070 --> 06:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
something that they can get a variance
 
06:14:04.948 --> 06:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
for into statute the
 
06:14:07.990 --> 06:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of having variances to rules is
 
06:14:09.990 --> 06:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
that the people at the state agencies
 
06:14:11.910 --> 06:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
who know whatever this
 
06:14:17.030 --> 06:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
um area of of business or practice or
 
06:14:19.110 --> 06:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
food safety whatever it is that's where
 
06:14:21.590 --> 06:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
the experts are they can make a decision
 
06:14:23.190 --> 06:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
about what is
 
06:14:27.750 --> 06:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
a variance that continues to protect the
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
public at the same time that the helps
 
06:14:34.150 --> 06:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
the business be able to operate
 
06:14:37.270 --> 06:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
and this this request came from just one
 
06:14:37.280 --> 06:14:38.390 align:start position:0%
and this this request came from just one
business

06:14:38.390 --> 06:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:14:38.400 --> 06:14:39.190 align:start position:0%
business
um

06:14:39.190 --> 06:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:41.350 --> 06:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
by exempting
 
06:14:43.910 --> 06:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
all food establishments
 
06:14:47.110 --> 06:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
that have fewer than
 
06:14:48.788 --> 06:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
six people
 
06:14:52.070 --> 06:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
handling the food is going to exempt
 
06:14:54.548 --> 06:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
i my guess is more than half the
 
06:14:56.708 --> 06:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
restaurants in this state
 
06:15:00.150 --> 06:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
um is because the people who handle food
 
06:15:02.708 --> 06:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
generally are not the wait staff so it's
 
06:15:04.628 --> 06:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
just the people who are cooking the food
 
06:15:06.390 --> 06:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
and you know there might be somebody
 
06:15:08.310 --> 06:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
doing prep
 
06:15:10.788 --> 06:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
so that it excludes a huge number of
 
06:15:13.910 --> 06:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants it excu it excludes places
 
06:15:16.310 --> 06:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
that serve sushi
 
06:15:17.350 --> 06:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
which is
 
06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
a food that can be
 
06:15:22.070 --> 06:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous
 
06:15:26.470 --> 06:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
and it excludes restaurants that serve
 
06:15:26.480 --> 06:15:27.670 align:start position:0%
and it excludes restaurants that serve
seafood

06:15:27.670 --> 06:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
seafood
 
06:15:27.680 --> 06:15:29.110 align:start position:0%
seafood
shellfish

06:15:29.110 --> 06:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
shellfish
 
06:15:31.590 --> 06:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
oysters things like that i think that
 
06:15:33.910 --> 06:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
06:15:37.110 --> 06:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
this putting this in statute
 
06:15:37.120 --> 06:15:38.628 align:start position:0%
this putting this in statute
jeopardizes

06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes
 
06:15:41.830 --> 06:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
public safety of in particular i'm
 
06:15:43.830 --> 06:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
thinking about restaurants people who go
 
06:15:46.070 --> 06:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
to restaurants
 
06:15:47.670 --> 06:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
and i just think it's it's uh
 
06:15:49.270 --> 06:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to just
 
06:15:51.590 --> 06:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
start putting things that could be
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:04.230 --> 06:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did you call me
 
06:16:04.240 --> 06:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry did you call me
yes

06:16:05.750 --> 06:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:16:09.510 --> 06:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay i have a question about um
 
06:16:11.830 --> 06:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
how does this bill
 
06:16:19.030 --> 06:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:22.070 --> 06:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it does why
 
06:16:23.830 --> 06:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
is isn't that what representative
 
06:16:25.750 --> 06:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
yakubovich said
 
06:16:25.760 --> 06:16:28.470 align:start position:0%
yakubovich said
yeah

06:16:28.470 --> 06:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:30.868 --> 06:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
please then i believe small shops will
 
06:16:32.868 --> 06:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
be able to do so
 
06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
coffee shops where no me uh major
 
06:16:38.470 --> 06:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
expertise is needed to cook food
 
06:16:42.150 --> 06:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:46.150 --> 06:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay so follow up follow up
 
06:16:49.030 --> 06:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
um so in the first section we're saying
 
06:16:49.040 --> 06:16:50.070 align:start position:0%
um so in the first section we're saying
that

06:16:50.070 --> 06:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
we don't there there does not need to be
 
06:16:56.310 --> 06:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:56.320 --> 06:17:00.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:17:00.628 --> 06:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:03.910 --> 06:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
when i'm sorry in section b
 
06:17:05.510 --> 06:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
there doesn't need to be a food manager
 
06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
there when there's no food being
 
06:17:09.030 --> 06:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
prepared that's what we're saying in
 
06:17:09.040 --> 06:17:09.990 align:start position:0%
prepared that's what we're saying in
section

06:17:09.990 --> 06:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
06:17:11.510 --> 06:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
in section one
 
06:17:11.520 --> 06:17:13.590 align:start position:0%
in section one
right

06:17:13.590 --> 06:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:17:15.670 --> 06:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
and then what we're saying is it doesn't
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
need to be a food manager there
 
06:17:21.190 --> 06:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
if the food is already prepared
 
06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:24.638 --> 06:17:25.590 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:17:25.590 --> 06:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:17:25.600 --> 06:17:26.548 align:start position:0%
right
correct

06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:17:29.750 --> 06:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
correct that's what it says then we see
 
06:17:31.510 --> 06:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
06:17:34.708 --> 06:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
that's what it says go on yes and we're
 
06:17:36.548 --> 06:17:36.558 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
06:17:42.150 --> 06:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:48.948 --> 06:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:51.270 --> 06:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
the food side this was if there's five
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
food employees there
 
06:17:55.430 --> 06:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
the food manager food protection manager
 
06:17:57.750 --> 06:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be there but he needs to
 
06:17:59.910 --> 06:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
be available
 
06:18:01.110 --> 06:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
is that right
 
06:18:04.070 --> 06:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes that's what it says
 
06:18:07.110 --> 06:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
so why bother with one two and one and
 
06:18:08.708 --> 06:18:08.718 align:start position:0%
two because number three covers
 
06:18:08.718 --> 06:18:13.350 align:start position:0%
two because number three covers
everything

06:18:13.350 --> 06:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:17.110 --> 06:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
even a very large restaurant with many
 
06:18:17.120 --> 06:18:18.470 align:start position:0%
even a very large restaurant with many
food

06:18:18.470 --> 06:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
food
 
06:18:21.190 --> 06:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
preparation employees
 
06:18:23.430 --> 06:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
might well want to let the food
 
06:18:25.510 --> 06:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
protection manager take the evening off
 
06:18:28.708 --> 06:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
after the kitchen closes
 
06:18:30.310 --> 06:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
well that's not in here because it says
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
food establishment having five food
 
06:18:35.430 --> 06:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
employees or less that doesn't include i
 
06:18:35.440 --> 06:18:36.230 align:start position:0%
employees or less that doesn't include i
mean

06:18:36.230 --> 06:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
mean
 
06:18:42.230 --> 06:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:43.990 --> 06:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
that says that the food protection
 
06:18:47.670 --> 06:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
manager has to be available on call
 
06:18:54.628 --> 06:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:56.548 --> 06:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
yes i understand the medium chair which
 
06:18:58.470 --> 06:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
is why i'm saying isn't it doesn't
 
06:19:00.708 --> 06:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
number three cover one and two
 
06:19:02.548 --> 06:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
no it does not
 
06:19:04.868 --> 06:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
represent the lack
 
06:19:06.788 --> 06:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
i just think that we're looking at this
 
06:19:08.070 --> 06:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
from the
 
06:19:09.830 --> 06:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
exact opposite way should be looked at
 
06:19:12.150 --> 06:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
or at least in some cases we are we're
 
06:19:14.868 --> 06:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
not putting variance into statute
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is narrowing down
 
06:19:20.150 --> 06:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
current statute that's overly broad
 
06:19:21.910 --> 06:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
and then the second thing that comes to
 
06:19:24.788 --> 06:19:24.798 align:start position:0%
my mind is as legislators why are we
 
06:19:27.830 --> 06:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
sitting here being contented with making
 
06:19:30.070 --> 06:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
so many small businesses jump through
 
06:19:30.080 --> 06:19:31.350 align:start position:0%
so many small businesses jump through
hoops

06:19:31.350 --> 06:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
hoops
 
06:19:33.590 --> 06:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
just because the current statute is
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
overly broad and yes they can get a
 
06:19:38.948 --> 06:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
variance but it's not our job it's not
 
06:19:41.670 --> 06:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
our role to be making these small places
 
06:19:43.190 --> 06:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
that should be exempt
 
06:19:44.948 --> 06:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
jump through the hoop
 
06:19:46.628 --> 06:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
of getting a bearing
 
06:19:49.350 --> 06:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
and that's all i'm going to be uh
 
06:19:53.030 --> 06:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
supporting this thank you representative
 
06:19:55.590 --> 06:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair i'm sorry but
 
06:19:55.600 --> 06:19:58.230 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair i'm sorry but
um

06:19:58.230 --> 06:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:02.230 --> 06:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:04.628 --> 06:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your your uh
 
06:20:05.830 --> 06:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
your time
 
06:20:05.840 --> 06:20:06.830 align:start position:0%
your time
thank

06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:20:09.270 --> 06:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
you we won't finish the rest this will
 
06:20:11.910 --> 06:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
be the last section for today
 
06:20:14.868 --> 06:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
06:20:16.230 --> 06:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
oh i was just going to say to
 
06:20:18.390 --> 06:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative allegro we should debate
 
06:20:20.868 --> 06:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
the federalist papers sometime i think
 
06:20:22.868 --> 06:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
it would be fun i do think we do have
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for safety of course
 
06:20:27.270 --> 06:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i just think we're gonna agree to
 
06:20:29.830 --> 06:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
disagree on some aspects of our
 
06:20:31.990 --> 06:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
philosophy towards government and
 
06:20:35.670 --> 06:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:37.030 --> 06:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
all okay thank you
 
06:20:39.270 --> 06:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment that the bulk of
 
06:20:42.708 --> 06:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
this regulation is not in statute it's
 
06:20:44.470 --> 06:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
in rules
 
06:20:49.510 --> 06:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore but statute trump's rules
 
06:20:51.670 --> 06:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore we this is the way only
 
06:20:55.030 --> 06:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:57.110 --> 06:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows do you have uh
 
06:20:58.708 --> 06:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
something bad
 
06:21:01.670 --> 06:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to clarify
 
06:21:03.990 --> 06:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
that it when you look at this um how
 
06:21:05.430 --> 06:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's printed
 
06:21:09.510 --> 06:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
one a the part that says a person um
 
06:21:11.590 --> 06:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
06:21:13.830 --> 06:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
somebody has to be present
 
06:21:16.830 --> 06:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
who's a certified food protection
 
06:21:19.510 --> 06:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
manager uh when
 
06:21:21.990 --> 06:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
has let's see
 
06:21:24.788 --> 06:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
yes during during hours of operation
 
06:21:26.070 --> 06:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:21:30.868 --> 06:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
already in rules and the second part
 
06:21:30.878 --> 06:21:31.750 align:start position:0%
already in rules and the second part
be

06:21:31.750 --> 06:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:21:34.948 --> 06:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
that says they don't have to be there if
 
06:21:38.788 --> 06:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
if there's no food preparation going on
 
06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
is already in the rules so those two
 
06:21:46.150 --> 06:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
things are not changing anything the
 
06:21:49.190 --> 06:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
change comes with item number two and
 
06:21:51.270 --> 06:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
three that says
 
06:21:53.110 --> 06:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
you know this they need somebody on
 
06:21:55.110 --> 06:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
staff but he doesn't have to be there
 
06:21:57.830 --> 06:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
all the time that's new
 
06:21:57.840 --> 06:21:58.708 align:start position:0%
all the time that's new
and

06:21:58.708 --> 06:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:01.590 --> 06:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
and and i point out that
 
06:22:03.750 --> 06:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
it says they don't have to they're on
 
06:22:06.150 --> 06:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
staff but they don't have to be there
 
06:22:08.548 --> 06:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
it's like well how often do they have to
 
06:22:11.110 --> 06:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
even visit the place can they visit just
 
06:22:12.628 --> 06:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
once a year
 
06:22:16.150 --> 06:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
and um the second part about
 
06:22:18.470 --> 06:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
the exemption of
 
06:22:22.310 --> 06:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
five or under food handlers that's
 
06:22:25.750 --> 06:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
new that's different from the rules so
 
06:22:27.670 --> 06:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
the first two are already in the rules
 
06:22:29.510 --> 06:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
the second two are
 
06:22:31.350 --> 06:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
are really what we're debating because
 
06:22:34.390 --> 06:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's the thing that's making a change
 
06:22:41.270 --> 06:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:43.670 --> 06:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair if this is already
 
06:22:44.948 --> 06:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
in rules
 
06:22:49.030 --> 06:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
then why not just change the rules
 
06:22:51.590 --> 06:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
or or amend the rules and not go through
 
06:22:54.310 --> 06:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
this process
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
at least partly representative because
 
06:23:03.110 --> 06:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:05.750 --> 06:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
all we can do is ask
 
06:23:07.990 --> 06:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
the agency to change the rules
 
06:23:09.430 --> 06:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
and there is no
 
06:23:11.750 --> 06:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they will understand our
 
06:23:11.760 --> 06:23:17.190 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they will understand our
concerns

06:23:17.190 --> 06:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:18.868 --> 06:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
but in other times
 
06:23:20.548 --> 06:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
we allow
 
06:23:23.030 --> 06:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
rules to make their own decisions so i
 
06:23:24.788 --> 06:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
don't know why we're not allowing that
 
06:23:24.798 --> 06:23:27.910 align:start position:0%
don't know why we're not allowing that
now

06:23:27.910 --> 06:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:29.350 --> 06:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's a good question you'll have to
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
wonder i mean the point is what should
 
06:23:34.868 --> 06:23:34.878 align:start position:0%
be in statute what should be in rules
 
06:23:36.830 --> 06:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
work is
 
06:23:40.628 --> 06:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
a is a complicated issue but
 
06:23:44.070 --> 06:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
i for one prefer to give the agency
 
06:23:46.868 --> 06:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
better guidance than
 
06:23:46.878 --> 06:23:48.390 align:start position:0%
better guidance than
uh

06:23:48.390 --> 06:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:23:50.708 --> 06:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
some than some people who write laws and
 
06:23:52.868 --> 06:23:52.878 align:start position:0%
i think they should be
 
06:23:56.070 --> 06:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
aware of and responsive to legislative
 
06:23:56.080 --> 06:23:59.030 align:start position:0%
aware of and responsive to legislative
concerns

06:23:59.030 --> 06:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:01.830 --> 06:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
you are free to take a different opinion
 
06:24:04.548 --> 06:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
and there are in fact rules on this that
 
06:24:07.990 --> 06:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
are actually not being enforced for
 
06:24:09.990 --> 06:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
smaller operations
 
06:24:11.430 --> 06:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i
 
06:24:13.750 --> 06:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
strongly disagree with
 
06:24:17.110 --> 06:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
relying on selective prosecution
 
06:24:17.120 --> 06:24:18.628 align:start position:0%
relying on selective prosecution
to

06:24:18.628 --> 06:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:24:18.638 --> 06:24:19.670 align:start position:0%
to
uh

06:24:19.670 --> 06:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:24:21.510 --> 06:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with an issue that should be
 
06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
settled by
 
06:24:25.670 --> 06:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions and
 
06:24:27.990 --> 06:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
necessary variances and this is an
 
06:24:28.000 --> 06:24:30.150 align:start position:0%
necessary variances and this is an
exemption

06:24:30.150 --> 06:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
06:24:32.470 --> 06:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i do think that this kind of
 
06:24:34.788 --> 06:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
debate is important to have
 
06:24:37.190 --> 06:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate
 
06:24:40.230 --> 06:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
your response thank you madam chair
 
06:24:40.240 --> 06:24:41.030 align:start position:0%
your response thank you madam chair
other

06:24:41.030 --> 06:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
concerns questions
 
06:24:45.670 --> 06:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
represent scitec
 
06:24:48.310 --> 06:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
would any business fulfilling two and
 
06:24:51.590 --> 06:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
three be denied a waiver
 
06:24:53.670 --> 06:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
if the waiver is essentially automatic
 
06:24:55.190 --> 06:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
why don't we why
 
06:24:55.200 --> 06:24:55.990 align:start position:0%
why don't we why
would

06:24:55.990 --> 06:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:24:57.990 --> 06:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
we put people through the waiver process
 
06:24:59.750 --> 06:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
why don't we just testify for one thing
 
06:25:02.470 --> 06:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
it also this would if it's in statute
 
06:25:04.868 --> 06:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
it also applies to
 
06:25:07.190 --> 06:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
cities and other municipalities that
 
06:25:09.990 --> 06:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
have their own food service rules
 
06:25:11.750 --> 06:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
the waiver is only
 
06:25:13.590 --> 06:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
06:25:15.750 --> 06:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
it does not apply in a city such as
 
06:25:18.948 --> 06:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
comfort that has its own inspection
 
06:25:18.958 --> 06:25:19.990 align:start position:0%
comfort that has its own inspection
so

06:25:19.990 --> 06:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:21.830 --> 06:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
make something more severe more
 
06:25:24.708 --> 06:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
respective congress could do that right
 
06:25:26.548 --> 06:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
or they could deny a waiver that was
 
06:25:28.470 --> 06:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
approved by the state
 
06:25:30.150 --> 06:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
what town does representative fellows
 
06:25:32.310 --> 06:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
live in
 
06:25:34.628 --> 06:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it's a city
 
06:25:36.470 --> 06:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
but i mean it depends on whether people
 
06:25:37.750 --> 06:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
are available
 
06:25:40.548 --> 06:25:40.558 align:start position:0%
the town of epsom had a food sanitation
 
06:25:40.558 --> 06:25:53.430 align:start position:0%
the town of epsom had a food sanitation
manager

06:25:53.430 --> 06:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:55.510 --> 06:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes i live in holderness
 
06:25:56.830 --> 06:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
which is near
 
06:25:58.708 --> 06:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
plymouth and
 
06:26:00.230 --> 06:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
almost all the restaurants i can think
 
06:26:00.240 --> 06:26:00.948 align:start position:0%
almost all the restaurants i can think
of

06:26:00.948 --> 06:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:26:03.510 --> 06:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the exception maybe one has five or
 
06:26:03.520 --> 06:26:04.390 align:start position:0%
with the exception maybe one has five or
less

06:26:04.390 --> 06:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
less
 
06:26:07.430 --> 06:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
but my what i really wanted to say was
 
06:26:10.548 --> 06:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
that because this is buried in this
 
06:26:14.070 --> 06:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill we we didn't hear
 
06:26:16.390 --> 06:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
any testimony from any food
 
06:26:20.310 --> 06:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
establishment other than aroma joes
 
06:26:23.910 --> 06:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
and if we go through rules process
 
06:26:23.920 --> 06:26:24.868 align:start position:0%
and if we go through rules process
then

06:26:24.868 --> 06:26:24.878 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:26:27.430 --> 06:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
i think that the people in in the food
 
06:26:30.390 --> 06:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
industry will have more notice and will
 
06:26:33.990 --> 06:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
be able to make um comments about you
 
06:26:37.030 --> 06:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
know what they think of this rule
 
06:26:37.040 --> 06:26:38.230 align:start position:0%
know what they think of this rule
and

06:26:38.230 --> 06:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:39.750 --> 06:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows i don't know
 
06:26:41.990 --> 06:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
about you but i spoke to the managers
 
06:26:43.190 --> 06:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
and owners
 
06:26:46.070 --> 06:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
of several food service establishments
 
06:26:48.230 --> 06:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
and they their basic response was oh
 
06:26:50.470 --> 06:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
please do it
 
06:26:50.480 --> 06:26:51.270 align:start position:0%
please do it
so

06:26:51.270 --> 06:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:26:51.280 --> 06:26:53.030 align:start position:0%
so
uh

06:26:53.030 --> 06:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:26:54.390 --> 06:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's i ca
 
06:26:56.230 --> 06:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's all i can say about yours
 
06:26:58.468 --> 06:26:58.478 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
06:27:00.230 --> 06:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
i i could be mistaken but i seem to
 
06:27:01.750 --> 06:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
recall we heard from the restaurant
 
06:27:01.760 --> 06:27:03.110 align:start position:0%
recall we heard from the restaurant
association
