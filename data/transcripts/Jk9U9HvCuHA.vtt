thank you madam chair um going to keep
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
this very brief House Bill 1660 quite
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
simply would
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
explicitly uh exclude coverage of
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
transgender surgery for minors in the
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh despite
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
statements that we've heard that it's
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
not happening in New Hampshire I think
 
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
in uh previous hearings before this
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee and executive sessions uh it
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
is quite apparent that um healthc care
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
providers throughout the state of New
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are at the very least
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
advertising such
 
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.110 align:start position:0%
advertising such
Services

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
um if uh if we were to pass this we
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
would join 11 other states that
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
explicitly prohibit coverage um three of
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
those only explic
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
explicitly exclude coverage for
 
00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
transgender surgery for minors the other
 
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
eight exclude transgender surgery for
 
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.990 align:start position:0%
eight exclude transgender surgery for
all

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
ages um um another 12 States and three
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
territories have no explicit
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
policy that excludes that concludes my
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
bill introduction I'll take any
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%

you for taking my question my question
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
is uh when we say
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
um any form of gender reassignment
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
surgery are we talking Top surgery as
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
well as bottom
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.390 align:start position:0%
well as bottom
surgery

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:05.960 align:start position:0%

followup
yeah

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
um the other question I had was do we
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
know if Medicaid funds are used for uh
 
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
either breast augmentation or breast
 
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
reduction surgeries um for other
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
purposes I don't know the answer to that
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:30.070 align:start position:0%
okay thank you

thank you madam chairman and thank you
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
um I've heard in so many in other
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
settings here in the house and in
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
committee that these surgeries and I
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
think specifically they're talking about
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
bottom surgery is done in the state of
 
00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:48.750 align:start position:0%
bottom surgery is done in the state of
New

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you just mentioned that um
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
at least advertised as such so do we
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
have any I'm trying to get a handle on
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what is done or not done have we
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire done any
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
um gender reassignment surgery and
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
specifically any bottom surgery not
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics and upper surgery but just
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
any um um uh gender reassignment surgery
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 and any possible and
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
if so how can we get that information
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
because I hear conflicting reports and
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to be clear about that
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I I don't
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
have access to that information so I
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't know what I do know is that in
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
2017 um the
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS implemented a policy through
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
rule that would authorize the state's
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program to cover these kinds of
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
surgeries for um for Medicaid recipients
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
um this bill would
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
simply exclude miners from being covered
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
under those under that
 
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.549 align:start position:0%
under those under that
rule

00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um in and the other
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
question I had
 
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.230 align:start position:0%
question I had
was

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
um if if if we're not doing if are these
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
other surgeries
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
done um say Top surgery you know any you
 
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
know breast augmentations or reductions
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
for other medical reasons other than
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
transitioning surgery if they are done
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um would
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
they still be covered um or not under
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
this bill um this bill expressly uses
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
the language gender
 
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.310 align:start position:0%
the language gender
reassignment

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
reassignment
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
um sex sex reassignment so just a quick
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
followup so that would mean to me then
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
um that this is
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
done specifically I wouldn't say
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
targeting but specifically for gender
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
reassignment including uh upper
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
surgery and would you agree or disagree
 
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
that that would represent discrimination
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
against those who may otherwise have
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
that surgery for for reasons other than
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
transitioning I would disagree I I
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
believe that it is uh within the purview
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
of the state and the state legislature
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
to to determine uh whether or not this
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
would be covered under our Medicaid
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
Program what's an issue here is not
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not these surgeries are legal
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
that was addressed in House Bill 619
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
which is going on to the Senate at this
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
point if House Bill 619 goes through the
 
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
Senate makes it through the Senate and
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
gets passed by uh gets signed by the
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
governor this bill would be would be
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
moot um so this does not address the the
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
legality of of that it simply says that
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
we as taxpayers um should not be bound
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
minors thank
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
you representative kofalt um are you
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
aware of letters that went out to miners
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
around 2017 alerting them to a change um
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
from their Managed Care Organization
 
00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid that gen genital gender
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry gender reassignment surgery
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
covered um this you're you're talking
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
about a letter that went from the state
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
to I'm sorry I'm sorry can you clarify
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
no um and actually it was a a letter
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
that was addressed to um a minor child
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
and she was a recipient of the insurance
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
under the Managed Care Organization and
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
they they were just alerting the child's
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
changes in their coverage and one of the
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
changes was that now um because of some
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
rule under the ACA uh that they would be
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
offering this um so it was kind of
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
advertised to children would you believe
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
that I I'm not aware of that letter I
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
would love to see a copy of it if you
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
could provide me with that
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
representative SE King thank you madam
 
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
taking questions um my understanding is
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
this bill was filed um before HB 619 was
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
passed that is correct in the house
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
would you see any Merit in passing this
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill even if HB 619 becomes signed into
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
law thank
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
you um yes I would see Merit in passing
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
it for for several reasons first of all
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that that we ought to move
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
forward with this
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
bill it I I said it was moot if House
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 619 passes I'm going to I'm
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
actually going to modify that a little
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
bit and say that it it is still worth
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
explicitly excluding uh transgender
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
surgery for miners from our Medicaid
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
coverage um in the event that the policy
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
established under house bill 619 were to
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
change whe if it were to be repealed um
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
that this this would still be in place
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
um representative actually um I'm going
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
to go with representative mlan since
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
we've already had a couple questions
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
from representative Murphy uh thank you
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
question so there there was some
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
questions um with respect to the the
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
Dual nature of some surgeries for
 
00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:18.039 align:start position:0%
example breast augmentation or breast
 
00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:21.799 align:start position:0%
reduction with respect to intent um one
 
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
of them might be just because there's a
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
medical need uh for breast reduction
 
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039 align:start position:0%
another case it might be due to gender
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
reassignment it administratively right
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
now um if you were to have something for
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
example a a breast reduction is there a
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
way to differentiate that either in the
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
CPT codes or anything like that between
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
you know this is breast reduction for
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment purposes and this is
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
breast reduction for other purposes or
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
they all fall kind of under the same
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
umbrella at this
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
point I'm I'm not an expert on medical
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
coding but my assumption is that yes
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
that those would be
 
00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
um covered under separate
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
codes representative Murphy um thank you
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
once again for my question so I just
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
want to be clear this is only for
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
addressing re gender reassignment
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
surgery is that correct that is correct
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
and so my follow-up question allowed
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
would be that if the gender reassignment
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
surgery is a medically appropriate
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
procedure considered so in the medical
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
community when discussed between the
 
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:29.519 align:start position:0%
patient and the family would the next
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
logical extension of this bill or the
 
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
next bill coming down the road be one
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
where they would exclude you know um uh
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
the use or the treatments for hormonal
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
treatment um psychological treatment
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
Social Services treatment for these
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
individuals this bill does not cover any
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
of those does does not exclude any of
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
those things I agree sorry
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative I think you're asking him
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
to read other legislators minds and I
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you want to would you
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
be concerned that this might lead to uh
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
further um limitations on what is
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
considered a medically appropriate um uh
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
process of gender
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
reassignment uh my my concerns focus on
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's the scope of the
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
conversation I think thank you um and
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
I'll actually ask a question as well
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt um would you be
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
willing to consider the idea of
 
00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
including all um all breast procedures
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
both in a redu except for medically
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
necessary reduction because of the
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
weight causing back problems for other
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
children to exclude those surgeries for
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
both um transgender and for others other
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
children as well uh because breast
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
augmentation and um elective reduction
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
um carries risks in in the youth as well
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
I think an amendment that clarifies that
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be absolutely appropriate thank
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
you there any other questions from the
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
you next I'll call Dr Jennifer Smith
 
00:30:11.399 --> 00:30:16.269 align:start position:0%
you next I'll call Dr Jennifer Smith
from

00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
Pembrook good morning Madam chair
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I appreciate
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
your taking testimony um as a physician
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
I'm retired but as a physician I spent a
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
career taking care of people who could
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
not afford regular insurance for the
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
most part some some could but most of my
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
practice ended up with being people who
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
are currently now more of them covered
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
by Medicaid and I might not have gotten
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
quite so poor um had I had that
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity during my career but my
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
objection to this particular bill then
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
leaving quite aside how you feel about
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
miners accessing gender related care for
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
transition um is the same as I had
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
against a bill several years ago that
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
tried to say that Medicaid could not
 
00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:10.590 align:start position:0%
tried to say that Medicaid could not
cover

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
circumcision there were some activists
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
who felt that circumcision of infant
 
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
males was a terrible thing that was
 
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.990 align:start position:0%
males was a terrible thing that was
being

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
inflicted and wanted to have it banned
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
but they couldn't figure out how they
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
would get it banned so they brought a
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
ban against
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fortunately that bill bit the
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
dust pretty quickly because people
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
realized how discriminatory that
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
is and my concern here is part of that
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
slippery slope is next thing we're not
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to allow hormone treatment we're
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
not going to allow the other things that
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
are life
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
saving um and frankly I I don't agree
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
with the premise that 18 is a magic age
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
for deciding that after a very long time
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
going through gender transition you
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
should be prevented from going to that
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
step but you know that's a different
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
Bill and so we'll deal with that
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
separately but the idea that something
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
that is established as good
 
00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
care helping people psychologically
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
avoid the kinds of trauma
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
that ends up with some health plans
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
quite some time ago deciding that it was
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
actually cheaper for the health plan to
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
be covering these than to have to deal
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
with multiple suicide attempts and
 
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so I really think
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
this bill has no place Medicaid should
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
cover everything frankly that any other
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
health plan is required to cover I don't
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
know the legal ins and outs of that that
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
but I suspect that the state would find
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
itself in federal court if they passed
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and the governor signed
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
it um it just doesn't make sense to me
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill is even being
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
considered thank you I don't take any
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions you might have thank you there
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
question uh representative Shapiro thank
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if you could comment on um
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
the effect on the emotional life of
 
00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:34.110 align:start position:0%
the effect on the emotional life of
transgender

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
people as affected by bills like this
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
which limit coverage but also a large
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
number of other bills that limit
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
coverage or limit procedures or
 
00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.990 align:start position:0%
coverage or limit procedures or
limit

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah limit limit procedures and limit
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
um services for transgender people I
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could comment on how that
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
affects the emotional life of people I I
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty severe um I am active
 
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
with P flag in this area and um we have
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
a host of families who have come through
 
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
P flag some of them have moved on and
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
don't need the support system but they
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
are really negatively impacted by these
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
bills their children are scared they are
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
scared for their children people who've
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
already moved from one place because of
 
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.470 align:start position:0%
already moved from one place because of
local

00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
opposition at the school board level and
 
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.109 align:start position:0%
opposition at the school board level and
so

00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
forth do we have to now move out of
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
state you know those those kinds of
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
things are very real um do I know how
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
many of those are Medicaid covered no I
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
don't and I don't really think it should
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
matter and that's my objection to this
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
particular bill is it discriminates
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
against Medicaid covered
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
individuals for something that is
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
available potentially to others
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
although we've heard that it isn't
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
available in this state I am quite clear
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
it is available
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um and I frankly think it
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
should be um and I could go into a lot
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
of elaborate reasons for that but I
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill um thank you doctor I have a
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
question for you um my question would be
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
that um as a doctor you're probably
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
aware that most insurance coverage and
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
especially Medicaid is uh based on the
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
clinical data that supports the benefit
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
and speaks to the balance of risk and
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
benefit of a procedure I was wondering
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
if you could provide us any information
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
any any clinical information on the
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
safety efficacy and risks of these
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
procedures in minors understanding that
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
children aren't small adults and the
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
medical history of children who've
 
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
transitioned early is different than
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
adults that's a complicated question
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
because there's a whole range of people
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
involved but generally speaking these
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
are not things that are done on an
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
experimental basis you know the
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
background is years of psychological
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
care for things and usually if
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
transition is occurring fairly early in
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
childhood puberty blockers and then
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
moving onto pross sex
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
hormones so it's you know
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
since you've pushed me there I'll say
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
the reason I think that 18 is not a
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
magic age is I really feel badly for the
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
young transperson who has reached the
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
point of going to
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
college um and is still feeling like you
 
00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:44.599 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to go to college and I'm
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
not able to be the same as my peers um I
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
just feel
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
that's 18 is not a magic age and in fact
 
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
we also know that the brain is still
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
developing in many ways right up to
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
about age 25 and maybe
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
Beyond um
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
judgment but you still can't just say
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
because judgment is not fully developed
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
that people shouldn't be able to make
 
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
some kinds
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
of choices in their life with a lot of
 
00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:17.870 align:start position:0%
of choices in their life with a lot of
appropriate

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
guidance um you know the the age of
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
being responsible for your own actions
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
in Judaism is
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:28.470 align:start position:0%
in Judaism is
13

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
13
 
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.910 align:start position:0%
13
Mitzvah

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
Mitzvah
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
mitvah that's you know to me appropriate
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that the person goes
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
off and does whatever the heck they
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
please with guidance I think people can
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
make appropriate
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
decisions after they reach that kind of
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
an age and that we're certainly not
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
talking about gender surgery at
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
13 um and then as a followup I
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely commiserate with you about
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
the challenges about reimbursement and
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
the lack of data and the idea that you
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that this is paid for
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
as what you believe is life-saving care
 
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
I worked with life-saving cardiac
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
devices that were not covered
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
until I worked with life-saving cardiac
 
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.030 align:start position:0%
until I worked with life-saving cardiac
devices

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
devices
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry I worked with life-saving
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
cardiac devices that were not covered by
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or insurers without data if you
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
could provide any data about this in
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
this population to the committee I'd
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it I know that you've
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
spoken about it but I'd love it if you
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
could email anything that you have for
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
us I think it's a different bill that
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
you're been addressing because that bill
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
I guess has already gone over to the
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
Senate and I'm I'm reluctant without
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
doing sitting down and doing a lot of
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
up-to-date research um I I do that kind
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
of thing when I need to I have not done
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
that yet on that particular issue um I I
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
know that in the past there has not been
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
a question about that and the major
 
00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:02.270 align:start position:0%
a question about that and the major
medical

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
organizations from the American Academy
 
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.390 align:start position:0%
organizations from the American Academy
of

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics and all of the psychological
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
organizations and Psychiatry
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
organizations don't see this as being
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
something that's problematic so thank
 
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
you okay representative B King and then
 
00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.390 align:start position:0%
you okay representative B King and then
representative

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
missor thank you madam chair and uh
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
since you're a doctor and and you've
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
also talked about the age of 18 being um
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
questionable on whether uh that's the GU
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
the set guideline that we should use I
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could elaborate a
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
little bit on brain development and how
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
many brains aren't especially male
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
brains aren't fully developed until
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
25 I I don't know that there's use in in
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
elaborating that I it's true um there's
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
no question about it I look back on
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
myself before I reached my mid 20s and I
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
wonder how I survived you know I that's
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
I think that's common knowledge now I
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
don't know that I I could elaborate on
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
it I'm I'm a family physician you know
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
my interests are wide I also have a
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
public health degree and I you know I've
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
read a lot of stuff but am I an expert
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
on brain development is going through
 
00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:30.390 align:start position:0%
on brain development is going through
adolescence

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
adolescence
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
no thank you representative missor and
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
then representative Weber yes thank you
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
question so to clarify because I'm still
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
unsure are you saying that um gender
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
transition surgery should be covered by
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid at any
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
age if it were covered by other
 
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.870 align:start position:0%
age if it were covered by other
insurance

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes at any age if that were a decision
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
that had come down for other insurance
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
yes but that decision has not come down
 
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
at any age and I don't think it
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
will you know I think the transition
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
procedure is
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
long the notion that people are doing
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
surgery on young children is just wrong
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
happen follow up well yeah thank you for
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
taking my followup so I know several
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
people who are in the process of
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
actually detransitioning should there
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
should there should that be covered for
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
them as
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
well I I would think so at any age I
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
think anyone who is in need of medical
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
services and has appropriate Medical
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
Care and psychological care should be
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to access that care absolutely
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber and then
 
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.670 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber and then
representative

00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question the
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
microphones are a little peculiar so I'm
 
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
trying to find the right spot
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
um would you agree with me that as a
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
followup to your point about 18 not
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
being a magic age that there may be a
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
child at
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
17 who had been for many years
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
undergoing the spectrum of care that
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
comes with a
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
transition who might well be able to
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
consent with the consent of their
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
parents to a particular procedure where
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
we're we all know 25y olds who shouldn't
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
have care of a goldfish um but that
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
there is a spectrum and each person
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
falls at a different spot on that
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
Spectrum based on their own makeup based
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
on the quality of Family Care they have
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
had based on the quality of mental
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
health and physical health care that
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
they have had and they arrive at the
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
right point in different ways by very
 
00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.790 align:start position:0%
right point in different ways by very
different

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
means I couldn't say it better than you
 
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.190 align:start position:0%
means I couldn't say it better than you
just

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
said Thank You representative kushman
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so as a doctor do
 
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
you agree that um an adult who has gone
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
through puberty and has completed their
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
um their growth in their genital area
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
and all of the tissue development that
 
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:43.559 align:start position:0%
comes with that after
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
puberty um that a surgery to take that
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
tissue and change it into something else
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
is a lot different on a minor or a young
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
person who has had puberty blockers and
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh cross- seex hormones that have
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
contributed to atrophy or uh an absence
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
of development of that tissue do you see
 
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
how that is novel to be and and it's
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
breaking ground to do such
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries as they're very different from
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
adults you know it's an interesting
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
question and I have got a little tiny
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
bit of information that I've heard from
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
people and I know nothing more about
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
that and and I don't think the
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
legislature should get into the business
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
of trying to legislate the minutia of
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
what's appropriate medical
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
care that's what we have all of our
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
specialty societies for there are
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
malpractice laws you know I think you're
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
asking something that I cannot
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
reasonably answer nor do I think it is
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
germine to whether or not you should
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
exclude Medicaid coverage of something
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
that other insurance has decided is
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay a
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
followup thank you
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
um respectfully if if there's no data
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
and we have such a difference in the
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
procedures and how they're done on a on
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
a patient I didn't say you you put that
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
word in my mouth that there's no data I
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
did not say that I said I am not that
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with it
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay um well experimental care as I see
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
it I didn't say that either actually I I
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
think we'll probably stop that line of
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
questioning because I I recognize that
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have that area of knowledge
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
and we can pursue that uh representative
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you madam chairman thank you
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just want to
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
follow up a little bit on uh some of the
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
concerns you express with respect to the
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
the legal Jeopardy uh that the state May
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
puts himself in something like this was
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
to go forward are you aware of any other
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
states that have similar
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislation um and have been exposed to
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
um some of the legal Jeopardy that
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
you're concerned
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
about no I'm not certain about that I
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
think it probably is happening I know
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
there are suits around transgender
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
issues for laws that have outlawed
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
transition care specifically Medicaid I
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
have not heard whether that true or not
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
I I just can't imagine that there
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
litigation seeing no further questions
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much doctor for your
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and with that I have my last
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
pink card in my hand if there's anybody
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
else who would wanted to speak please

get that to me before we're done here
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to represent uh Louise
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
Spencer from the Kent Street
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
Coalition hi thank you madam chair and
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh to the committee for taking
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
my testimony today my name is my name is
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
Louise Spencer I'm from conquered New
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I am uh the co-founder of
 
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
the Ken Street Coalition which is an all
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
volunteer Grassroots advocacy
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
organization um and I am here speaking
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
on my own behalf but also on behalf of
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
the Coalition uh we believe strongly
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
that people deserve access to the
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
healthc care that they need and um we
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
also believe strongly that
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
that decision is best left between a
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
patient and their physician and in this
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
instance between a minor child their
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
parents and a
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
physician um
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
and it's it's in their best interest
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's best to have them determine what's
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
in their best
 
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.630 align:start position:0%
in their best
interest

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.150 align:start position:0%
interest
um

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
so we also believe that people who would
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
other otherwise be able to access care
 
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
should not be treated differently just
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
because they happen to be on Medicaid
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of reasons that
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
people end up on Medicaid and to treat
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
people differently and to create
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
barriers that otherwise do not exist is
 
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.750 align:start position:0%
barriers that otherwise do not exist is
is

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
unfair um this bill is just one of many
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
that have been focused on transgender
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
youth in particular we we've seen
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
another number of bills focused on
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
transgender people in general but the
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
the trend seems to be on transgender
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
youth I've talked to many parents and
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
some youth about the pain they are
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
feeling of having to repeatedly come
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
before this body to justify their
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
existence and their medical needs and
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
forces his people to do that very
 
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.549 align:start position:0%
forces his people to do that very
thing

00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
um again I can't stress just how
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
important it is that doctors and
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
patients and parents are best suited to
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
know exactly what would bring somebody
 
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
point where they think that this is the
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
next step that they need to take for
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
their overall health for their Mental
 
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.710 align:start position:0%
their overall health for their Mental
Health

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
Health
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
um for their psychosocial
 
00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:32.839 align:start position:0%
health I'm not impressed by how many
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
other states may or may not be doing
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
this we've seen
 
00:49:41.069 --> 00:49:41.079 align:start position:0%
instances over and over again when
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
states have had very misguided policies
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
we saw that when states
 
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
banned um interracial marriage between
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
the in the early half of the uh 20th
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
century I think over 30 States out of 48
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
actively enforced those
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
laws that did not make them right so the
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
idea that other states are doing this
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
does not in any way make it right
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
furthermore I am used to New Hampshire
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
and have always been proud of New
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for being a leader on issues
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
and not a follower and
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
increasingly it looks to me like we have
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
been a follower on these issues in 2018
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
we were a leader we adopted an
 
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.349 align:start position:0%
we were a leader we adopted an
anti-discrimination

00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
bill that recognized the inherent human
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
dignity of all Granite
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
Staters we are going backward here and
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're going backward because we're
 
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
taking the lead from some national
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
states I think that New Hampshire should
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
be a leader and not a follower and that
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
we should lead with
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
courage and
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
compassion we should be focused on what
 
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
this state needs and who our people are
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
and this bill goes against that so I
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
urge you please itl this bill please and
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
Restore New Hampshire as a leader thank
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions from the
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative Missour thank
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank thank you for
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I am pretty
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
disappointed to not see any healthc care
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
providers here today because I would
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
have I would ask them this question
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
because we were told previous by
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
previously by them that gender
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
transition surgery on minors is not
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
happening in our state is that what you
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
think is happening as well is it not
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
happening or do you see it happening I'm
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
not a health care provider and I really
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
you don't I wouldn't presume to speak um
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
issue having attended a good number of
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
hearings where doctors have spoken I'm
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
aware that it's the rare
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
instance excuse me where um particularly
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
any sort of bottom surgery would be
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
um the the step taken um but I I can't I
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
I can't address your
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
your question I'm sure there are healthc
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
care providers that would be willing to
 
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
um address that outside of this hearing
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
with you though thank you Unfortunately
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
you um I have a question for you um are
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
you do you know if there are other
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
procedures that are covered by insurance
 
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
and by Medicaid simply by the fact that
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
a medical society has included them in
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
their protocols and clinical guidelines
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
if you think about cancer or cardiac I'm
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand the question can
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
you frame it my question is just because
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
the doctors and the medical societies
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
think something is good like some cancer
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
treatment or some heart disease
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
treatment do you believe that all of
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
those either are or should automatically
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
be covered by
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it's usually not based just on
 
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
what the medical society says um I my
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
husband is a physician and I I did a lot
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
of billing um I worked for his practice
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
um it's rarely based solely on the
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the medical
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
society um it in it's a very
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
complex um set of factors that are
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
determined about when a procedure is
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
covered or not it has to do with
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
diagnosis codes it does have to do with
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
whether something is considered
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
experimental or not
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
um it has to do with um repetition of
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
procedures I mean there are many factors
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
that can come into play there are also
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
appeal procedures so that things that
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
might not be routinely covered are in
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
fact covered when it is necessary for
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
the medical um health and well-being of
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
a person so there there are no kind of
 
00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
formulas that can be applied um across
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
the board that would say yes or no um we
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
have certain procedures you know if
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
they've been found um to
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
be um you know I'm trying to
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
think I was going to say applying
 
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
leeches probably wouldn't be allowed but
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
now that's in fact used for
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
anti-coagulation so I won't opine on
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
that but uh what I will say is that it
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
is a very complex determination often
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
with many
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
levels that patients can appeal to in
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
order to get the care that they need um
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
including experimental procedures in
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
fact thank
 
00:55:10.109 --> 00:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
you representative Missour yeah thank
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking another question um so
 
00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you worked in
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
Billing and so did you see or the codes
 
00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
that were used for bottom surgeries top
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries Etc no
 
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
my husband did not practice in that
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
field of medicine did were you aware
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
they were in
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
existence um I W I wasn't I mean it just
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't my area Okay of I I had no reason
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
to to do that and also our the practice
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
has been closed now for about eight
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
years so okay thank you uh thank you uh
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for speaking with us

today and I want to thank everybody who
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
was here today I know we may have asked
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
a few questions that were outside of
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
your normal Lane but wanted to make sure
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
that we could have the best
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
understanding we could uh given that the
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
turnout was not what I think any of us
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
expected for today um so with that I'd
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
like to thank for everybody who is here

as he cannot be here today I'm here to
 
03:08:43.670 --> 03:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
present House Bill 1693 and act relative
 
03:08:45.229 --> 03:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
to the use of psychedelics for
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic purposes this bill is
 
03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
modeled off of our medical cannabis laws
 
03:08:53.110 --> 03:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
it allows for the medical use of
 
03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
lysergic acid diethyl
 
03:08:59.070 --> 03:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
diethylamide LSD
 
03:09:01.870 --> 03:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
musculine the active in North American
 
03:09:05.910 --> 03:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
peyote Cactus and silos cybin the active
 
03:09:09.150 --> 03:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
in North American magic mushrooms our
 
03:09:10.990 --> 03:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis program has been
 
03:09:13.269 --> 03:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
running successfully without issue for
 
03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
several years now it is a proven model
 
03:09:18.070 --> 03:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
of success this bill looks to expand
 
03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
upon that success by including more
 
03:09:23.190 --> 03:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
substances these substances have been
 
03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
shown time and again since the 1950s to
 
03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
be remarkably effective for the
 
03:09:31.150 --> 03:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
treatment of alcoholism drug addiction
 
03:09:33.269 --> 03:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
particularly narcotic addiction
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
depression including forms of treatment
 
03:09:39.229 --> 03:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
resistant to depression PTSD and fear of
 
03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
death among terminally ill persons to
 
03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
name the most common and best studied in
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
fact it has been shown that in a
 
03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
majority of patients just one quote high
 
03:09:52.229 --> 03:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
dose end quote treatment is all that is
 
03:09:54.349 --> 03:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
required for successful
 
03:09:56.389 --> 03:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
treatment these are not substances
 
03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
intended for long-term therapeutic use
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
although no harm has ever been observed
 
03:10:04.110 --> 03:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
from repe repeated treatment these
 
03:10:06.630 --> 03:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
substances are non-addictive non-habit
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
forming and have an interesting self
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
mechanism to prevent abuse the more
 
03:10:13.950 --> 03:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
often that one consumes these
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
traditional psychedelics the lesser the
 
03:10:19.030 --> 03:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
effect on the user this also holds true
 
03:10:21.630 --> 03:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
for increasing the dosage if one uses
 
03:10:23.550 --> 03:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
psychedelics too often then the effects
 
03:10:26.790 --> 03:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
are lost even if larger dosages are
 
03:10:29.070 --> 03:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
taken the only way for a person to
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
regain the effects of these substances
 
03:10:33.870 --> 03:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
is to not use them for a period of time
 
03:10:35.670 --> 03:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
few of any other drugs have this effect
 
03:10:38.110 --> 03:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
on people the only counter indicator for
 
03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
application of these
 
03:10:42.550 --> 03:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
compounds is for persons predisposed to
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
SK schizophrenia as it can trigger it
 
03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:53.150 --> 03:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
onset these substances were placed on
 
03:10:56.349 --> 03:10:56.359 align:start position:0%
the FDA schedule one in the late
 
03:10:59.389 --> 03:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
1960s as a knee-jerk reaction to social
 
03:11:02.110 --> 03:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
upheaval occurring at that time make no
 
03:11:04.670 --> 03:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
mistake about it we are against the
 
03:11:07.349 --> 03:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
expansion of availability of dangerous
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
and highly addictive substances like
 
03:11:12.269 --> 03:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
amphetamines barbituates narcotics Andor
 
03:11:12.279 --> 03:11:13.710 align:start position:0%
amphetamines barbituates narcotics Andor
opioids

03:11:13.710 --> 03:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
03:11:16.030 --> 03:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
psychedelics have nothing in common with
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
these types of substances and moral
 
03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:24.990 --> 03:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
them we are aware that there are some
 
03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
that have concerns about patients using
 
03:11:28.990 --> 03:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
these substances without immediate
 
03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:29.870 align:start position:0%
these substances without immediate
medical

03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
supervision we contend that it is a
 
03:11:33.790 --> 03:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
decision best made by practitioners and
 
03:11:35.950 --> 03:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
their patients there is nothing in this
 
03:11:37.590 --> 03:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
bill that would prohibit a practitioner
 
03:11:39.990 --> 03:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
to mandate that the patient used these
 
03:11:41.790 --> 03:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
substances under direct medical
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
supervision or under a more clinical
 
03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
setting than
 
03:11:48.269 --> 03:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
home in fact we believe that this would
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
be the most common form of prescription
 
03:11:51.990 --> 03:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
at least during the first or early
 
03:11:53.750 --> 03:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
treatments further it is not
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
unfathomable to imagine that all
 
03:11:57.990 --> 03:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners May insist on use only
 
03:12:00.910 --> 03:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
under clinical settings again these are
 
03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
decisions best left to medical
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
professionals and their
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
patients it is important to note that
 
03:12:08.590 --> 03:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
among these compounds LSD is the only
 
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
compound that is a man-made synthetic
 
03:12:13.469 --> 03:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
compound still tightly controlled by
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
federal law and therefore would not be
 
03:12:17.349 --> 03:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
available for use except under special
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
permit by the
 
03:12:21.229 --> 03:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
FDA there are currently several groups
 
03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
in the USA with limited permits for LSD
 
03:12:25.750 --> 03:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
mesculin and
 
03:12:28.030 --> 03:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
psilocybin peyote only grows naturally
 
03:12:29.590 --> 03:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the desert Southwest of the United
 
03:12:31.389 --> 03:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
States and therefore would have limited
 
03:12:33.630 --> 03:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
to no application in the short
 
03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
term magic mushrooms grow naturally in
 
03:12:38.870 --> 03:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
all 50 states and are easily grown
 
03:12:40.710 --> 03:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
indoors making psilocybin the most
 
03:12:42.269 --> 03:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
likely candidate for treatment in the
 
03:12:44.830 --> 03:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
short term in New Hampshire similar to
 
03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:45.950 align:start position:0%
short term in New Hampshire similar to
cannabis

03:12:45.950 --> 03:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
today this bill is a common sense harm
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
reduction expansion of our current
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
expanded medical treatment options in
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire given the proven track
 
03:12:56.349 --> 03:12:56.359 align:start position:0%
record of our medical cannabis bill this
 
03:12:59.630 --> 03:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
is a logical continuation of that Legacy
 
03:13:01.190 --> 03:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
in an effort to provide help and
 
03:13:03.510 --> 03:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
treatment to those most in need in a
 
03:13:06.429 --> 03:13:06.439 align:start position:0%
safe and secure manner we respectfully
 
03:13:07.990 --> 03:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee recommend this
 
03:13:10.990 --> 03:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass thank
 
03:13:14.190 --> 03:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you are you taking questions
 
03:13:16.870 --> 03:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
or I could take the question and and let
 
03:13:19.269 --> 03:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not I have an answer
 
03:13:21.670 --> 03:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
03:13:23.190 --> 03:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
03:13:25.590 --> 03:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
Ammon for filling in on short notice uh
 
03:13:28.229 --> 03:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
my question is if you're aware that the
 
03:13:30.910 --> 03:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
veterans ass uh Veterans Administration
 
03:13:35.110 --> 03:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
is pursuing psilocybin for PTSD and um
 
03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
that whether if this would be something
 
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
that if we were to pass it or study it
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
to better tailor it to its needs that
 
03:13:43.150 --> 03:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
this legislation would be needed in
 
03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
order to open up the potential for
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
psilocybin for PTSD in our veteran
 
03:13:51.550 --> 03:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
population thank you for the question
 
03:13:52.950 --> 03:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not intimately familiar with the
 
03:13:56.469 --> 03:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
matter um but uh I have met veterans who
 
03:13:59.830 --> 03:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
had PTSD and use psychedelics to treat
 
03:14:02.229 --> 03:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
their PTSD there's a there's a group
 
03:14:04.510 --> 03:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
called maps
 
03:14:07.229 --> 03:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
maps I can't remember what the what it
 
03:14:09.309 --> 03:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
stands for but it it's it was the
 
03:14:11.070 --> 03:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative of that organization whom
 
03:14:12.670 --> 03:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
I met I think it was in rested in
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
Virginia at one point um was a veteran
 
03:14:17.670 --> 03:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
had PTSD experienced a very traumatic
 
03:14:21.870 --> 03:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
event in battle and was an advocate for
 
03:14:23.830 --> 03:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh doing what this legislation would do
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative
 
03:14:30.389 --> 03:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:14:32.510 --> 03:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so one of the
 
03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
things that you talked about which is
 
03:14:36.510 --> 03:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
different from the Cannabis is the
 
03:14:39.030 --> 03:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
Cannabis is more of a long-term kind of
 
03:14:41.389 --> 03:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
thing and you know you mentioned the
 
03:14:43.830 --> 03:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
fact that the the therapy that would
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
involve this kind of treatment would be
 
03:14:48.590 --> 03:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
high dose and in fact over extended
 
03:14:51.870 --> 03:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
period uh the effects kind of wean away
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
so what the bill does is it says it kind
 
03:14:56.670 --> 03:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
of looks like it's setting up a registry
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
where you have a registry card since you
 
03:15:01.630 --> 03:15:01.640 align:start position:0%
know you wouldn't be looking at having
 
03:15:03.990 --> 03:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
like a long-term thing like cannabis
 
03:15:05.950 --> 03:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
would you be happy with just having the
 
03:15:09.510 --> 03:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
ability to prescribe um the drug in
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
these conditions you know on a limited
 
03:15:13.870 --> 03:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
basis as opposed to having a registry
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
card or do you think that you need to
 
03:15:18.630 --> 03:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
have the registry card thank you for the
 
03:15:20.870 --> 03:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
question I just want to make it clear I
 
03:15:23.070 --> 03:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
don't think I'm a sponsor on this bill
 
03:15:26.469 --> 03:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure I'm not um and the words
 
03:15:29.070 --> 03:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
that I read were written for me by the
 
03:15:31.469 --> 03:15:31.479 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor so those were not my exact
 
03:15:33.469 --> 03:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
words although I I share some of the
 
03:15:37.189 --> 03:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
sentiments um to answer your question
 
03:15:39.309 --> 03:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in this field but the
 
03:15:42.670 --> 03:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
the mind is a mysterious organ right and
 
03:15:44.990 --> 03:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it gets because of traumatic
 
03:15:47.870 --> 03:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
events uh you know seeing your buddies
 
03:15:50.349 --> 03:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh killed in war or some other childhood
 
03:15:53.070 --> 03:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
trauma it gets locked in a certain state
 
03:15:55.189 --> 03:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
right it's a it's a it's a neural
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
network and neural networks can get
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
locked in something called a local
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
Minima that's kind of like a computer
 
03:16:02.830 --> 03:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
science term but it gets locked in a
 
03:16:04.830 --> 03:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
state that it can't break out of on its
 
03:16:07.189 --> 03:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
own and what these drugs do in my
 
03:16:09.150 --> 03:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
understanding my Layman's understanding
 
03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
is they sort of allow it to establish
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
allow your brain to establish new types
 
03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
of connections to sort of like get out
 
03:16:18.309 --> 03:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
of that that stuck State and based on
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
what was written for me it sounds like
 
03:16:22.590 --> 03:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
it only needs uh potentially only needs
 
03:16:25.830 --> 03:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
a few treatments as you mentioned um but
 
03:16:27.389 --> 03:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
but I think the important thing is it
 
03:16:29.830 --> 03:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
has to be guided by a professional right
 
03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
you need someone there with you in the
 
03:16:34.229 --> 03:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
room so that if you experience a
 
03:16:36.750 --> 03:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
frightening event you know reliving some
 
03:16:38.349 --> 03:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
traumatic event that there's someone
 
03:16:40.630 --> 03:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
there who's experienced on how to handle
 
03:16:43.150 --> 03:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
that so that that would be
 
03:16:45.670 --> 03:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh the way I would understand it follow
 
03:16:48.309 --> 03:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
up thank you and so I recognize you're
 
03:16:50.710 --> 03:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
not uh the prime sponsor and so maybe
 
03:16:53.670 --> 03:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
you're not but it sounds like then that
 
03:16:56.110 --> 03:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
you would be you don't necessarily need
 
03:16:58.150 --> 03:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
the registry card as long as I have the
 
03:17:01.510 --> 03:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
ability to prescribe it and if I want to
 
03:17:06.110 --> 03:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:09.229 --> 03:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
manner uh that's how I understand it I I
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
understand it the same way that you do
 
03:17:14.990 --> 03:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah sentive Weber thank you Mr chairman
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh this is more of a would
 
03:17:18.630 --> 03:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
you believe question would you believe
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
that the problem with having providers
 
03:17:25.189 --> 03:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
prescribe is that prescribe licensed
 
03:17:28.830 --> 03:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
providers can't prescribe these things
 
03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
because it is illegal for them to do so
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
and they would like to keep their
 
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
license which is why the Cannabis
 
03:17:39.710 --> 03:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
program was set up that the licensed
 
03:17:42.790 --> 03:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
provider certifies the exist existence
 
03:17:44.269 --> 03:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
of a
 
03:17:49.429 --> 03:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
condition and it is the provider of the
 
03:17:52.750 --> 03:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
Cannabis or in this case the substance
 
03:17:55.710 --> 03:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
that then deals with the issue of type
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
and dosage and all the rest of it
 
03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
because the providers can't do that
 
03:18:02.150 --> 03:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
would would you be interested to learn
 
03:18:04.189 --> 03:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
that I would be interested to learn that
 
03:18:06.630 --> 03:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um and and it makes it jogs
 
03:18:09.710 --> 03:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
thoughts in in my um mind too that we
 
03:18:12.590 --> 03:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
see when we go to uh Manchester or even
 
03:18:14.469 --> 03:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
in conquered we we have a homeless
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
problem and some of those homeless
 
03:18:19.990 --> 03:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
people have mental issues and some of
 
03:18:22.150 --> 03:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
those mental issues are from tra trauma
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
you maybe they were veterans um if if
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
there is a way to treat their condition
 
03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
in a clinical setting and and you know
 
03:18:32.910 --> 03:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
provide relief in a short term maybe
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
some of those people could become more
 
03:18:38.469 --> 03:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh functional members of society um and
 
03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
there there is some evidence out there
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
that an approach like this may help help
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
some people
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman also
 
03:18:49.870 --> 03:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:52.309 --> 03:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative taking the
 
03:18:54.630 --> 03:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
question in regards to trying to
 
03:18:58.510 --> 03:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
establish another oversight board what
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts
 
03:19:03.030 --> 03:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
on having the existing cannabis board
 
03:19:05.189 --> 03:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
become the body that sort of oversees
 
03:19:07.630 --> 03:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
this versus trying to create another um
 
03:19:10.630 --> 03:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
government um another government agency
 
03:19:13.150 --> 03:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
if you will I think that that sounds
 
03:19:17.150 --> 03:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
like a fine idea to um to not create new
 
03:19:18.910 --> 03:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy but you know repurpose
 
03:19:21.189 --> 03:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
existing I like that idea and again this
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
this is just my personal thoughts um
 
03:19:24.910 --> 03:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting on this bill just like
 
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
you you will I'm just giving you my my
 
03:19:30.189 --> 03:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
opinions that's all follow up if I could
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
also in regards to following up repesent
 
03:19:36.750 --> 03:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
of Weber um I do think the use of it in
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
a clinical setting makes a lot of sense
 
03:19:42.269 --> 03:19:42.279 align:start position:0%
but to follow on representative Weber's
 
03:19:45.150 --> 03:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
comment is the legality of it is that if
 
03:19:46.830 --> 03:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
you get into a clinic whether it's
 
03:19:49.070 --> 03:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
prescribed or through a drug order you
 
03:19:51.349 --> 03:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
run into the same issue where a licensed
 
03:19:54.030 --> 03:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
provider really can't order the product
 
03:19:56.309 --> 03:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
through their licenser licenser if you
 
03:19:57.990 --> 03:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
will so it does cause a problem but I
 
03:20:00.229 --> 03:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
think the intent of having some
 
03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
supervision of the patient makes a lot
 
03:20:02.760 --> 03:20:04.309 align:start position:0%
supervision of the patient makes a lot
of

03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:20:07.030 --> 03:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
sense would you believe I would believe
 
03:20:09.269 --> 03:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
that uh I mentioned I may not be able to
 
03:20:12.030 --> 03:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
pull it up here quickly but um there are
 
03:20:14.429 --> 03:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
are experts out there who are working on
 
03:20:15.670 --> 03:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
this issue and working on state
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislation I mentioned the organization
 
03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:19.150 align:start position:0%
legislation I mentioned the organization
maps

03:20:19.150 --> 03:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
maps
 
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
maps uh I can't pull up their website
 
03:20:25.269 --> 03:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
right now but um they would be able to
 
03:20:28.510 --> 03:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
answer those questions that you have I'm
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:35.309 --> 03:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:20:37.469 --> 03:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
03:20:40.590 --> 03:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um you probably can't answer
 
03:20:44.670 --> 03:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
this uh question the the implication of
 
03:20:44.680 --> 03:20:46.110 align:start position:0%
this uh question the the implication of
this

03:20:46.110 --> 03:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:20:48.910 --> 03:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is that this is a
 
03:20:48.920 --> 03:20:50.389 align:start position:0%
legislation is that this is a
therapeutic

03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
03:20:54.070 --> 03:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
useful approach uh to particularly to
 
03:20:57.070 --> 03:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
mental health uh do you know what that's
 
03:21:02.030 --> 03:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
based on who did the research and any
 
03:21:04.389 --> 03:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
Publications that could
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
verify my my day was that this was a
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
terrible um one of my fellow students at
 
03:21:16.269 --> 03:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
but became quite famous for his use of
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
that was it Timothy Larry was that your
 
03:21:22.429 --> 03:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
student right that so that I'm curious
 
03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
as to how this is full of legal
 
03:21:31.110 --> 03:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
protections and what police can do and
 
03:21:35.590 --> 03:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
can't do but that I I don't see
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
any information as to how they arrived
 
03:21:44.790 --> 03:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
therapeutic thank you for the question
 
03:21:50.349 --> 03:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not a clinical you know scientist
 
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
I'm a substitute for the presenter of
 
03:21:55.510 --> 03:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
this bill so um I found the website for
 
03:21:59.030 --> 03:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
maps it's maps.org maps.org there's a
 
03:22:00.830 --> 03:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
lot of information there one thing I do
 
03:22:03.269 --> 03:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
know um we're our state is on the border
 
03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
of Canada and Canada has legalized
 
03:22:09.030 --> 03:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
psychedelic drugs there's there's a
 
03:22:09.040 --> 03:22:09.790 align:start position:0%
psychedelic drugs there's there's a
whole

03:22:09.790 --> 03:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
whole
 
03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
industry of um you you can purchase
 
03:22:14.550 --> 03:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
their stock on the Canadian stock market
 
03:22:15.910 --> 03:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
if you want there's a whole industry of
 
03:22:18.229 --> 03:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
drug companies who have these novel
 
03:22:19.790 --> 03:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
psychedelic drugs that are being
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
approved in Canada for the purposes that
 
03:22:23.469 --> 03:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so it's not a
 
03:22:23.479 --> 03:22:24.590 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so it's not a
far-fetched

03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
far-fetched
 
03:22:26.950 --> 03:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
idea and there's there's maybe there's
 
03:22:30.269 --> 03:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
at least a dozen companies in
 
03:22:33.630 --> 03:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
Canada that's just based on my knowledge
 
03:22:35.870 --> 03:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
Bank another question uh representative
 
03:22:39.030 --> 03:22:39.040 align:start position:0%

03:22:46.510 --> 03:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
testify that might um be able to respond
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%

03:22:50.229 --> 03:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
bill no one else is submitted a pink

absolutely

03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:19.070 --> 03:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
um bill brigh has signed up to speak
 
03:23:20.790 --> 03:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire State Police on
 
03:23:20.800 --> 03:23:24.670 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire State Police on
HB

03:23:24.670 --> 03:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.070 --> 03:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
1693 put your microphone there you go
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for uh hearing
 
03:23:31.150 --> 03:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
my testimony uh as you stated my name is
 
03:23:33.189 --> 03:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
Bill brigh I'm uh with the New Hampshire
 
03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
State Police the major of the uh
 
03:23:38.309 --> 03:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau um I just
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh speak up on this on this
 
03:23:42.670 --> 03:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
bill I've read through it uh once a
 
03:23:45.309 --> 03:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
while back my understanding is is that
 
03:23:46.950 --> 03:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
this would allow for the use of
 
03:23:48.910 --> 03:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
psychedelics not only in a clinical
 
03:23:50.469 --> 03:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
setting but outside of a clinical
 
03:23:53.309 --> 03:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
setting that raises some public safety
 
03:23:57.309 --> 03:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
concerns for us um as in psychedelics
 
03:23:59.630 --> 03:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
are known the reactions to psychedelics
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
are known to be unpredictable um nobody
 
03:24:04.510 --> 03:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
knows how they're going to react to them
 
03:24:08.189 --> 03:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
until uh they start using them which is
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh very concerning even you could get a
 
03:24:12.349 --> 03:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
different reaction
 
03:24:14.830 --> 03:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
a different time that you that you uh
 
03:24:17.349 --> 03:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
use a psychedelic drug as in if you took
 
03:24:18.790 --> 03:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
it in a clinical setting had one
 
03:24:21.189 --> 03:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
reaction you may not react the same way
 
03:24:23.469 --> 03:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
the next time uh that you take a a
 
03:24:26.070 --> 03:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
similar dose um that's obviously
 
03:24:27.950 --> 03:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
concerning for many different reasons
 
03:24:31.710 --> 03:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
the um concerns would be access to uh
 
03:24:35.590 --> 03:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
juveniles underage people um are the
 
03:24:37.710 --> 03:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
safety on our roads uh with the
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
unpredictable reactions to these drugs
 
03:24:43.349 --> 03:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
um would bring a lot of concerns as well
 
03:24:46.150 --> 03:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
as just uh whoever whoever comes into
 
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
contact with somebody having a bad
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
reaction to these drugs um would there
 
03:24:52.150 --> 03:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
would be some safety concerns with that
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
so those were those were the things that
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to to bring up is that I
 
03:24:58.030 --> 03:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
believe after reading through the bill I
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
believe that this allows for the use of
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
psychedelics outside of a clinical
 
03:25:05.070 --> 03:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
setting which is not exactly what it
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
sounded like when the um when they
 
03:25:07.439 --> 03:25:08.870 align:start position:0%
sounded like when the um when they
testified

03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
testified
 
03:25:13.150 --> 03:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
previously representative Weber
 
03:25:14.630 --> 03:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
03:25:17.870 --> 03:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you know
 
03:25:20.510 --> 03:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
if you know what are the uh laws in the
 
03:25:21.910 --> 03:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
states surrounding us the other New
 
03:25:23.189 --> 03:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
England states on the use of
 
03:25:25.950 --> 03:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
psychedelics I'm not familiar with the
 
03:25:28.150 --> 03:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
other states I'll have to do my own
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
research thank you it is a schedule one
 
03:25:32.349 --> 03:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
drug so I imagine that it's very similar
 
03:25:34.269 --> 03:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire everywhere
 
03:25:35.550 --> 03:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and then
 
03:25:37.510 --> 03:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro um thank you Mr
 
03:25:38.830 --> 03:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much for
 
03:25:40.830 --> 03:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
being here it's good to see you again um
 
03:25:42.750 --> 03:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
my question was would be if we were to
 
03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
refer this to interim study to try to
 
03:25:47.790 --> 03:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
figure out how to enable places like
 
03:25:49.510 --> 03:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
some of the hospitals to our South that
 
03:25:51.030 --> 03:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
have established programs for
 
03:25:53.630 --> 03:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts residents to use it or the
 
03:25:55.870 --> 03:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
VA to do that would you be willing to
 
03:25:57.189 --> 03:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
collaborate with us if we were to
 
03:25:58.990 --> 03:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
interum study this and try and make sure
 
03:26:00.349 --> 03:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
that we don't trigger any law
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement concerns while trying to see
 
03:26:05.510 --> 03:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
that there may be an access for some
 
03:26:08.349 --> 03:26:08.359 align:start position:0%
well-controlled clinical clinical work
 
03:26:09.630 --> 03:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
with some of these underserved
 
03:26:12.189 --> 03:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
communities yeah certainly willing to be
 
03:26:14.469 --> 03:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
accessible for consultation and and to
 
03:26:16.710 --> 03:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
collaborate I just I can't guarantee
 
03:26:18.870 --> 03:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
that uh we're going to recommend at any
 
03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
point that we would you know encourage
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh legalization of psychedelics thank
 
03:26:26.750 --> 03:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
03:26:31.469 --> 03:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
chairman um you um may be the expert on
 
03:26:33.189 --> 03:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
this bill um you're certainly a few
 
03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
steps ahead of me because I haven't read
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
the whole thing
 
03:26:39.670 --> 03:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
um do you know where in the bill it
 
03:26:42.189 --> 03:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
03:26:44.830 --> 03:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
what would what a clinical setting would
 
03:26:47.630 --> 03:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
be would look like it like I said it's
 
03:26:49.110 --> 03:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
been a while since I read it because I
 
03:26:51.550 --> 03:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
believe I I read it back when it was uh
 
03:26:55.229 --> 03:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
coming to us for the um fiscal impact um
 
03:26:56.710 --> 03:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
so it's been a it's been a while since
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
I've been through it but my my uh
 
03:27:01.550 --> 03:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
recollection then was that um it talked
 
03:27:03.750 --> 03:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
about uh psychedelics in a clinical
 
03:27:05.550 --> 03:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
setting and outside of a clinical
 
03:27:07.990 --> 03:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
setting some of the language right at
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
03:27:10.319 --> 03:27:14.150 align:start position:0%
the beginning
um

03:27:14.150 --> 03:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:15.790 --> 03:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
a qualifying patient shall not be
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
subject to arrest by state or local law
 
03:27:19.590 --> 03:27:19.600 align:start position:0%

03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:22.439 align:start position:0%

03:27:27.910 --> 03:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
psychedelics and according with this
 
03:27:30.229 --> 03:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
chapter what page are you on Sir uh it's
 
03:27:30.239 --> 03:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
chapter what page are you on Sir uh it's
page

03:27:31.510 --> 03:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:27:34.510 --> 03:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
four yeah if the qualifying patient
 
03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
possesses an amount of psychedelics that
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
does not exceed the following in it and
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
it lists up to 2 ounces so that's
 
03:27:42.870 --> 03:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting that law enforcement would
 
03:27:45.309 --> 03:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
come in contact with a person in
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
possession of psychedelics and that to
 
03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
me says it's outside of a clinical
 
03:27:51.309 --> 03:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
setting just in that first
 
03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph thank you representative
 
03:27:58.429 --> 03:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
03:28:00.750 --> 03:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:04.349 --> 03:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
uh official title is uh major or yeah
 
03:28:06.990 --> 03:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
major sorry thank you
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
sir I share your concern about drugs
 
03:28:12.309 --> 03:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
being used utiliz in the capacity
 
03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
outside of a clinical setting and then
 
03:28:17.590 --> 03:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
creating a problem with Public
 
03:28:20.110 --> 03:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
Safety are you aware of any test that
 
03:28:22.429 --> 03:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
can be taken or administered to a
 
03:28:25.269 --> 03:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
patient or to a individual that you
 
03:28:26.910 --> 03:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
think is under the influence of this
 
03:28:29.590 --> 03:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
drug to document in fact there is a
 
03:28:32.389 --> 03:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
correlation between like we do with
 
03:28:34.830 --> 03:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
alcohol that they're over a certain
 
03:28:38.189 --> 03:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
limit uh so we have drug recognition
 
03:28:41.150 --> 03:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
experts um they're uh trained individual
 
03:28:43.469 --> 03:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
ual within our agency and many law
 
03:28:44.870 --> 03:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies throughout the
 
03:28:47.710 --> 03:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
state that are able to evaluate people
 
03:28:51.070 --> 03:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
um under the influence of whatever of
 
03:28:53.189 --> 03:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
Narcotics and and they can usually label
 
03:28:55.590 --> 03:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
a you know a they can say they're under
 
03:28:58.229 --> 03:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
the influence of a a narcotic or an
 
03:29:03.429 --> 03:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
opioid or um uh psychedelic potentially
 
03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
based on how their body reacts or what
 
03:29:07.950 --> 03:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
they're seeing during the the evaluation
 
03:29:10.229 --> 03:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert so I I can't
 
03:29:12.389 --> 03:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily give you the exact uh terms
 
03:29:15.309 --> 03:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
that are used but um I'm not aware of
 
03:29:17.910 --> 03:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
anything that would allow anyone to
 
03:29:21.349 --> 03:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
gauge the level that they are
 
03:29:25.070 --> 03:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
impaired the level of that would be in
 
03:29:27.189 --> 03:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
their system we can we can tell when
 
03:29:29.790 --> 03:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
somebody's impaired but beyond that
 
03:29:31.469 --> 03:29:31.479 align:start position:0%
that's difficult to
 
03:29:34.150 --> 03:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
determine so I understand it correctly
 
03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
it's observational yes not okay thank
 
03:29:39.229 --> 03:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
you representative McLean did you have
 
03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
your hand up earlier yes thank thank you
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um there was testimony earlier
 
03:29:47.750 --> 03:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
that um uh these substances have been
 
03:29:49.950 --> 03:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
approved for recreational use in Canada
 
03:29:51.469 --> 03:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
so definitely I think outside of a
 
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
clinical setting um are are you aware of
 
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
any concerns raised you know by law
 
03:30:01.309 --> 03:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement in Canada any issues um that
 
03:30:04.269 --> 03:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
have followed uh from uh that
 
03:30:07.510 --> 03:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
legalization I have not uh collaborated
 
03:30:10.150 --> 03:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
with anybody in any Canadian authorities
 
03:30:12.990 --> 03:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
to to Det determin that um so I don't
 
03:30:15.189 --> 03:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
have any specific information on that I
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
I imagine there's similar concerns with
 
03:30:22.150 --> 03:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh Public Safety at times due to that
 
03:30:24.910 --> 03:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
drug representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you major for taking
 
03:30:28.670 --> 03:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
another question um is there does there
 
03:30:30.910 --> 03:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
need to be a certain per se level of
 
03:30:32.910 --> 03:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
intoxication of any substance in order
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
for somebody to be arrested and
 
03:30:36.990 --> 03:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
convicted of driving Under the Influence
 
03:30:39.070 --> 03:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
impairment to any degree I believe is
 
03:30:41.469 --> 03:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
the term that is used so that's that's
 
03:30:43.630 --> 03:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
an evaluation and then can be followed
 
03:30:46.189 --> 03:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
up with chemical tests uh later on but
 
03:30:49.189 --> 03:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
impairment to any degree is the term
 
03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
that is used follow up follow um and
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
then as a followup you don't need any
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
actual tested level in order to obtain a
 
03:30:57.349 --> 03:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
conviction would that be correct are you
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
talking for alcohol or for any for any
 
03:31:02.309 --> 03:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
of the drugs considering that we I I
 
03:31:03.790 --> 03:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
assume that we're arresting people for
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
DUI of all sorts of
 
03:31:07.950 --> 03:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
substances yes it's impairment to any
 
03:31:09.870 --> 03:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
degree if the evidence shows that that a
 
03:31:11.590 --> 03:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
person is impaired
 
03:31:13.110 --> 03:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh while they're driving a motor vehicle
 
03:31:14.670 --> 03:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
then yes you can secure a conviction
 
03:31:18.670 --> 03:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
that way thank you representative McLean
 
03:31:20.670 --> 03:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up on that question
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
um the impairment is determined through
 
03:31:25.309 --> 03:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
a sobriety a field sobriety test or
 
03:31:27.309 --> 03:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
something of that nature or how is that
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
determined yeah it starts with field
 
03:31:31.070 --> 03:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
sobriety tests and then as I said we
 
03:31:33.870 --> 03:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
have drug recognition experts it and
 
03:31:36.750 --> 03:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
that goes further than the the normal
 
03:31:38.750 --> 03:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
roadside field sobriety tests that
 
03:31:41.070 --> 03:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
somebody has to agree to that testing
 
03:31:44.950 --> 03:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
and uh agree to uh the evaluation by a
 
03:31:46.790 --> 03:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
drug recognition expert just like they
 
03:31:49.469 --> 03:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
would agree to have their blood drawn
 
03:31:52.590 --> 03:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
for Chemical Testing somebody any
 
03:31:56.510 --> 03:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
anybody can refuse that um
 
03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation other
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
03:32:02.520 --> 03:32:08.030 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
thank

03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:10.630 --> 03:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
you no one else has signed up to testify
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
an b693 does anyone else wish to
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
testify seeing no one uh I'm going to

close the public hearing on oh I have
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
the online data okay there were six
 
03:32:24.950 --> 03:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
people who signed in in support three
 
03:32:26.710 --> 03:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
that opposed and one that were neutral
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
online and no one uh indicated any
 
03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
preferences on the blue sheet in the
 
03:32:32.990 --> 03:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
back so I'm going to close the public
 
03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%

1693 and open the public hearing on HB
 
03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
168 well maybe by one minute wait a
 
03:32:43.189 --> 03:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
minute one minute

welcome thank you my name is Jackie groa
 
03:34:51.389 --> 03:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
I'm a state representative representing
 
03:34:54.349 --> 03:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 24 the towns of Ry in
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
Greenland I submitted this bill with the
 
03:35:02.349 --> 03:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
um assisted living facilities with
 
03:35:05.040 --> 03:35:06.469 align:start position:0%
um assisted living facilities with
medication

03:35:06.469 --> 03:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
medication
 
03:35:09.070 --> 03:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
distribution um and I want we we're
 
03:35:12.229 --> 03:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
trying to use the same model that lnaas
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
used to become an
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
n&amp; however during the conver
 
03:35:19.750 --> 03:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with several stakeholders
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
it appears that the bill as written does
 
03:35:27.550 --> 03:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
not address the concern or the request
 
03:35:31.630 --> 03:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
and um meeting with them a couple at
 
03:35:35.750 --> 03:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
least twice we came to get we we all
 
03:35:38.510 --> 03:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
decided that a a study committee might
 
03:35:42.269 --> 03:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
be the best way to handle this issue so
 
03:35:43.870 --> 03:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
for example in assisted living
 
03:35:47.309 --> 03:35:47.319 align:start position:0%
facilities individuals who have
 
03:35:49.189 --> 03:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
capability to take their own medication
 
03:35:51.950 --> 03:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
can do so on their own but if they have
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
an issue with taking the cap off the
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
bottle or if they have Tremors and they
 
03:35:59.590 --> 03:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
need help with a glass of water there is
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
only a nurse or an LNA can can help them
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
there is there the a personal care
 
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
assistant which knows this person
 
03:36:08.910 --> 03:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
closely because they work with them
 
03:36:10.910 --> 03:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
every day cannot help them because it's
 
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
not part of the rules so originally we
 
03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
had thought that if we Exempted these
 
03:36:19.389 --> 03:36:19.399 align:start position:0%
facilities from U this requirement
 
03:36:21.870 --> 03:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
similar to what we do with DD facilities
 
03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful however it's not so
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
easy because often times residential
 
03:36:30.030 --> 03:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
these Residential Care Facilities that
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
there their as they're called have
 
03:36:35.790 --> 03:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
different levels of care so it's not a
 
03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
clearcut kind of it's not a clear-cut um
 
03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:41.429 align:start position:0%
clearcut kind of it's not a clear-cut um
decision

03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:36:44.189 --> 03:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
so we got I we all as a together as a
 
03:36:46.750 --> 03:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
group put together this recommendation
 
03:36:49.469 --> 03:36:49.479 align:start position:0%
for a study committee that we're hoping
 
03:36:52.910 --> 03:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
you'll adopt so that we can be helpful
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
to the community there are people here
 
03:37:00.349 --> 03:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
who can speak to their situation and the
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
um the problem at hand but I'll take any
 
03:37:05.550 --> 03:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:37:12.750 --> 03:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
you than you for taking my question is
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
it is it also um true that one of the
 
03:37:21.630 --> 03:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
moving parties behind this legislation
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
was County nursing homes and that the
 
03:37:28.630 --> 03:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
regulations get more complicated as the
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
as the capacity of the patient
 
03:37:32.880 --> 03:37:34.429 align:start position:0%
as the capacity of the patient
gets

03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
gets
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
less that's right okay that's right so
 
03:37:39.389 --> 03:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
that that would be one of the things
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
that would be studied it would be would
 
03:37:44.389 --> 03:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
it be the the levels of care it would be
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
the levels of care and the rules that
 
03:37:49.590 --> 03:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
apply to these levels of care are also a
 
03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:50.389 align:start position:0%
apply to these levels of care are also a
bit

03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
bit
 
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
complicated and could do some teasing
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
out thank you representative
 
03:37:59.670 --> 03:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr there but this is
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
probably a question for our
 
03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian what's really the
 
03:38:04.670 --> 03:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
difference between an interim study
 
03:38:07.469 --> 03:38:07.479 align:start position:0%
versus a study committee in a sense that
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
if we create an interim study we still
 
03:38:11.630 --> 03:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
have a committee get together to to
 
03:38:13.710 --> 03:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
study it where we create another
 
03:38:15.630 --> 03:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
committee I'm just trying to understand
 
03:38:18.670 --> 03:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of timing timing we could
 
03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
actually refer the bill to interim study
 
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
and if people are willing to study it um
 
03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
then they can certainly do that uh and a
 
03:38:34.070 --> 03:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
report would be done by the end of you
 
03:38:35.550 --> 03:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
know whenever our deadlines are they're
 
03:38:37.309 --> 03:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
in the calendar I just don't remember
 
03:38:40.469 --> 03:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
it's October and uh published in the the
 
03:38:43.070 --> 03:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
house uh Journal it there's no further
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
action taken on the bill because we're
 
03:38:47.710 --> 03:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
at the end of the legislative session uh
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
with respect to a study committee that
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
would report and traditionally they
 
03:38:54.070 --> 03:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
report about
 
03:38:56.349 --> 03:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
November and again they would make a
 
03:38:58.030 --> 03:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
report that would not go in the house
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
calendar because it's just a report and
 
03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
then anybody who wants to file leg in
 
03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
either case let anybody who wants to
 
03:39:06.269 --> 03:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
file legislation next time around gets
 
03:39:11.550 --> 03:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
to do that um so I mean you know we can
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
debate endlessly between study
 
03:39:16.189 --> 03:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
committees and interim study but if I
 
03:39:18.990 --> 03:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
might add the the um the document that I
 
03:39:20.790 --> 03:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
sent to you it's a recommended amendment
 
03:39:22.870 --> 03:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
is only start it's only a starting point
 
03:39:25.389 --> 03:39:25.399 align:start position:0%
but I do include all the or um
 
03:39:27.150 --> 03:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that have been involved
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
with the discussion so far and that has
 
03:39:30.510 --> 03:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
been very
 
03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
beneficial good I sure representative
 
03:39:36.670 --> 03:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
wber so if I could go further into the
 
03:39:40.830 --> 03:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
structure of something um if we name all
 
03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
of these people it's a commission not a
 
03:39:46.429 --> 03:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
study committee and that does get into
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
the problem of getting it together and
 
03:39:51.030 --> 03:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
and all of our rules about
 
03:39:53.950 --> 03:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
commissions um the other thing that I
 
03:39:55.990 --> 03:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
think is very relevant in this is if
 
03:39:58.309 --> 03:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's interim study it's only members of
 
03:40:00.870 --> 03:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
this committee that are studying it if
 
03:40:04.349 --> 03:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
we do a legislative study committee then
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
we can um bring in folks from Health and
 
03:40:10.830 --> 03:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services from Ed and which deals
 
03:40:14.189 --> 03:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
with licensing and perhaps Commerce
 
03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
which deals with insurance and that
 
03:40:19.950 --> 03:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
might be a more effective way of looking
 
03:40:23.710 --> 03:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
at it and if we then it appears to me I
 
03:40:25.710 --> 03:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to read all of this
 
03:40:27.550 --> 03:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
but if you have three house members and
 
03:40:29.389 --> 03:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
two senate members and the Senate will
 
03:40:33.070 --> 03:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
reduce that to one um you could set up
 
03:40:35.229 --> 03:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
that committee with the recommendation
 
03:40:37.790 --> 03:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
that they consult with including but not
 
03:40:40.469 --> 03:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
limited to the people who have already
 
03:40:42.550 --> 03:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
expressed an
 
03:40:44.910 --> 03:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
interest thank you thank you for the
 
03:40:47.950 --> 03:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
Indulgence Mr chair sure representative
 
03:40:49.950 --> 03:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
L on you had some information uh yes
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the interim study
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
reports are due October 25th which is
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
one week exactly before the deadline in
 
03:40:59.309 --> 03:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
the proposed um special subcommittee
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
right so I didn't ask for an interim
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
study this is actually for a committee a
 
03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
study committee because I felt that
 
03:41:08.590 --> 03:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
members of the Edna committee would be
 
03:41:11.910 --> 03:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
important to have and I um would offer
 
03:41:15.070 --> 03:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
myself to that study committee to
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%

Living can you press the button
 
03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
please Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:42:02.950 --> 03:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee I thank you for the
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today we have a
 
03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
little flexibility in our schedule so
 
03:42:09.030 --> 03:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know usually we ask people to keep
 
03:42:10.510 --> 03:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
it to three minutes I can give you more
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
than that but try to keep it under the
 
03:42:14.189 --> 03:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
10 though absolutely thank
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
you so my name is Sarah NATO and I'm the
 
03:42:19.189 --> 03:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
owner and the administrator of carael
 
03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living we're a 24 bed facility
 
03:42:25.469 --> 03:42:25.479 align:start position:0%
in Madbury and this bill is something
 
03:42:27.429 --> 03:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
that has come to fruition through
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
several meetings starting last July um I
 
03:42:32.550 --> 03:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
also am the Secretary of New Hampshire
 
03:42:34.510 --> 03:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
Arch the association of Residential Care
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
Homes and we had the opportunity to work
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
with DHHS to do a rules review over the
 
03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
the summer and much of this came forth
 
03:42:46.510 --> 03:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
from a review of those rules the area of
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
the largest concern and uh areas was
 
03:42:51.830 --> 03:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
medication administration and so this
 
03:42:53.870 --> 03:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill is to look at those rules
 
03:42:58.389 --> 03:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
specifically only for HP 804 and HP 805
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living residences so this would
 
03:43:04.229 --> 03:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
not affect nursing homes only HP 804 and
 
03:43:07.309 --> 03:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
805 we are Residential Care Homes we are
 
03:43:10.030 --> 03:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
the home of our residents and the the
 
03:43:11.710 --> 03:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
goal is always to keep people in a
 
03:43:13.550 --> 03:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
residential care setting as opposed to
 
03:43:16.269 --> 03:43:16.279 align:start position:0%
nursing home or hospital level care um
 
03:43:19.389 --> 03:43:19.399 align:start position:0%
to the fullest extent possible the
 
03:43:22.110 --> 03:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
concern is that the current rules
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
through the Board of Nursing that
 
03:43:25.590 --> 03:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
licensees staff who are permitted to
 
03:43:28.189 --> 03:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
pass medication have to cover multiple
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
settings hospitals nursing homes and
 
03:43:33.469 --> 03:43:33.479 align:start position:0%
residential care and they
 
03:43:35.910 --> 03:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
are absolutely appropriately more
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
restrictive given that those lentur do
 
03:43:40.910 --> 03:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
have um opportunity to work in those
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
different settings so where it would be
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in my opinion for an LNA
 
03:43:47.710 --> 03:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
to pass medication in a hospital I do
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
feel that with appropriate training we
 
03:43:52.110 --> 03:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
are Residential Care setting and the
 
03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
rules should be somewhat different for
 
03:43:57.870 --> 03:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
us as opposed to hospitals or nursing
 
03:43:59.710 --> 03:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
homes because they do deal with a higher
 
03:44:02.750 --> 03:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
level of Acuity currently the staff who
 
03:44:05.950 --> 03:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
are permitted by lawn roll to administer
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
medication in our setting are only RN
 
03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:10.429 align:start position:0%
medication in our setting are only RN
LPN

03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
LPN
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
or m&amp;as m&amp;as are medication nursing
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
assistants so they are lnas who have
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
gone for additional training for a
 
03:44:18.750 --> 03:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
certification um and then they have a
 
03:44:20.389 --> 03:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
secondary license called a medication
 
03:44:21.990 --> 03:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant
 
03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
license the concern is that we have a
 
03:44:28.110 --> 03:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
significant work for Staffing issue and
 
03:44:30.349 --> 03:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
while it affects all levels of
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
employment all career paths within our
 
03:44:34.790 --> 03:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
organizations one of the areas hardest
 
03:44:37.830 --> 03:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
hit is those who are able to pass
 
03:44:40.510 --> 03:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
medication the RN LPN and m&amp;as that is
 
03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
where a majority of our facilities have
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
struggled the most with Staffing in the
 
03:44:47.910 --> 03:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
last fiveish years 14 homes have closed
 
03:44:50.670 --> 03:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with the primary reason
 
03:44:53.389 --> 03:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
being a shortage of Staffing and at the
 
03:44:55.469 --> 03:44:55.479 align:start position:0%
end of the day it is really a patient
 
03:44:58.429 --> 03:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
safety issue we need to have enough
 
03:44:59.910 --> 03:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
Staffing and appropriately trained
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing to make sure we are safely
 
03:45:03.790 --> 03:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
administering medication but there are
 
03:45:06.990 --> 03:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
significant barriers within the rules as
 
03:45:08.830 --> 03:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
representative grotus said as far as our
 
03:45:10.630 --> 03:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
ability to even assist people to take
 
03:45:12.830 --> 03:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
off the Caps of bottles to take their
 
03:45:15.229 --> 03:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
their medication um but those barriers
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
to train there are also barriers to
 
03:45:20.670 --> 03:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
training to be an LNA um or once you
 
03:45:22.670 --> 03:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
obtain your LNA license which has you
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
know a cost to obtain that training
 
03:45:28.750 --> 03:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
current rules require them LNA to work
 
03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
for two years full-time before they can
 
03:45:32.309 --> 03:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
apply to take the medication nursing
 
03:45:35.429 --> 03:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
assistant Class A lot of our population
 
03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
is transient mean they do not stay
 
03:45:40.710 --> 03:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
longterm and by by that it's not
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
negative I have some of my best staff
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
are high schoolers who came out of
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
votech programs who obtained their LNA
 
03:45:49.870 --> 03:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
license they have broader career paths
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
many of them are College Bound and are
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
only working for us to gain experience
 
03:45:55.110 --> 03:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
while they're in high school or in
 
03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
college we also have a lot of nursing
 
03:45:59.670 --> 03:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
students and so to spend the time and
 
03:46:01.469 --> 03:46:01.479 align:start position:0%
the money to obtain a lure when they're
 
03:46:03.429 --> 03:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
on a higher level career path um does
 
03:46:05.349 --> 03:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
not make sense for them but they may
 
03:46:07.389 --> 03:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
work for example my Organization for
 
03:46:10.189 --> 03:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
three to 5 years anding during that time
 
03:46:12.070 --> 03:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
I feel they are very appropriate to be
 
03:46:14.349 --> 03:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
eligible for that medication
 
03:46:17.149 --> 03:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
administration training but do not have
 
03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
the time or the money and the resources
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
on top of further education to invest in
 
03:46:22.710 --> 03:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
that while they're simultaneously
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
pursuing Advanced degrees so while that
 
03:46:28.389 --> 03:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
not may not be all of the staff involved
 
03:46:30.790 --> 03:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
in this those barriers and time
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
constraints and cost of getting the
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
additional licenses takes a significant
 
03:46:36.990 --> 03:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
pool of the workforce that would be very
 
03:46:39.269 --> 03:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
capable with training to administer
 
03:46:41.630 --> 03:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
medic ation it is problematic and
 
03:46:43.950 --> 03:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
they're not able to do that so part of
 
03:46:45.389 --> 03:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at with this is to
 
03:46:47.550 --> 03:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
remove some of the barriers to receive
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
03:46:51.429 --> 03:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
training having said that I think study
 
03:46:53.429 --> 03:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
is the best path forward because we've
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
been meeting on this many of the
 
03:46:57.630 --> 03:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and noted as part of the
 
03:46:59.469 --> 03:46:59.479 align:start position:0%
recommended folks to be part of this
 
03:47:01.950 --> 03:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
committee um we all recognize that this
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
is a problem that there are safety
 
03:47:07.269 --> 03:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
concerns I am very optimistic with us
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
meeing that we all have a fundamental
 
03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
belief that this is a significant
 
03:47:12.910 --> 03:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
problem with the Aging New Hampshire
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
population the shortage of work for
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
Staffing limit numbering of nursing home
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
beds that we have to address this issue
 
03:47:20.830 --> 03:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
to keep people appropriate the most
 
03:47:23.070 --> 03:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of care but the
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
barriers to them obtaining the proper
 
03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
training and certification is
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
problematic so I am very much in favor
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill I'm optimistic that with
 
03:47:34.710 --> 03:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
those stakeholders we can come up with a
 
03:47:37.309 --> 03:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
solution that everyone is comfortable
 
03:47:39.149 --> 03:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
with and we can put forth a solid Bill
 
03:47:40.030 --> 03:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
next year
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
here thank you representative
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chair um I I
 
03:47:49.149 --> 03:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
understand you're recommending that it
 
03:47:51.990 --> 03:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
go to a study committee but um going
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
back to the original bill um and you
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
gave quite a few reasons why it hasn't
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
worked to
 
03:48:04.950 --> 03:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
um to depend on medic I don't remember
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
the acronym but medication is medication
 
03:48:13.030 --> 03:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
the m&amp;a m&amp; m&amp; yes medication nursing
 
03:48:17.070 --> 03:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
assistance um but would the lnas who
 
03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
were able to administer these
 
03:48:21.149 --> 03:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
medications or help people take their
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
medications would they receive some
 
03:48:27.070 --> 03:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
lesser but still some kind of training
 
03:48:30.309 --> 03:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
that Beyond went beyond the regular
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
LNA so if I'm understanding your
 
03:48:34.830 --> 03:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
question correctly um I just want to
 
03:48:35.790 --> 03:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm understanding what you're
 
03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
getting to so the lnas primarily their
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
role in our facilities to help with
 
03:48:44.550 --> 03:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
grooming toileting um dressing and so
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
forth they are not currently permitted
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
to administer medication other than to a
 
03:48:52.110 --> 03:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
particular cohort if they are able to
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
accept nurse delegation and receive
 
03:48:55.750 --> 03:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate training so there is a
 
03:48:57.630 --> 03:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
potential for them to receive nurse
 
03:48:59.710 --> 03:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
delegation and pass medication but they
 
03:49:02.550 --> 03:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
cannot pass to the entire building uh so
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily help with our
 
03:49:04.080 --> 03:49:05.229 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily help with our
staffing

03:49:05.229 --> 03:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
situation in the sense that if you have
 
03:49:10.990 --> 03:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
um you have to have an RN or an LPN also
 
03:49:13.429 --> 03:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
on site at the same time even if they're
 
03:49:15.030 --> 03:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
assisting through nurse
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
delegation so um to answer your question
 
03:49:19.870 --> 03:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
if I'm trying to get to it correctly so
 
03:49:22.830 --> 03:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
the lnas do a different role than those
 
03:49:22.840 --> 03:49:25.510 align:start position:0%
the lnas do a different role than those
passing

03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
passing
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
medication so they the LNA would have to
 
03:49:31.469 --> 03:49:31.479 align:start position:0%
go for further education to get that m&amp;a
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
license on top of their LNA license to
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
be able to administer
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
medication so we have several options
 
03:49:41.870 --> 03:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to explore to determine how
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
best to move forward with that training
 
03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
um whether it is uh reducing the time
 
03:49:50.149 --> 03:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
requirement before they can take the m&amp;a
 
03:49:52.110 --> 03:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
or are we going to look at a different
 
03:49:54.750 --> 03:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
path where um an LNA tract is different
 
03:49:57.389 --> 03:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
than an m&amp; track and they can choose
 
03:49:59.189 --> 03:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
either career path I'm not sure what the
 
03:50:00.630 --> 03:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
ultimate recommendation would be but
 
03:50:02.429 --> 03:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
that's why we need to take it further to
 
03:50:05.670 --> 03:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
study did that answer your question sir
 
03:50:08.910 --> 03:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
follow follow up um I can I can see why
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
it needs further study yeah it is
 
03:50:11.920 --> 03:50:13.750 align:start position:0%
it needs further study yeah it is
complicated

03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
03:50:16.189 --> 03:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr
 
03:50:21.510 --> 03:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
chair this is probably more a question
 
03:50:25.110 --> 03:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
to the chair than to the person
 
03:50:27.389 --> 03:50:27.399 align:start position:0%
testifying I see that this is really
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
important um if we go through a study
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee if I understand the
 
03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:33.149 align:start position:0%
committee if I understand the
legislative

03:50:33.149 --> 03:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
03:50:35.550 --> 03:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
calendar this is going to be a report
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
that comes out sometime in October
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
November then we have to have
 
03:50:39.830 --> 03:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislation again
 
03:50:43.389 --> 03:50:43.399 align:start position:0%
next fall work on it next winter and
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully get something in the law maybe
 
03:50:46.389 --> 03:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
by the summer of
 
03:50:49.189 --> 03:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
2025 is there any possibility if this is
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
not an early Bill to have a subcommittee
 
03:50:54.910 --> 03:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
to come together and try to work on this
 
03:50:56.349 --> 03:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
this is not early bill so I mean if we
 
03:50:58.630 --> 03:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
have time we trying to get to in order
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
to try to meet the calendar this time
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
and get something in place by the summer
 
03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
of the Fall is having people in the
 
03:51:06.269 --> 03:51:06.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting with the
 
03:51:08.590 --> 03:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and try to draft something
 
03:51:10.630 --> 03:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
that may make sense versus waiting a
 
03:51:10.640 --> 03:51:13.429 align:start position:0%
that may make sense versus waiting a
whole

03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:15.790 --> 03:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
year this is not an early bill from what
 
03:51:18.790 --> 03:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
I right so we we'd have until what March
 
03:51:21.030 --> 03:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
15th I think March
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
14th I think is the deadline to report
 
03:51:28.189 --> 03:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
by March 21st March 21st so we have we
 
03:51:31.030 --> 03:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
have a month and a half or so I thought
 
03:51:31.040 --> 03:51:31.870 align:start position:0%
have a month and a half or so I thought
it

03:51:31.870 --> 03:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
was I don't I think it is no this is not
 
03:51:38.510 --> 03:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
an early Bill okay so I guess it would
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
be the call of the the chair again also
 
03:51:41.790 --> 03:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
by the stakeholders whether there' be
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
enough interest in trying to work on
 
03:51:45.510 --> 03:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
this during that period of time to come
 
03:51:47.510 --> 03:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
up with an amendment to the bill to make
 
03:51:49.149 --> 03:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
something viable you're you're
 
03:51:53.030 --> 03:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I will volunteer for a sub
 
03:52:01.309 --> 03:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:04.269 --> 03:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
there so I'm I'm looking again at the
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
original Bill and I'm I'm not
 
03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:13.269 align:start position:0%
original Bill and I'm I'm not
understanding

03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:16.469 --> 03:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
why this Administration is already
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
allowed it's already in
 
03:52:22.670 --> 03:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
statute um for people who are caring for
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
community and so
 
03:52:33.269 --> 03:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering why it's so
 
03:52:39.469 --> 03:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
difficult to have it also exist in
 
03:52:41.710 --> 03:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
treatment fac and Care Facilities where
 
03:52:43.950 --> 03:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
there is more supervision rather than
 
03:52:43.960 --> 03:52:45.510 align:start position:0%
there is more supervision rather than
less

03:52:45.510 --> 03:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
less
 
03:52:48.269 --> 03:52:48.279 align:start position:0%
supervision that seems counterintuitive
 
03:52:50.269 --> 03:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
to me and I I I was hoping you could
 
03:52:52.950 --> 03:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
just help me with that underlying issue
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that there's more
 
03:52:55.439 --> 03:52:56.950 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that there's more
supervision

03:52:56.950 --> 03:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
03:53:01.149 --> 03:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
available and therefore less risk of
 
03:53:04.189 --> 03:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
something going horribly wrong in the
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
residential Set uh setting rather than
 
03:53:12.510 --> 03:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.670 --> 03:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
setting so in having met the last two
 
03:53:17.469 --> 03:53:17.479 align:start position:0%
weeks with some of the stakeholders I
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
think the concern is that many of us
 
03:53:21.389 --> 03:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
based on the cuity of care of our
 
03:53:23.710 --> 03:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
residents we do go through end of life
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
so you do have people who are in Hospice
 
03:53:28.710 --> 03:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
at end of life who are are physically
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
unable cognitively unable at end of life
 
03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
to take their own medication so we do
 
03:53:36.149 --> 03:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
have a significant um higher Acuity of
 
03:53:38.309 --> 03:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
residents than the DD homes which are
 
03:53:40.189 --> 03:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
the ones that we hoping to be Exempted
 
03:53:42.510 --> 03:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
with similar to the DD homes so there
 
03:53:44.670 --> 03:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
was a concern about the Acuity of our
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
residents compared to the residents of a
 
03:53:51.429 --> 03:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
DD home and also there are some
 
03:53:54.149 --> 03:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
complications with the current rules
 
03:53:56.110 --> 03:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
through the Board of Nursing so for us
 
03:53:58.429 --> 03:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
to implement some of this it would
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
affect uh Board of Nursing rules which
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
would affect lure of the staff that work
 
03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
for us um so if if we are Exempted and
 
03:54:09.990 --> 03:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
and um I me not be representing this
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
completely but my understanding is if
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
you exempt us it does create some
 
03:54:17.910 --> 03:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about our staff who are lnas
 
03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
how does that affect their lure because
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
when you hold that license you're are
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
held to those rules so unless we also
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
modify Board of Nursing rules um they
 
03:54:30.790 --> 03:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
cannot work outside of the scope of
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
their practice so there are still
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
concerns about them being in violation
 
03:54:36.630 --> 03:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
of their lure because they are still
 
03:54:38.309 --> 03:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
required to follow Board of Nursing
 
03:54:40.469 --> 03:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
rules so that's where you get some
 
03:54:43.590 --> 03:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
complication in the overlap between um
 
03:54:45.070 --> 03:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
current Board of Nursing rules which
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
govern their lure as opposed to just uh
 
03:54:50.830 --> 03:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
trying to exempt us we still have staff
 
03:54:52.750 --> 03:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
that have to follow their licensure
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
requirements does that help address that
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
concern follow up representative Weber
 
03:54:59.429 --> 03:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
well here's my
 
03:55:02.149 --> 03:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
problem the bill as it was
 
03:55:04.990 --> 03:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
drafted as opposed to as you have been
 
03:55:06.910 --> 03:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
discussing it going
 
03:55:10.309 --> 03:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
forward um and I understand all of the
 
03:55:11.910 --> 03:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
reasons you're wound up in the Board of
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
Nursing rules but the bill is drafted is
 
03:55:19.349 --> 03:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
working off of an what appears to me to
 
03:55:22.830 --> 03:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
be an existing statute that talks about
 
03:55:25.910 --> 03:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
the administration of medications by any
 
03:55:28.550 --> 03:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
person employed or under contract to
 
03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
provide Direct Care to pay clients
 
03:55:33.070 --> 03:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
receiving communitybased
 
03:55:38.149 --> 03:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
services and um so presumably this is
 
03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
already happening in the
 
03:55:46.269 --> 03:55:46.279 align:start position:0%
community and if so um either they have
 
03:55:49.309 --> 03:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
gotten around you know it's it is I was
 
03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
assuming as I read it that we were
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
talking about people who were not lnas
 
03:55:53.760 --> 03:55:55.349 align:start position:0%
talking about people who were not lnas
um

03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:55.359 --> 03:55:56.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:55:56.910 --> 03:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:00.189 --> 03:56:00.199 align:start position:0%
so yes so correct so the original bill
 
03:56:04.030 --> 03:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
was drafted to allow unlicensed staff to
 
03:56:06.269 --> 03:56:06.279 align:start position:0%
take a separate training
 
03:56:08.309 --> 03:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
program in a nutshell somewhat
 
03:56:10.590 --> 03:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent to the current m&amp;a um
 
03:56:13.950 --> 03:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
certification course um but having said
 
03:56:17.309 --> 03:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
that how does that affect our LNA staff
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
who are a large percentage of our staff
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
they still would be unable to administer
 
03:56:25.389 --> 03:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
medication so if it were to go for it as
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
currently drafted it would allow
 
03:56:29.429 --> 03:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
unlicensed staff to potentially obtain
 
03:56:31.870 --> 03:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
that additional training but it does not
 
03:56:34.389 --> 03:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
solve the problem that a majority of our
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
staff are lnas and they would still be
 
03:56:39.189 --> 03:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
unable to administer medication
 
03:56:41.550 --> 03:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
so it would help with some of the
 
03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
workforce staffing issues and the safety
 
03:56:45.389 --> 03:56:45.399 align:start position:0%
issues but it didn't resolve it fully
 
03:56:47.309 --> 03:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
enough for us to feel comfortable that
 
03:56:48.990 --> 03:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
that was the best path
 
03:56:52.990 --> 03:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
forward followup so my last followup is
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
what would be the harm of passing this
 
03:56:58.830 --> 03:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
bill as it is drafted so we can address
 
03:57:01.070 --> 03:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
part of the problem and then allow
 
03:57:02.830 --> 03:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
people to come in with the other
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislation going forward that will
 
03:57:08.229 --> 03:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
address the issue of the lnas and and
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
all of those issues of having to wait
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
two entire years before you take the
 
03:57:13.439 --> 03:57:16.349 align:start position:0%
two entire years before you take the
medication

03:57:16.349 --> 03:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:18.670 --> 03:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
training what's the harm of passing it
 
03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
as it is and then allowing that to come
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
afterwards no I would say that that
 
03:57:26.429 --> 03:57:26.439 align:start position:0%
would be an acceptable approach as
 
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
well and then I do think there would be
 
03:57:30.429 --> 03:57:30.439 align:start position:0%
definitely interest in pursuing further
 
03:57:32.110 --> 03:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
so that we're addressing it for all of
 
03:57:34.830 --> 03:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
the staff that it would apply to but I
 
03:57:36.070 --> 03:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
agree with what you're saying I hear
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and and we're not
 
03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to that I think we were looking
 
03:57:42.630 --> 03:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
for a more comprehensive solution all at
 
03:57:45.750 --> 03:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
once but I understand that yes it would
 
03:57:47.469 --> 03:57:47.479 align:start position:0%
help with some of the the current
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
staffing needs and then we could come
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
back and address it
 
03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
further representative
 
03:57:55.750 --> 03:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant uh is follow up to
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
my volunteerism instead of a sub
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
committee is it possible to have an ad
 
03:58:02.790 --> 03:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
hoc committee therefore we could have
 
03:58:05.550 --> 03:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
people meet via Zoom um if there's
 
03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
interested parties no we cannot do that
 
03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:14.910 --> 03:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
committee rules don't allow it even as
 
03:58:16.830 --> 03:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
the a hoc committee it's an official
 
03:58:20.149 --> 03:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:20.159 --> 03:58:23.630 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:58:23.630 --> 03:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:26.229 --> 03:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
03:58:31.110 --> 03:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
you for being here and um I appreciate
 
03:58:34.110 --> 03:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation very much um as a nurse
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
and uh I occasionally work in assisted
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
um Assisted Living fac facilities so I
 
03:58:42.429 --> 03:58:42.439 align:start position:0%
understand this need um but as the as
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this bill here I don't see
 
03:58:48.590 --> 03:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
that it as it's written now I see that
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
it it exempts even lnas who otherwise
 
03:58:55.030 --> 03:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
under the um nurse Practice Act are
 
03:58:57.950 --> 03:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
required to work for two years and then
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
um you know get that medication
 
03:59:02.189 --> 03:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
administration CER certification this
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
exempts any person employed or under
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
contract um who's caring who's giving
 
03:59:12.070 --> 03:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
Direct Care to clients in these
 
03:59:14.590 --> 03:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
facilities as written now so then if we
 
03:59:17.630 --> 03:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
made that change then um if there was
 
03:59:20.670 --> 03:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
any conflict with the rules that are in
 
03:59:22.590 --> 03:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
place that would trigger the department
 
03:59:24.790 --> 03:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
to have to go back and bring the rules
 
03:59:27.630 --> 03:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
into compliance with the law um so as I
 
03:59:29.550 --> 03:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
see it now it looks like this bill does
 
03:59:31.309 --> 03:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what you want it to do do you do
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
you see what I'm seeing I understand
 
03:59:34.670 --> 03:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
what you're saying there definitely
 
03:59:36.149 --> 03:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
would be some conflicts for the
 
03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
currently licensed staff but I
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying if it did
 
03:59:40.910 --> 03:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
require it then to subsequently require
 
03:59:43.950 --> 03:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
those rules to be reviewed um that would
 
03:59:43.960 --> 03:59:46.349 align:start position:0%
those rules to be reviewed um that would
be

03:59:46.349 --> 03:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.309 --> 03:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
agreeable other
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you okay
 
03:59:56.790 --> 03:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.359 --> 04:00:08.990 align:start position:0%
 
schar

04:00:08.990 --> 04:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
schar
 
04:00:11.309 --> 04:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee thank
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to address you
 
04:00:14.630 --> 04:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:00:17.349 --> 04:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
1585 uh my name is g k I live in
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
Peterboro uh I am an Advisory Board
 
04:00:24.670 --> 04:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
member of uh New Hampshire Arch I'm an
 
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board member because um I'm
 
04:00:30.030 --> 04:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
retired so I can no longer be a full
 
04:00:33.630 --> 04:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
member of the board um for 37 years my
 
04:00:35.590 --> 04:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
wife and I ran Friendship Manor which
 
04:00:38.910 --> 04:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
was a 22-bed residential care SL
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
assisted living home in new whip in newp
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
switch uh we were forced to close
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
Friendship Manor in May of
 
04:00:50.309 --> 04:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
2022 um because we could not hire enough
 
04:00:54.349 --> 04:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
staff to keep operating uh so this this
 
04:00:55.830 --> 04:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
question at least
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
tangentially uh was an issue in our
 
04:01:02.189 --> 04:01:02.199 align:start position:0%
closing clo closure excuse me um my role
 
04:01:03.630 --> 04:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Arch over the years
 
04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
and i' I've been a member of New
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Arch um for more than 30 years
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and I've been on the board for most
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
of the last 30 years um but I've always
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
been involved with legislation I was
 
04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
either the vice president for
 
04:01:21.149 --> 04:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
legislation or chair of the legislation
 
04:01:26.110 --> 04:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
committee um and my first um interface
 
04:01:28.389 --> 04:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
with the legislature with the house was
 
04:01:28.399 --> 04:01:29.389 align:start position:0%
with the legislature with the house was
in

04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:01:31.990 --> 04:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
1994 um there was a v a study committee
 
04:01:32.000 --> 04:01:33.389 align:start position:0%
1994 um there was a v a study committee
in

04:01:33.389 --> 04:01:33.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
1994 uh to determine what the rates
 
04:01:39.389 --> 04:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
should be the reimburse rate should be
 
04:01:42.710 --> 04:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
for um Residential Care the reason there
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
was a need for a committee was because
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
the rates have been frozen for seven
 
04:01:47.429 --> 04:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
years and people were going out of
 
04:01:50.590 --> 04:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
business um but one of the things that
 
04:01:52.590 --> 04:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
committee did was to look into all of
 
04:01:53.950 --> 04:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
the factors that were affecting
 
04:01:55.630 --> 04:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
residential care and what the cost
 
04:01:58.510 --> 04:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
factors were and one of the big areas of
 
04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
concern was medication
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
administration um and at that time that
 
04:02:04.990 --> 04:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee looked into the system
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
which is used in the DD and the Mental
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
Health Community residents
 
04:02:11.469 --> 04:02:11.479 align:start position:0%
and said this sounds like a good thing
 
04:02:15.070 --> 04:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
um but the committee decided that its
 
04:02:18.990 --> 04:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
principle and priority was rates so they
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
met a recommendation with regard to
 
04:02:22.750 --> 04:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
rates in the in the in the form of a
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
bill um but said we'll take up the
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
medication administration in the future
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
um there was an effort over the next
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
couple of years to do something about
 
04:02:32.800 --> 04:02:34.030 align:start position:0%
couple of years to do something about
medication

04:02:34.030 --> 04:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
medication
 
04:02:34.040 --> 04:02:35.550 align:start position:0%
medication
administration

04:02:35.550 --> 04:02:35.560 align:start position:0%
administration
 
04:02:38.469 --> 04:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
um there was a proposal for a pilot
 
04:02:42.189 --> 04:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
program but basically those efforts
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
failed uh due to opposition from the
 
04:02:46.349 --> 04:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing and the New Hampshire
 
04:02:49.630 --> 04:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association so that was not the
 
04:02:53.590 --> 04:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
time but I think we're long past time
 
04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
there was a story that I I told in that
 
04:02:58.269 --> 04:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
study committee years ago uh I had a
 
04:03:01.149 --> 04:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
resident whose name was Don Don had
 
04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
Parkinson's disease and had a notable
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
Tremor in both hands he also had
 
04:03:09.149 --> 04:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
glaucoma and had to take eye drops daily
 
04:03:13.630 --> 04:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
and legally we couldn't help him in any
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
significant way with his eye drops okay
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
we were told that well you can do it
 
04:03:19.750 --> 04:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
hand over hand in other words he can
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
hold the bottle you can put your hand
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
over his and together you can squeeze
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
the bottle but he has to be the
 
04:03:28.149 --> 04:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
Principal squeezer of the bottle and we
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
would have triy that and they drop with
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
him in the hit him in the nose roll down
 
04:03:34.389 --> 04:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
his nose and fall onto the floor
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
so there's been a problem for a long
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
time um and I agree with representative
 
04:03:41.229 --> 04:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
Weber it doesn't seem like it should be
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
that complicated but I think it's
 
04:03:43.319 --> 04:03:44.389 align:start position:0%
that complicated but I think it's
perhaps

04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:03:46.990 --> 04:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
time the time is right because now there
 
04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
is a consensus among all the
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that something needs to be
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
done so I just urge us after 30 years to
 
04:03:54.070 --> 04:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
get this
 
04:03:57.910 --> 04:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
done thank you thank you representative
 
04:04:00.910 --> 04:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
Weber so is getting it done in your
 
04:04:03.550 --> 04:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
opinion passing the bill as it is or is
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
getting it done changing the bill into a
 
04:04:06.000 --> 04:04:06.990 align:start position:0%
getting it done changing the bill into a
study

04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
committee I don't like the idea of study
 
04:04:11.469 --> 04:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
committee because I'd like it to be done
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
more quickly than that um so
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's suggestion
 
04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
that uh um a subcommittee could be
 
04:04:21.070 --> 04:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
formed might be helpful one of the
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
issues and I'm I'm not as conversing
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
with this topic as Sarah is but one of
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
the issues with just passing the bill as
 
04:04:31.070 --> 04:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
it is uh comes around hm
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
1201 which are the rules that apply to
 
04:04:35.710 --> 04:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
community residences and the question is
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
should those rules apply to Res
 
04:04:41.070 --> 04:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
Residential Care Homes are they wholly
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate to Residential Care Homes or
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
could something else perhaps less
 
04:04:47.950 --> 04:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
restrictive be done that's just one
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
question that would come to mind so I
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
think a little bit of
 
04:04:56.590 --> 04:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
study around that would be helpful but
 
04:04:58.990 --> 04:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to postpone things as
 
04:04:59.000 --> 04:04:59.830 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to postpone things as
long

04:04:59.830 --> 04:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
long
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
as as long as the calendar would
 
04:05:04.349 --> 04:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
indicate if we went with a study
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee other
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Doran

04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
Services you don't indicate an amount of
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
time how much time do you think you're
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
here three minutes
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay I always forget there we go
 
04:05:40.750 --> 04:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
now it's on um good afternoon um
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee members I am Dorian shakley I
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
am the manager of the Bureau of
 
04:05:46.510 --> 04:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
Licensing and certification at the
 
04:05:48.790 --> 04:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh I was not intending on speaking today
 
04:05:53.550 --> 04:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
um and I hope that I will be very brief
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
I wanted to clarify some items that have
 
04:05:59.309 --> 04:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
come up a few times um we the department
 
04:06:01.349 --> 04:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
um the Bure or I'm sorry part of the
 
04:06:03.189 --> 04:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Licensing and certification is
 
04:06:05.710 --> 04:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
our adult licensing unit Kelly Keefe is
 
04:06:08.590 --> 04:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
the unit chief of that unit has been
 
04:06:10.990 --> 04:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
actively involved with Sarah and her
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues in terms of changing the
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
rules and we have worked very closely
 
04:06:17.790 --> 04:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors on this bill we have
 
04:06:20.429 --> 04:06:20.439 align:start position:0%
also met regularly with um the EMB
 
04:06:23.870 --> 04:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
budsman office who's here we've met with
 
04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
the oplc the Board of Nursing has been
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
invited to these sessions um we all
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
agree that this is a very important
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
topic and things need to happen however
 
04:06:38.030 --> 04:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written now doesn't
 
04:06:40.870 --> 04:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
completely solve the issue and as we
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
were going oh um as we were going
 
04:06:46.349 --> 04:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
through a lot of the meetings uh
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is also present
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
and one of her AIDS was going to do some
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
research to determine the history on why
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
um the community-based services are
 
04:06:58.990 --> 04:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
exempt from and um representative wber
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
you've brought this up a few times and I
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify the difference
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's a very distinct difference
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
between community- Based Services and
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
our licensed residential facilities uh
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
Community Based Services are certified
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
through um a community residence unit
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
that I also oversee and there are no
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
more than four individuals living in a
 
04:07:20.710 --> 04:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
home I could be one of those providers
 
04:07:23.070 --> 04:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
you could be one of those providers um
 
04:07:26.189 --> 04:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
so then when you get into a residential
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
setting you have um usually more than 16
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
individuals there are also as we were
 
04:07:34.109 --> 04:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
progressing through this conversation
 
04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
there's layers and layers there's life
 
04:07:38.269 --> 04:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
safety there's fire code um so there's
 
04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
all it it involves many different
 
04:07:42.790 --> 04:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
agencies and many different stakeholders
 
04:07:45.109 --> 04:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
so we thought that the the important
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
thing to do was to pause and to figure
 
04:07:50.189 --> 04:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
out what is the best way to all gather
 
04:07:51.790 --> 04:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
together to make sure that we come up
 
04:07:54.990 --> 04:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
with a bill that covers all of it and
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
keeps the people and the residents that
 
04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
are in these facilities safe not all
 
04:08:05.189 --> 04:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
facilities are going to do as Sarah has
 
04:08:07.710 --> 04:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
been well at explaining so we need to be
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
very careful that the training that
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
these individuals are going to have
 
04:08:14.910 --> 04:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
meets a certain threshold so um again we
 
04:08:17.550 --> 04:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
all agree that something needs to happen
 
04:08:20.189 --> 04:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
but going to study whatever that is
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
called commission committee I've heard a
 
04:08:23.790 --> 04:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
lot of language and I'm sorry I'm not as
 
04:08:25.870 --> 04:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with that as I should
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
be any representative Shapiro thank you
 
04:08:33.630 --> 04:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I heard you say that um
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
you don't think that this language
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
solves the problem um
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
um and it's and and I also heard you say
 
04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
that we all have to get together to
 
04:08:45.229 --> 04:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
solve this problem but it seems like
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're in a unique position um and I
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could come up with
 
04:08:53.070 --> 04:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
language to solve the problem so um I
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
would love to be part of the committee
 
04:08:56.710 --> 04:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
that um representative Merchant is going
 
04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
to oversee um so and again we have um we
 
04:09:03.790 --> 04:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
have a lot of interest already within
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
the State Department of Health and Human
 
04:09:08.109 --> 04:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
Services so I know we are all committed
 
04:09:10.750 --> 04:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
to doing this so and I agree with Gary I
 
04:09:12.750 --> 04:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
mean the sooner the better um but it
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be thoughtful and intentional
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and solve all of the issues and make
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
sure that we've taken everything into
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
consideration because at the end of the
 
04:09:22.630 --> 04:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
day we want all of our residents to be
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
safe follow up followup thank you um my
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
my experience working currently on a few
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
other bills that we're trying to get
 
04:09:34.229 --> 04:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
agreement among people is that um even
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
where there's not that much disagreement
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
um is it's difficult and sometimes if
 
04:09:38.680 --> 04:09:40.710 align:start position:0%
um is it's difficult and sometimes if
there's

04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
um if there's a starting point which you
 
04:09:49.469 --> 04:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
may be uniquely positioned to um have um
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:59.149 --> 04:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know what my question is
 
04:10:03.070 --> 04:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
except that um I I guess my question is
 
04:10:05.710 --> 04:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
are you confident that the this group of
 
04:10:08.830 --> 04:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
people meeting together for
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
a short amount of time could come up
 
04:10:14.109 --> 04:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
with the solution absolutely okay thank
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:10:16.439 --> 04:10:18.550 align:start position:0%
you representative
Weber

04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
04:10:22.630 --> 04:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
so in generating a
 
04:10:22.640 --> 04:10:24.149 align:start position:0%
so in generating a
solution

04:10:24.149 --> 04:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
solution
 
04:10:26.189 --> 04:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
um would
 
04:10:29.710 --> 04:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
you care to comment on my bewilderment
 
04:10:33.109 --> 04:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
here because when this was when this
 
04:10:36.149 --> 04:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
issue came to me and I'm one of the
 
04:10:40.510 --> 04:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors it was from my County Nursing
 
04:10:40.520 --> 04:10:41.590 align:start position:0%
sponsors it was from my County Nursing
Home

04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
Home
 
04:10:44.149 --> 04:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
administrator who was very concerned
 
04:10:46.950 --> 04:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
about staffing issues as everybody else
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
is and medication administration in the
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
context of our County nursing home and
 
04:10:57.950 --> 04:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
now as far as I can tell the discussion
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't include County nursing homes at
 
04:11:01.439 --> 04:11:04.030 align:start position:0%
doesn't include County nursing homes at
all

04:11:04.030 --> 04:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
and while I wonder how we got from to
 
04:11:08.279 --> 04:11:11.910 align:start position:0%
and while I wonder how we got from to
hear

04:11:11.910 --> 04:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm still left with that question
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
that I've asked everybody else if this
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
is done in a facility that has more
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
supervision rather than less supervision
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
because the initial concept had to do
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
with County nursing
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
homes would that be a problem for the
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
department so I'm un aware of any County
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
nursing home that has had this challenge
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
or has brought this to so I'm happy to
 
04:11:45.469 --> 04:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
have any conversations with that
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
administrator or perhaps that
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
administrator or other representatives
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
from the County nursing homes should be
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
part of this study uh or commission
 
04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee whatever we're calling it I'm
 
04:11:59.469 --> 04:11:59.479 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand more supervision
 
04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
um when you have a community residence
 
04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
that has three maybe four residents that
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
are DD or developmentally disabled or AC
 
04:12:11.469 --> 04:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder I'm sorry I'm
 
04:12:12.670 --> 04:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
forgetting there's another side of the
 
04:12:14.750 --> 04:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
room here
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
um those folks have lower Acuity needs
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
than in general than um an assisted
 
04:12:24.990 --> 04:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
living facility and I think Sarah
 
04:12:27.149 --> 04:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
articulated that very well there's
 
04:12:29.309 --> 04:12:29.319 align:start position:0%
different levels two different levels of
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
an assisted living and then there's the
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
nursing homes which are which comprise
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
the bulk of our residential settings a
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
community residents doesn't fall under
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
that same definition they are carved out
 
04:12:44.910 --> 04:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
as as separate and distinct so they also
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
have Staffing but often times in a
 
04:12:49.229 --> 04:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
community resident the Staffing is one
 
04:12:51.670 --> 04:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
to one so the Staffing ratio in a
 
04:12:55.630 --> 04:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
community residence is often much higher
 
04:12:58.990 --> 04:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
than that in a assisted living facility
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about apples and
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
oranges um and I know that's it's really
 
04:13:06.030 --> 04:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's really complex and for that I'm
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
sorry um but and that's why I think to
 
04:13:13.670 --> 04:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's question um I
 
04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
think the folks that have already been
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
discussing this and we're so thankful to
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and and and the folks that
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
have brought this forward that they have
 
04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
engaged with us early on we've been
 
04:13:26.670 --> 04:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
talking about this for months and
 
04:13:30.030 --> 04:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
meeting on it very carefully you said
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
and I my answer was absolutely you said
 
04:13:33.790 --> 04:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
in a short period of time I should have
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
asked for you to Define
 
04:13:36.159 --> 04:13:37.990 align:start position:0%
asked for you to Define
that

04:13:37.990 --> 04:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:38.000 --> 04:13:40.510 align:start position:0%
that
representative

04:13:40.510 --> 04:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman I'm I'm
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
not sure it increases my confidence to
 
04:13:47.309 --> 04:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
know that you've been working on it for
 
04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
months um this is a question for the
 
04:13:53.590 --> 04:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
chair we've talked about varieties of
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
way to to study this or come to some
 
04:13:59.070 --> 04:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
kind of agreement would one way be for
 
04:14:02.590 --> 04:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
just the stakeholders involved and DHHS
 
04:14:05.309 --> 04:14:05.319 align:start position:0%
to continue working on a solution with
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
maybe one member of our committee
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
um sitting in with them would that be
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
not an official committee and could that
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
happen by zoom and could that be a more
 
04:14:18.030 --> 04:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
informal process since we have a number
 
04:14:20.910 --> 04:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
of weeks before we have to exact this
 
04:14:24.469 --> 04:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
bill um that's kind of a unique approach
 
04:14:27.389 --> 04:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
um representative Weber uh do you know
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
of that having been done
 
04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
or okay well as as let me first say as
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
as the short answer uh um we need to
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
report this out if we're going to report
 
04:14:44.229 --> 04:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
it out and not have an interim study or
 
04:14:46.030 --> 04:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
a study committee if we're going to have
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
an actual bill our last day to report
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
that is March 21st so that's a drop dead
 
04:14:54.750 --> 04:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
deadline and you could certainly pursue
 
04:14:57.790 --> 04:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
both options you know on the one hand
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can come to a resolution
 
04:15:02.109 --> 04:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
and on the other hand let's have a a
 
04:15:04.990 --> 04:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
study committee ready to go if we can't
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
but it has to get done by March 21st
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's item number one item number two
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
is that as long as it is not an official
 
04:15:16.990 --> 04:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
committee or a subcommittee of this
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
house everybody in the state of New
 
04:15:22.109 --> 04:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a right to consult with
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the state of New
 
04:15:28.229 --> 04:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as they please um and so any
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
group that wants to get together is is
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
welcome to do so and they're welcome to
 
04:15:35.950 --> 04:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
invite anybody they want to invite
 
04:15:37.469 --> 04:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
through whatever means they wish for
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
whatever means as long as we're not
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
violating the right to no law which
 
04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
would be mean a majority of this
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee which isn't a um a political
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
caucus so um you you can certainly have
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
meetings with okay less than a majority
 
04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
of this committee plus anybody else who
 
04:15:56.590 --> 04:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:00.389 --> 04:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
participate um but we need for
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislative purposes to have some kind
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
of action on the bill by March 21st
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
because that's the deadline for our um
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
committee to report and that's over a
 
04:16:15.309 --> 04:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
month and a half okay and so that's very
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you representative wber so
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
if I
 
04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
understand the the sponsor and and we've
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
been meeting for months but not like
 
04:16:26.389 --> 04:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
weekly or daily um not that we would
 
04:16:29.630 --> 04:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
meet daily but um we could in fact
 
04:16:33.630 --> 04:16:33.640 align:start position:0%
increase the frequency of our meetings I
 
04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
think and then if we were to come up
 
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
with with language that makes sense even
 
04:16:42.830 --> 04:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
shortterm and then longterm something
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
else as long as we as long as the
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor has something to you by the
 
04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
March 21st date then we'd want it before
 
04:16:53.790 --> 04:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
that we'd like it before that because
 
04:16:55.990 --> 04:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
yes bear bear in mind that we also if I
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
may Mr chair have to get it through OS
 
04:17:01.229 --> 04:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
which is legislative drafting we can't
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed as a committee to vote
 
04:17:04.870 --> 04:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
on something that looks like this we
 
04:17:07.469 --> 04:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
have to take it to legislative services
 
04:17:09.389 --> 04:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
and get them to draft and they are
 
04:17:13.269 --> 04:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
serving 424 of us it would be well was
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to be an kind of an informal
 
04:17:16.830 --> 04:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
effort it could be as simple as just
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
deferring any executive committee
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
executive session action until March
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we could do that certainly so um I
 
04:17:29.109 --> 04:17:29.119 align:start position:0%
clearly can't speak for the sponsor or
 
04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders but I I thank you
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
for this information I've never in all
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
the years I've been doing this had this
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
type of situation R so I appreciate the
 
04:17:40.349 --> 04:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
flexibility and the opportunity to
 
04:17:42.389 --> 04:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
continue working together to see if we
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
can come up with a combined solution
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
even if that's shortterm and long
 
04:17:50.349 --> 04:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
term representative Merchant thank you
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:17:54.429 --> 04:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
also I don't think we have to get it
 
04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
exactly correct um this is going to go
 
04:18:00.750 --> 04:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
to the other chamber so if we're close
 
04:18:03.070 --> 04:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
we can then continue the process or the
 
04:18:04.590 --> 04:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
chamber on the other side could continue
 
04:18:06.309 --> 04:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
the process to find tuna to make it
 
04:18:09.269 --> 04:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
exactly what people want so wanted to
 
04:18:11.229 --> 04:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
let people know that we don't we do have
 
04:18:13.990 --> 04:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
more than March 21st for the house but
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
we still have time on the other side of
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
the wall perfect thank
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative Kofa
 
04:18:25.469 --> 04:18:25.479 align:start position:0%
might I suggest that we U specify when
 
04:18:26.910 --> 04:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
when we would need it because right now
 
04:18:29.229 --> 04:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
we know that it's sometime before March
 
04:18:32.950 --> 04:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
21st but if we allow time for redrafting
 
04:18:35.469 --> 04:18:35.479 align:start position:0%
and for additional hearing discussion
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
and exact um what what date would we
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
like for there to be a proposal of some
 
04:18:49.349 --> 04:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
hand yeah the week of the 5th or the
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
week of the 12th of
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
March and again we usually been doing
 
04:18:56.429 --> 04:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
this on
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays so what the 7th or the well
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
14th is really pushing it those those
 
04:19:03.790 --> 04:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
are the wedes sorry those are the
 
04:19:06.109 --> 04:19:06.119 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays the 6th or the 13th of March
 
04:19:07.550 --> 04:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
would be a good
 
04:19:10.229 --> 04:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
date six let's aim for the sixth on all
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
of these six
 
04:19:15.109 --> 04:19:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay okay so March six sharpens the mind
 
04:19:17.910 --> 04:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
to have a deadline have a work
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
session so just to be clear we're we're
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
proposing that anybody who wants to
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
bring a proposed amendment would have
 
04:19:29.830 --> 04:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
the parameters for that proposed
 
04:19:31.630 --> 04:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
amendment by the six so that it could
 
04:19:36.750 --> 04:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
then be sent to OS and we could discuss
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
sit here you know have a hearing in
 
04:19:40.510 --> 04:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
exact session on the
 
04:19:43.030 --> 04:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
13th the sixth right didn't we say the
 
04:19:45.990 --> 04:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
sixth yeah so the thought would be
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
there's probably going to be several
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
bills some that we have subcommittees
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
some that we just informally have people
 
04:19:52.469 --> 04:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
working on and it would be good to
 
04:19:54.750 --> 04:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
ideally shoot proba for the sixth if we
 
04:19:56.750 --> 04:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
can for any of these so we can discuss
 
04:19:58.229 --> 04:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
them and see if there's further work
 
04:20:01.109 --> 04:20:01.119 align:start position:0%
that for hearing an exact for for a work
 
04:20:03.109 --> 04:20:03.119 align:start position:0%
session potentially yeah I think we
 
04:20:04.830 --> 04:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
would have to notice them for a work
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
session on the sixth and that gives us
 
04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to discuss among ourselves
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
which direction we're going in as a
 
04:20:11.790 --> 04:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
committee okay and and I guess I'm
 
04:20:13.750 --> 04:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we back it out a couple
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
of days for OLS to to draft something so
 
04:20:17.710 --> 04:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
04:20:21.109 --> 04:20:21.119 align:start position:0%
something clear to look at so I I'm just
 
04:20:23.469 --> 04:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
I I guess if I if I walk it backwards
 
04:20:25.469 --> 04:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at Friday the 1 of March as
 
04:20:29.229 --> 04:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
a well Poss representative
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
Weber I thought that the point of the
 
04:20:34.030 --> 04:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
sixth was you could discuss it on the
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
6th and then send anything to O l s
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
which would give us drafts for the 13th
 
04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
which would keep us well within our
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
within our time frames exact and give
 
04:20:48.269 --> 04:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
you the maximum amount of time to get
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
get it done and that's why I was
 
04:20:53.469 --> 04:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we notice the sixth as a
 
04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
work session so we can take it up and
 
04:20:58.750 --> 04:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
and either put it down or or just send
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
week representative mlan so that mean
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
DHHS and Arch they go off they meet and
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.309 --> 04:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak on this bill
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.439 --> 04:21:39.550 align:start position:0%
 
buckton

04:21:39.550 --> 04:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Susan buckon
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
I'm the state Long-Term Care edsman
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak I um
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
as Dorene said was not prepared to to
 
04:21:53.109 --> 04:21:53.119 align:start position:0%
speak today but um it sounds like given
 
04:21:55.790 --> 04:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
this last comment I would agree with
 
04:22:00.030 --> 04:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
that plan um as Dorene had had talked
 
04:22:03.030 --> 04:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
about I also served on some of the
 
04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
meetings and I believe at the end of the
 
04:22:08.510 --> 04:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
time which you know was just a couple of
 
04:22:10.510 --> 04:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
weeks ago we really had identified there
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
were a couple of things in this bill
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
that created some problems one of them
 
04:22:18.510 --> 04:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
was the reference to RSA 151 which
 
04:22:20.910 --> 04:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
includes nursing homes and there would
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
be conflict created if this bill were to
 
04:22:27.790 --> 04:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
pass as written um with the regulations
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
that are that oversee that are oversee
 
04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes um and so we need to
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
really be clear about which level of
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
care we're talking about I think the
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
other concern is we really need to fold
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the Board of Nursing and not create a
 
04:22:47.109 --> 04:22:47.119 align:start position:0%
whole separate system of individuals
 
04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
that are providing service in long-term
 
04:22:52.510 --> 04:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
care and before um one of the other
 
04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
committees in the house is the the um
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
question of
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
certification versus um registration of
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
nursing assistance um and I think there
 
04:23:06.510 --> 04:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
is a uh a plan to continue to work work
 
04:23:09.149 --> 04:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
on that and I think these two bills do
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
dovetail because we're now talking about
 
04:23:15.269 --> 04:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
creating a whole separate subset of
 
04:23:16.990 --> 04:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that are going to work in
 
04:23:17.000 --> 04:23:18.149 align:start position:0%
individuals that are going to work in
long-term

04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
care and um within the Residential Care
 
04:23:25.229 --> 04:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
setting and I I'm sorry I missed um some
 
04:23:27.630 --> 04:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
of the early test earlier testimony and
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
I know that um Sarah probably spoke to
 
04:23:32.670 --> 04:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
the difference between the 804 and the
 
04:23:36.309 --> 04:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
805 facility but even within those fac
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
facilities there's a tremendous amount
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
of variation between the types of
 
04:23:44.830 --> 04:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
service and the types of individuals and
 
04:23:47.349 --> 04:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
the complexity of their medical
 
04:23:49.149 --> 04:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
conditions that live within those
 
04:23:51.389 --> 04:23:51.399 align:start position:0%
buildings and I just want to make sure
 
04:23:53.910 --> 04:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
that we are really thoughtful that we're
 
04:23:58.149 --> 04:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
creating a set of laws that takes into
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
account all the different um types of
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
settings in which this
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
would this would cover and that we're
 
04:24:10.750 --> 04:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
we're really thoughtful that we're not
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
creating a situation which is unsafe for
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
the individuals that live in those
 
04:24:19.510 --> 04:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
buildings I'm happy to answer any
 
04:24:21.990 --> 04:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
04:24:25.109 --> 04:24:25.119 align:start position:0%
clarify okay representative Lon U thank

04:24:37.510 --> 04:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
rules I think it's both okay um then as
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
a followup if it's possible to get
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
information to us what what laws um and
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
which specific St sections of the
 
04:24:44.790 --> 04:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
statute would be in conflict that would
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
help us with the work okay thank you
 
04:24:47.680 --> 04:24:49.229 align:start position:0%
help us with the work okay thank you

questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:24:56.830 --> 04:24:56.840 align:start position:0%

when person signed up just to provide
 
04:25:10.109 --> 04:25:10.119 align:start position:0%

04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman good
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon I think it's been 22 years
 
04:25:47.389 --> 04:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
since I've been in front of the HHS
 
04:25:48.790 --> 04:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
committee and the last time was for an
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
ambulance bill also some of you might
 
04:25:54.950 --> 04:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
remember uh EMS was in 151b a long time
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
ago until we put it in 153a and I think
 
04:26:00.309 --> 04:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
that's the last time I was here believe
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
it or not so this
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
bill excuse me this bill is meant to
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
help our ambulance providers recoup
 
04:26:13.389 --> 04:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
their costs when they go to a call and
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
provide treatment and use resources and
 
04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
don't have any way to submit for payment
 
04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
unless they transport the patient so the
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
best example I can give you and the most
 
04:26:27.309 --> 04:26:27.319 align:start position:0%
common one and I suspect you might even
 
04:26:30.670 --> 04:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
hear it again from those behind us is um
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
in my 33 years as a
 
04:26:36.670 --> 04:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
paramedic um the typical
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
situation is a diabetic an unconscious
 
04:26:43.109 --> 04:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
unresponsive hypoglycemic diabetic um
 
04:26:46.349 --> 04:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
it's marginally routine for that disease
 
04:26:50.349 --> 04:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
state for in some cases that you find a
 
04:26:52.269 --> 04:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
diabetic who's just for some reason
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
their sugars gotten out of whack they
 
04:26:54.910 --> 04:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
didn't eat they exercise too much
 
04:26:57.309 --> 04:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and their loved ones or
 
04:27:00.670 --> 04:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
even they call uh and you check their
 
04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
sugar start an IV provide some uh
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
intervenous glucose oxygen and uh ECG
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
which are part of the standard of care
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:27:12.750 --> 04:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
workup and they wake up and they're fine
 
04:27:14.469 --> 04:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
they're good as new probably everybody
 
04:27:16.750 --> 04:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
here knows somebody like that and the
 
04:27:18.670 --> 04:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
last thing they really want to do is be
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
loaded into the back of the ambulance
 
04:27:22.630 --> 04:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
and taken to the ER the last thing the
 
04:27:24.149 --> 04:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
healthc care system wants to do is pay
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
for those two things uh especially the
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
second part which is the Ed visit which
 
04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
will which will result in typically labs
 
04:27:36.109 --> 04:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
and other sorts of things um so other
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
thirdparty payers do compensate for this
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
and you can imagine why they might
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
because they also would like to avoid
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
that expensive VR visit um so this bill
 
04:27:48.149 --> 04:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
was a request of a constituent of the
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor uh representative Sellers
 
04:27:52.750 --> 04:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
and I can I can tell you that it's a
 
04:27:56.109 --> 04:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
great idea it's a simple simple fix I
 
04:27:59.469 --> 04:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
have just learned today that uh our
 
04:28:02.389 --> 04:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
former division Chief or bureau chief I
 
04:28:03.790 --> 04:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
forget her exact maybe it was division
 
04:28:06.830 --> 04:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
director Senator Apprentice she was a
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
chief of VMS as many of you know uh has
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
another bill Senate Bill 409 which
 
04:28:14.750 --> 04:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
probably should be aligned with this
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
bill there's some language in that bill
 
04:28:20.550 --> 04:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
that um qualify how the services were
 
04:28:22.389 --> 04:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
accessed like through the 911 system
 
04:28:25.109 --> 04:28:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's a few good pieces of that bill so
 
04:28:26.910 --> 04:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
probably both of these should go
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
together and I think um there's probably
 
04:28:32.750 --> 04:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 or 14 Senators co-sponsoring
 
04:28:35.229 --> 04:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
that other bill so it might be nice if
 
04:28:38.429 --> 04:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
these two age agreed um when we when we
 
04:28:40.630 --> 04:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
get it so I'm sorry I literally just
 
04:28:42.109 --> 04:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
learned of it a short time ago so I
 
04:28:43.950 --> 04:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a proposed amendment for the
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
committee I would I would have done that
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
work for you and I'm happy to do that
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
work for you um but in summary it's you
 
04:28:51.149 --> 04:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
know hundreds of dollars thousands of
 
04:28:53.710 --> 04:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
dollars at the ER that could be easily
 
04:28:55.469 --> 04:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
saved and it's much better for the
 
04:28:57.389 --> 04:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
patient if they are able to just stay
 
04:29:00.630 --> 04:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
home uh and the providers are
 
04:29:04.229 --> 04:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
functioning at their level of Lure by
 
04:29:06.309 --> 04:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
allowing that to happen by
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh allowing them to sign a refusal of
 
04:29:11.229 --> 04:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
transport and I can talk to the fiscal
 
04:29:13.429 --> 04:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
note too uh which actually just came out
 
04:29:15.149 --> 04:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
today let me talk to the fiscal note
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
real quick because maybe that'll answer
 
04:29:18.750 --> 04:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
some other questions um the fiscal note
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
came out today and talks about um
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
significant additional expenditure in
 
04:29:26.349 --> 04:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
ambulance reimbursement that's probably
 
04:29:29.070 --> 04:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
likely uh but it would be more than
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
offset by the savings uh of what is
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
often the current practice which is put
 
04:29:35.670 --> 04:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
the patient in the ambulance before
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
before you do the workup now they're
 
04:29:39.710 --> 04:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
still unconscious or semiconscious and
 
04:29:41.349 --> 04:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
they you've got their implied consent to
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
transport them and therefore you can
 
04:29:45.750 --> 04:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
generate a bill right and and that is
 
04:29:47.469 --> 04:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
specifically the message that was told
 
04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
to us and I say us myself and my
 
04:29:51.149 --> 04:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
colleagues working for a private
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service once the hospitals
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
stopped replacing our consumables our IV
 
04:29:57.750 --> 04:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
setups and our drugs and all that for
 
04:29:59.870 --> 04:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
free and it started coming out of the
 
04:30:02.070 --> 04:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
private ambulance's pocket guess what
 
04:30:04.429 --> 04:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
happened we transported every patient
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
right because that's ailable run so we
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
were for essentially forced to do that
 
04:30:11.469 --> 04:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
to get some reimbursement uh and those
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
workups would happen in the back of the
 
04:30:14.109 --> 04:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
ambulance instead of in the patient's
 
04:30:16.229 --> 04:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
living room so ask yourself which is
 
04:30:18.429 --> 04:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
better I think we all know the answer so
 
04:30:20.429 --> 04:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully that if you look at the fiscal
 
04:30:23.710 --> 04:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
note it's it doesn't uh account for the
 
04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
offset the savings offset for ambulance
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
or ER visits that typically would
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
accompany uh this type of patient
 
04:30:34.349 --> 04:30:34.359 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King are you all set
 
04:30:36.510 --> 04:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question so essentially all
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we are looking at
 
04:30:49.189 --> 04:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
Shifting the costs which are now borne
 
04:30:51.790 --> 04:30:51.800 align:start position:0%
by I'm not I don't I'm not aware with
 
04:30:53.950 --> 04:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
the private ambulances but I certainly
 
04:30:56.910 --> 04:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
am aware about the town ambulances the
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
costs are currently shouldered by the
 
04:31:02.229 --> 04:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
town entirely because it's the ambulance
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
service and what this would do would be
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
to Avail ourselves of federal
 
04:31:11.670 --> 04:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
remuneration at least to some degree so
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:31:15.630 --> 04:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
offset both the charges on the town and
 
04:31:17.790 --> 04:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
the resultant property taxes is that
 
04:31:19.590 --> 04:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
right yeah that is my understanding and
 
04:31:21.109 --> 04:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
so every town does it a little bit
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
differently some towns don't bill at all
 
04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh for ambulance services to their their
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
Town's people you know it's sort of part
 
04:31:31.109 --> 04:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
of their services they provide uh in
 
04:31:35.189 --> 04:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
their taxes um some Bill only if the
 
04:31:37.950 --> 04:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
patient has Insurance some other some
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
some some paay could be Medicare
 
04:31:43.710 --> 04:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or or private insurance um so
 
04:31:45.109 --> 04:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
some don't build at all some build only
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
with insurance um but definitely this
 
04:31:51.910 --> 04:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
would help those towns that are
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise just bearing the cost of those
 
04:31:57.990 --> 04:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
non-transport treatment sessions and
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
it's not just for diabetics there's
 
04:32:03.630 --> 04:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
other other other possibilities
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
too so yeah I believe correct thank you
 
04:32:10.030 --> 04:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
for the question other questions
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative kushman thank you Mr
 
04:32:13.790 --> 04:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for bringing this
 
04:32:17.870 --> 04:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill and taking my question um I am
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
wondering about and I know we've touched
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
on it a little bit do you have any idea
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
what the cost increase is going to be to
 
04:32:28.189 --> 04:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
towns and companies to have Personnel
 
04:32:31.469 --> 04:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
qualified to submit the insurance
 
04:32:35.070 --> 04:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
claims um um repr of kushman that's a
 
04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
great question question and the answer
 
04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
is no I don't really know um but I do
 
04:32:43.830 --> 04:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
know that virtually every town
 
04:32:46.389 --> 04:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
bills in some fashion they already
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
they're already set up to submit an
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
invoice when there's a payment
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
Source not too many towns don't bill at
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
all like just ignore that part you know
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
they file the run sheet and then just
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
don't send anybody a bill um so I
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
suppose that the towns could choose to
 
04:33:06.510 --> 04:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
continue to not submit a
 
04:33:08.670 --> 04:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
bill I mean that's that's their current
 
04:33:11.070 --> 04:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
practice it's already borne by their
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
their tax base and they might choose to
 
04:33:15.670 --> 04:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
not take advantage of this source of
 
04:33:18.429 --> 04:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
reimbursement followup thank you um in
 
04:33:22.510 --> 04:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
my town we will send a bill
 
04:33:25.390 --> 04:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
um but it's just an invoice and then
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
it's the responsibility of the person if
 
04:33:29.070 --> 04:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
they have insurance to then send that to
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
their insurance um but we also have um a
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
policy that if the the need for services
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
was a result of um some negligence or
 
04:33:43.230 --> 04:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
the person was under the influence um
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
and they denied transport that we send
 
04:33:48.510 --> 04:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
them a bill for that as well um is there
 
04:33:50.789 --> 04:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
anything in here to kind of set that
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
kind of situation
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
aside um and exempt it from this
 
04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
coverage no uh not in this bill in 49 it
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
might be and I'm not sure I'd have to
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
pull up the text of 409 it's a bit it's
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
a bit longer but I I don't think there
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
isn't either and I I think the uh
 
04:34:11.830 --> 04:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
Department's attorney is behind me and
 
04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
he can probably answer that question
 
04:34:14.629 --> 04:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
he's much more familiar with that
 
04:34:14.639 --> 04:34:16.910 align:start position:0%
he's much more familiar with that
particular

04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:34:19.629 --> 04:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
Bill other questions representative
 
04:34:22.349 --> 04:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
Weber so this is a question of the chair
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of procedure given that there
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
is another bill in the Senate would it
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
not be simpler for us to pass the
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
legislation that we think we ought to
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
pass send it to the Senate and then let
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate change our legislation into
 
04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
their legislation and then it all comes
 
04:34:42.269 --> 04:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
out in the wash at the end rather than
 
04:34:45.510 --> 04:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh trying to justify them back and forth
 
04:34:48.310 --> 04:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
certainly it's a worthy objective I'm
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
not sure how the the sense of the
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
committee is but would make sense yeah
 
04:34:53.590 --> 04:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I just was trying to make it
 
04:34:56.670 --> 04:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
simpler on us sure
 
04:34:56.680 --> 04:34:58.349 align:start position:0%
simpler on us sure
sure

04:34:58.349 --> 04:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
yeah other
 
04:35:02.109 --> 04:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative Merchant did
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up a moment
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
ago more of inquiry um thank you Mr
 
04:35:10.990 --> 04:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
04:35:14.590 --> 04:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
question in the community that I reside
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
there's a frequent number of um 911
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
responses and a lot of it is sort of
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
what I call false
 
04:35:25.349 --> 04:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
responses and what triggers it is many
 
04:35:27.150 --> 04:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the elderly
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
have um devices and actually have things
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
on your Apple watch now if you fall and
 
04:35:34.470 --> 04:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
so forth and it triggers a response but
 
04:35:35.470 --> 04:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
there really is no matter medical
 
04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
emergency to it so how do we break that
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
apart from somebody who's truly like a
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
diabetic and needs a medical response
 
04:35:44.070 --> 04:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't something triggered by
 
04:35:45.551 --> 04:35:45.561 align:start position:0%
technology triggered by something that
 
04:35:47.470 --> 04:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
was sort of what I call a false alarm
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah great great question thank you
 
04:35:50.590 --> 04:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant for that uh and
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
it's it's a valid point we should bring
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
that up because there are a lot of those
 
04:35:55.709 --> 04:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
life call responses my own parents and
 
04:35:57.990 --> 04:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
others have been through that uh that
 
04:36:01.070 --> 04:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
generally doesn't generate treatment or
 
04:36:01.080 --> 04:36:02.269 align:start position:0%
generally doesn't generate treatment or
a

04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:36:05.949 --> 04:36:05.959 align:start position:0%
billable case a billable uh patient care
 
04:36:10.990 --> 04:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
record so you know just a lift assist
 
04:36:13.269 --> 04:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
back in you know off the floor to the
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
couch and they're fine there's no workup
 
04:36:18.390 --> 04:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
there there's no you know nobody
 
04:36:20.269 --> 04:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
starting an IV or giving oxygen or
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
anything like that um so that that
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
typically wouldn't generate a bill on
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
its own it's usually just a public
 
04:36:32.789 --> 04:36:32.799 align:start position:0%
service thank you other
 
04:36:49.789 --> 04:36:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:51.949 --> 04:36:51.959 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak a Rob Barry and
 
04:36:53.629 --> 04:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
David shney from the Department of
 
04:37:00.150 --> 04:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
Services good afternoon uh Mr chair
 
04:37:03.709 --> 04:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:37:05.310 --> 04:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
robberry I'm general counsel to the
 
04:37:06.310 --> 04:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid for the New
 
04:37:07.230 --> 04:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health need
 
04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
services and with me is good afternoon
 
04:37:12.551 --> 04:37:12.561 align:start position:0%
uh David chy Deputy Medicaid
 
04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
director uh so we uh are supportive of
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
uh this bill um we um we've provided
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
similar testimony at s sp49 which was
 
04:37:23.150 --> 04:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier uh we were going to
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
suggest that the two bills do align as
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
sp sp 409 does have some parameters in
 
04:37:32.109 --> 04:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
there that we think is helpful for uh uh
 
04:37:33.510 --> 04:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
to for the Department in terms of
 
04:37:35.869 --> 04:37:35.879 align:start position:0%
determining uh how a service would be
 
04:37:38.590 --> 04:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursable uh also uh there was some
 
04:37:41.070 --> 04:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
contingency language in s409 I believe
 
04:37:42.670 --> 04:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
that was just added this morning through
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
an executive session uh that would make
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
the bill contingent upon approval from
 
04:37:51.429 --> 04:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
CMS um so other than that uh I'm happy
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
to take any questions you may have thank
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%

04:40:40.830 --> 04:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
of background on what Midwifery is um
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
the practice of Midwifery under uh the
 
04:40:45.910 --> 04:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
statute that we have that governs it
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:07.788 --> 04:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
control of our handouts but we have
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
these have stopped there's another one
 
04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
here are there more of
 
04:41:17.830 --> 04:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
these div I didn't divide them no okay
 
04:41:19.868 --> 04:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
but I don't have any and the clerk
 
04:41:23.230 --> 04:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any oh did they stop at my
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
seat okay I didn't get the second
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
one I've oh you that one I apologize I
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:46.270 --> 04:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
but I don't have that one I think that
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:06.110 align:start position:0%
 
one

04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
everyone all set now okay thank you
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
sorry no worries
 
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
continue um
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
so under their scope of care this this
 
04:42:18.830 --> 04:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
statute it's um the administrative rules
 
04:42:21.510 --> 04:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
that govern Midwifery are created by a
 
04:42:25.150 --> 04:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
Midwifery Council um which is made up of
 
04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
three uh New Hampshire midwives and an
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
OBGYN and a physician I believe um and
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
it acts just like the Board of Nursing
 
04:42:36.830 --> 04:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
or the other boards where they they vote
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
on their rules um and so under their
 
04:42:44.190 --> 04:42:44.200 align:start position:0%

04:43:32.590 --> 04:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
resuscitation so I just giving you a
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
global kind of overview of what midwives
 
04:43:36.590 --> 04:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
are now there are certified nurse
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
midwives who are advanced practice
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
registered nurses um as far as I can
 
04:43:43.150 --> 04:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
tell these rules do not cover them
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
there's also Physicians assistants who
 
04:43:46.750 --> 04:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
can help with birth and they may have
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
some certifications in that area as
 
04:43:52.270 --> 04:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
well um and then we have your OBGYN
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
which is a different scope of practice
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
so the council handles the
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
certifications complaints regarding
 
04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
licenses scope practice continuing
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
education and the like um there are a
 
04:44:05.110 --> 04:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
small number of midwives in New
 
04:44:07.230 --> 04:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but is a growing industry um
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
as demand
 
04:44:11.470 --> 04:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
increases um so there are some things
 
04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
that the rule that the rules um in mid
 
04:44:18.750 --> 04:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
500 specifically require um that a
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
Midwifery terminate um the care
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
relationship with the mom for uh it's
 
04:44:28.990 --> 04:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
there to to protect the mom's um safety
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
and and a lot of it is um you know based
 
04:44:36.310 --> 04:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
on a study study well I'll get to that
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
sorry um it seems like there's a
 
04:44:40.708 --> 04:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
difficult process to have an amendment
 
04:44:43.150 --> 04:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
made to those rules you can petition a
 
04:44:44.910 --> 04:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
rule change in writing and satisfy
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
written explanations of um what I think
 
04:44:51.270 --> 04:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
it call what what um what it calls for
 
04:44:52.590 --> 04:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
and then they send you a decision and an
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
explanation but I don't think that the
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
majority of patients um mothers who are
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
pregnant know how to go about asking for
 
04:45:01.750 --> 04:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
these changes and I happen to be plugged
 
04:45:04.390 --> 04:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
into um communities where a lot of these
 
04:45:06.868 --> 04:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
moms who um would rather have a home
 
04:45:10.190 --> 04:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
birth are and I hear from them all the
 
04:45:13.310 --> 04:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
time um their complaints about their
 
04:45:15.990 --> 04:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
access to Midwifery care um so that's
 
04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
why I brought this bill forward as a
 
04:45:19.470 --> 04:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative I'm bringing on behalf of
 
04:45:19.480 --> 04:45:20.190 align:start position:0%
representative I'm bringing on behalf of
the

04:45:20.190 --> 04:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
people um Midwifery is not a novel
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
practice and uh the per purpose
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
statement of RSA 326d says um it it
 
04:45:32.590 --> 04:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
explains clearly that women are going to
 
04:45:34.990 --> 04:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
choose home birth and they're at
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
increasing rates and if they're going to
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
we should allow them to have help
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
available many women right now are
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
precluded from Midwifery care for the
 
04:45:47.948 --> 04:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
reasons listed in the bill um which I
 
04:45:52.868 --> 04:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
will expound on um and they would rather
 
04:45:56.948 --> 04:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
give birth beside a river alone than go
 
04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
to a hospital and receive Care at a
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
hospital and so if we're concerned about
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
safe of women and infants in home birth
 
04:46:11.070 --> 04:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
um that's something that's a question
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
that we need to ask ourselves um is it
 
04:46:16.830 --> 04:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
safer to deliver at home with a midwife
 
04:46:19.750 --> 04:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
in a potentially higher risk higher risk
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
situation or is it safer to birth
 
04:46:27.510 --> 04:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
alone um so the conditions that are
 
04:46:30.190 --> 04:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:35.590 --> 04:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill um the first one is multiples I'll
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
get to that later um I got questions
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
about you know the the statistics on the
 
04:46:44.470 --> 04:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
risks so we'll talk about vaginal births
 
04:46:44.480 --> 04:46:45.910 align:start position:0%
risks so we'll talk about vaginal births
after

04:46:45.910 --> 04:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
after
 
04:46:49.110 --> 04:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
cesarians right now you can have a
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
vbac um it's called colloquial
 
04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
colloquially a v-back um you can have
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
one have midwe recare after you've had
 
04:47:00.150 --> 04:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
one but you can't have midwar for your
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
care if you've had two so this build
 
04:47:04.948 --> 04:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
just brings it up to you can have one
 
04:47:08.110 --> 04:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
after two uh the Northern New England
 
04:47:11.070 --> 04:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
paranal quality improvement network uh
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
which provides a
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
document and guidelines for health
 
04:47:21.910 --> 04:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
workers um and and that document is used
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
to provide informed consent that's
 
04:47:23.760 --> 04:47:24.868 align:start position:0%
to provide informed consent that's
required

04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
by uh rules for midwives to do
 
04:47:34.750 --> 04:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
vacks they have in their guidelines
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
that the risk for uterine rupture is
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
approximately. 3 to
 
04:47:44.470 --> 04:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
7% in a person who has
 
04:47:48.110 --> 04:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
had um one v-back and then the risk for
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
a uterine rupture is likely greater than
 
04:47:57.470 --> 04:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
7% for two prior vacks so there is a
 
04:48:00.270 --> 04:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
risk there now how you would determine
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
that risk versus how someone else would
 
04:48:03.600 --> 04:48:04.708 align:start position:0%
that risk versus how someone else would
would

04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:48:08.230 --> 04:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
um would look at it can be
 
04:48:10.670 --> 04:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
different um but essentially there are
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
other things that come into play when
 
04:48:14.708 --> 04:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
we're talking about risk you know you
 
04:48:17.430 --> 04:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
could have a person who is completely
 
04:48:21.948 --> 04:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
healthy and has had um one cesarian
 
04:48:24.510 --> 04:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
section and has no other risk
 
04:48:26.670 --> 04:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
factors or you could have someone who
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
has had um has had two and no other risk
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
factors or you could have someone who's
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
never had a cesarian section but has a
 
04:48:34.708 --> 04:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
lot of other RIS risk factor so it's
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
like a matrix that you need to consider
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
um and that is something I think that
 
04:48:41.230 --> 04:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
Midwife should be able to
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
consider um I think that we talk a lot
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
about not regulating the practice of
 
04:48:52.750 --> 04:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
medicine um not you know not legislating
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:00.270 --> 04:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
seeing I'm seeing in these rules that
 
04:49:04.030 --> 04:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
there's no other practice that's more
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
regulated than Midwifery I mean I would
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
be terrified to work as a midwife in New
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it's the rules are so
 
04:49:17.150 --> 04:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
cumbersome I mean it's almost impossible
 
04:49:18.990 --> 04:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
with the standards of practice for you
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
to I mean the way I see them to follow
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
them completely um and there's nothing
 
04:49:25.948 --> 04:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
in there about you know patients being
 
04:49:28.350 --> 04:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
able to refuse certain things either so
 
04:49:30.548 --> 04:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
it assumes that patients will just do
 
04:49:33.030 --> 04:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
whatever you say um so that that's where
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
the liability comes in but so midwives
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
are are trained in birth work these are
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
CPM certified professional midwives they
 
04:49:46.310 --> 04:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
go to school uh a a accredited school
 
04:49:48.910 --> 04:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
then they have to have a preceptorship
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
they get experience they take courses on
 
04:49:51.958 --> 04:49:53.150 align:start position:0%
they get experience they take courses on
laceration

04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
laceration
 
04:49:55.310 --> 04:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
repair and
 
04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
many receive instruction and can even go
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
and be certified on breach delivery
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
malpresentation of the fetus that's what
 
04:50:04.670 --> 04:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
the next
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
um the next
 
04:50:10.750 --> 04:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
um disqualifier for Midwifery care is
 
04:50:12.270 --> 04:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
malpresentation so we know that is
 
04:50:15.470 --> 04:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
breach right um I did pass out a couple
 
04:50:18.270 --> 04:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
of handouts one is an article from
 
04:50:22.030 --> 04:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
2019 um it's in the Journal of midify
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
today it's a literature review um if you
 
04:50:29.628 --> 04:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
look on page
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
two um it's mentioning the rcog which is
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
Canada's version of the American college
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
for Obstetrics and
 
04:50:40.830 --> 04:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
Gynecology um and talking about how they
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
updated their breach guidelines in 2017
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
and estimated the risk of paranal
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
mortality during a planned vaginal
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
breach birth at around 1 out of 500
 
04:50:51.910 --> 04:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
compared to one out of a th000 for
 
04:50:55.708 --> 04:50:55.718 align:start position:0%
Planned birth and one out of 2,000
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
for a planned cesarian
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
section uh this number aligns with many
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
large National Registries and meta
 
04:51:04.350 --> 04:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
analyses however in France and Belgium
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
which have retained a strong tradition
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
of vaginal breach birth and continue to
 
04:51:09.788 --> 04:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
teach breach in residency programs large
 
04:51:11.230 --> 04:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
highquality perspective Studies have
 
04:51:13.110 --> 04:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
found no differences in neonatal
 
04:51:15.548 --> 04:51:15.558 align:start position:0%
outcomes and there's a lot of comparison
 
04:51:18.510 --> 04:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
of many studies in this article too so I
 
04:51:21.910 --> 04:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
encourage you to read the whole thing
 
04:51:25.150 --> 04:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
um so it used to be taught
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
routinely uh it's something that is
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
taught routinely
 
04:51:30.430 --> 04:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
elsewhere now it's no longer really
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
taught there was a study that came out I
 
04:51:35.190 --> 04:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
think it was 2003 it's called the breach
 
04:51:38.670 --> 04:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
um trial and it pretty much put a death
 
04:51:41.470 --> 04:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
Nowell in the idea of any planned
 
04:51:47.470 --> 04:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
vaginal breach births and since then uh
 
04:51:51.030 --> 04:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
most um most hospitals will not even
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
permit a woman to attempt a vaginal
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
delivery with a breach baby um mostly I
 
04:52:02.230 --> 04:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
think because nobody's trained in that
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
delivery um and also hospitals tend to
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
operate on a risk
 
04:52:10.430 --> 04:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
reduction um
 
04:52:13.390 --> 04:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
Paradigm so it used to be taught
 
04:52:15.628 --> 04:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
routinely we have fewer birth workers
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
who who do this but there seems to be a
 
04:52:20.190 --> 04:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
higher percentage of birth workers who
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
are certified in you know repositioning
 
04:52:27.910 --> 04:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
or delivering breach babies uh among
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
midwives so in New Hampshire the the
 
04:52:32.350 --> 04:52:32.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals won't attempt this the policy
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
is C-section is the only option so
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
what's a mom to do she's 37 weeks she's
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
been seeing a midwife the whole time her
 
04:52:42.548 --> 04:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
baby still
 
04:52:45.150 --> 04:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
breach and now she's really concerned
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
that she's going to have to just go to
 
04:52:48.990 --> 04:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
the hospital and have a
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
C-section ACOG and JC both give the
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
green light for vaginal breach births to
 
04:52:55.110 --> 04:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
be attempted in hospitals but their
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
recommendations are silent on vaginal
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
breach birth and home
 
04:53:01.868 --> 04:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
setting uh advances in labor and Risk
 
04:53:04.350 --> 04:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
Management International uh have
 
04:53:05.990 --> 04:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
selection criteria for Planned vaginal
 
04:53:08.670 --> 04:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
breach deliveries their key messages are
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
the decision is to perform the decision
 
04:53:11.440 --> 04:53:12.310 align:start position:0%
the decision is to perform the decision
to

04:53:12.310 --> 04:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
perform um involves providing informed
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
choice to the woman regarding risks
 
04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and healthc care provider
 
04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
competencies when a woman presents with
 
04:53:23.110 --> 04:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
a breach baby a vaginal delivery should
 
04:53:25.070 --> 04:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
be encouraged if she meets the criteria
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
and health providers should develop and
 
04:53:28.110 --> 04:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
maintain their skills in vaginal breach
 
04:53:30.910 --> 04:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
delivery The Who guide that you have in
 
04:53:33.150 --> 04:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
front of you also has a a guide for
 
04:53:33.160 --> 04:53:34.190 align:start position:0%
front of you also has a a guide for
breach

04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
breach
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
birth um which I passed out um multiples
 
04:53:40.230 --> 04:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's more of the same yes there there is
 
04:53:42.750 --> 04:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
an increased risk of complication but
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
healthy multiple deliveries do occur in
 
04:53:46.948 --> 04:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
homes across the United States all the
 
04:53:50.548 --> 04:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
time um in other states midwives deliver
 
04:53:53.430 --> 04:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
Twins and it's not precluded in their
 
04:53:55.470 --> 04:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
scope of
 
04:53:58.990 --> 04:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
practice um so this is really just about
 
04:54:02.190 --> 04:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
you know expanding what moms can access
 
04:54:04.708 --> 04:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
because right now it's either
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
go have a C-section or give birth alone
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
in your living room so um I appreciate
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
any discussion on this and thank you for
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
the time thank you any
 
04:54:20.910 --> 04:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Seth King thank
 
04:54:22.350 --> 04:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:54:24.670 --> 04:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
questions um I'm sorry if you already
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned this I missed it um it says
 
04:54:31.708 --> 04:54:31.718 align:start position:0%
here um or the patient having had fewer
 
04:54:34.030 --> 04:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
than three previous cesarian
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
sections um again sorry if you already
 
04:54:38.110 --> 04:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
talked about that but can you just
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
elaborate that that seems kind of weird
 
04:54:42.788 --> 04:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
that there would be a rule that would
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
say if you've had four or more cerian
 
04:54:46.948 --> 04:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
sections then it's okay for you to be a
 
04:54:48.868 --> 04:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
midwife but if you've had less than that
 
04:54:50.708 --> 04:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's not allowed I don't know I
 
04:54:52.628 --> 04:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
just don't get it thank you thank you
 
04:54:57.230 --> 04:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
for the question um so it's to allow up
 
04:55:00.788 --> 04:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
to two previous cesarian sections right
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
now you can only have midwe free care if
 
04:55:11.430 --> 04:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
one no rule shall be adopted requiring
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
denial of care for the patient having
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
sections if it's not clear we can make
 
04:55:28.548 --> 04:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
it clearer no problem I'll set
 
04:55:31.548 --> 04:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
representative mlan thank you Mr chair
 
04:55:33.390 --> 04:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
04:55:36.430 --> 04:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
do you have any data on uh the
 
04:55:40.230 --> 04:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
occurrence of Home births where the
 
04:55:43.510 --> 04:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
services of a midwife have been uh
 
04:55:46.350 --> 04:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
denied um I don't have statistics on you
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
know how often that occurs but there's
 
04:55:51.670 --> 04:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
many different reasons why um a midwife
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
would decide to transfer care and not
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
all of which is even covered in the
 
04:55:58.470 --> 04:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that are governing
 
04:56:02.430 --> 04:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
them now um but it it happens fairly
 
04:56:04.390 --> 04:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
often usually not not during the birth
 
04:56:07.110 --> 04:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
usually some risk factor is identified
 
04:56:10.510 --> 04:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
prior to even the end of gestation when
 
04:56:12.230 --> 04:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
the due date is arrived at and so
 
04:56:14.590 --> 04:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
they'll have to transfer care um even
 
04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
even being so in the rules there's a lot
 
04:56:20.270 --> 04:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
about you have to consult with an with a
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
MD or an specifically an obstetrician or
 
04:56:26.910 --> 04:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
a CNM certified nurse Midwife um
 
04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
regarding continuance of care for
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
certain things that pop
 
04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
up um which again I think it's I'm not a
 
04:56:37.030 --> 04:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
fan of those I feel that the Midwife
 
04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
should make that decision this is what
 
04:56:40.110 --> 04:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
they do this is where their training
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
comes from and they are not going to put
 
04:56:44.910 --> 04:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
a mom in Jeopardy um this isn't new
 
04:56:46.990 --> 04:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
ground that we're breaking this is an
 
04:56:47.000 --> 04:56:48.590 align:start position:0%
ground that we're breaking this is an
ancient

04:56:48.590 --> 04:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
ancient
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
traditional um position
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
but I
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
digress thank you representative
 
04:57:01.390 --> 04:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:07.548 --> 04:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
I always thought of pregnancy being some
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
of a high risk and it sort of alluded to
 
04:57:11.868 --> 04:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
that I think in the testimony where if
 
04:57:14.190 --> 04:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
you have one vaginal
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
delivery sorry one seat section delivery
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
and then you have follow with a vaginal
 
04:57:19.280 --> 04:57:21.030 align:start position:0%
and then you have follow with a vaginal
is

04:57:21.030 --> 04:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:57:23.548 --> 04:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
7% with complications but if you get to
 
04:57:26.910 --> 04:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
two it goes to 7% which is concerning do
 
04:57:29.230 --> 04:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
we have any stats from the office of
 
04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
profession professional license
 
04:57:33.270 --> 04:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
insurance certification regards to
 
04:57:35.670 --> 04:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
concerns and complaints filed against
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
midwives um and try to understand from
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
the public what has been voiced with
 
04:57:43.070 --> 04:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
concerns to the office of professional
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
license insur certification for
 
04:57:46.948 --> 04:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
investigations or to
 
04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
complaints thank you for the question I
 
04:57:51.430 --> 04:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
think that we could leave that for them
 
04:57:54.430 --> 04:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
to answer um I don't I don't know about
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
the complaint rats you had mentioned to
 
04:57:57.868 --> 04:57:57.878 align:start position:0%
me that you had heard that they were
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
higher among midwives I don't know why
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
that is thank you other question
 
04:58:06.590 --> 04:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative U Shapero thank you Mr
 
04:58:06.600 --> 04:58:08.990 align:start position:0%
representative U Shapero thank you Mr
chairman

04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
um you you refer to the education that
 
04:58:18.270 --> 04:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
um needed in order to be certified as a
 
04:58:21.628 --> 04:58:21.638 align:start position:0%
a certified midwife which is distinct
 
04:58:25.948 --> 04:58:25.958 align:start position:0%
from a a certified nurse Midwife correct
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
um could you um refer us to um something
 
04:58:32.230 --> 04:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
that would elaborate on what that
 
04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
education is is how long and what kind
 
04:58:34.878 --> 04:58:35.868 align:start position:0%
education is is how long and what kind
of

04:58:35.868 --> 04:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:58:41.708 --> 04:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:44.788 --> 04:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
up so the American College of nurse
 
04:58:48.430 --> 04:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
midwives certifies nurse midwives and
 
04:58:48.440 --> 04:58:49.868 align:start position:0%
midwives certifies nurse midwives and
certified

04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
certified
 
04:58:49.878 --> 04:58:51.628 align:start position:0%
certified
midwives

04:58:51.628 --> 04:58:51.638 align:start position:0%
midwives
 
04:58:51.638 --> 04:58:54.350 align:start position:0%
midwives
um

04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:01.270 --> 04:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:04.110 --> 04:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
the national nor American registry of
 
04:59:05.868 --> 04:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
midwives also
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
certifies um so you can I I can send you
 
04:59:11.788 --> 04:59:11.798 align:start position:0%
you know what what they do but it's a
 
04:59:14.830 --> 04:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's a full program um and then you do a
 
04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
preceptorship with a current Midwife
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
where you attend a certain number of
 
04:59:22.150 --> 04:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
deliveries and prenatal appointments and
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
you um get a certain amount of
 
04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
experience that is signed off on it's
 
04:59:32.590 --> 04:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
very extensive it's in mid um 300 I
 
04:59:34.830 --> 04:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
believe section of the rules if you want
 
04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
to look at them closely but they're I
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
mean it's not easy it's a very
 
04:59:42.030 --> 04:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
challenging process and I've never
 
04:59:43.788 --> 04:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
worked in Midwifery but I I've
 
04:59:46.948 --> 04:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
considered pursuing it um and going that
 
04:59:49.628 --> 04:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
route but I mean it is very cumbersome
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
of a of an education to consider
 
04:59:57.270 --> 04:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
pursuing follow follow up yes I I think
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you referred to the complication
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
rate with um
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
vaginal birth after
 
05:00:09.910 --> 05:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
um after a c-section but I don't know if
 
05:00:12.750 --> 05:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
you did the same with um breach births
 
05:00:15.070 --> 05:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
but do you know of any information that
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
might compare the complication rates or
 
05:00:20.230 --> 05:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
the outcomes
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
with vaginal breach births done at home
 
05:00:27.270 --> 05:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
versus done in a hospital
 
05:00:30.788 --> 05:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
yeah in that the uh article that I sent
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
you titled the bottom line on breach
 
05:00:38.430 --> 05:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
um there is a table that talks about um
 
05:00:40.548 --> 05:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
the role of malpresentation and high
 
05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
highrisk bursts and neonatal outcomes
 
05:00:46.430 --> 05:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
and and the author does expound on um
 
05:00:48.430 --> 05:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
the setting also so like some of these
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
have different settings and you can see
 
05:00:53.070 --> 05:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
in the the findings what what the
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
settings were so there is there is some
 
05:00:57.430 --> 05:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
data on it although it's very limited um
 
05:00:59.948 --> 05:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
most studies didn't differentiate that
 
05:01:01.470 --> 05:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
some studies don't differentiate whether
 
05:01:03.628 --> 05:01:03.638 align:start position:0%
they're planned um
 
05:01:06.430 --> 05:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
vaginal breach births or
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
unplanned um or if the provider was
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
trained in that or not and it's also
 
05:01:12.750 --> 05:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
important to mention there are
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
organizations that specialize in
 
05:01:17.628 --> 05:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
training these birth workers for um
 
05:01:20.190 --> 05:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
delivering vaginal breach births um and
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
of course they're going to have a higher
 
05:01:23.470 --> 05:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
success rate
 
05:01:26.948 --> 05:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
um and there's also organizations such
 
05:01:28.830 --> 05:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
as breach Without Borders who will offer
 
05:01:31.868 --> 05:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
telea Health um Services during a birth
 
05:01:36.788 --> 05:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
to assist with that and um and there's
 
05:01:40.110 --> 05:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
also if we're talking about the risks
 
05:01:42.590 --> 05:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
and tradeoffs on
 
05:01:47.310 --> 05:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
page it says 15 but it's the back of the
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
second page in that packet there's kind
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
of a comparison between the risks of
 
05:01:55.948 --> 05:01:55.958 align:start position:0%
cesarian section and the risks of a
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
planned breach um vaginal
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
birth and so there are some like for
 
05:02:05.310 --> 05:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
every it would take I believe it
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
was 8500 elective
 
05:02:09.240 --> 05:02:10.750 align:start position:0%
was 8500 elective
C-sections

05:02:10.750 --> 05:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
C-sections
 
05:02:15.110 --> 05:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
um for for breach babies from there were
 
05:02:17.150 --> 05:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
8,500 elective C-sections for breach
 
05:02:19.470 --> 05:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
babies from 2001 to
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
2005 that 8,500 potentially saved 19
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
babies that's wonderful and then there's
 
05:02:27.868 --> 05:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
but there's also the cost of four
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
avoidable maternal deaths for c-section
 
05:02:32.510 --> 05:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
on the other side nine fetal deaths in
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
the future due to a uterine scar so if
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
there's a scar and the placenta attaches
 
05:02:40.350 --> 05:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
to the scar it can cause um an abruption
 
05:02:42.708 --> 05:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
later and then the baby loses their
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
blood supply um 140 life-threatening
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
maternal complications in future future
 
05:02:50.510 --> 05:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
PR pregnancies as well so there's a big
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
picture that needs to be considered not
 
05:02:56.910 --> 05:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
just the breach um delivery itself but
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
other risk factors and then the risk of
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
starian section
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
alone other
 
05:03:13.868 --> 05:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:16.350 --> 05:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
05:03:19.830 --> 05:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative Paige bman from NASA May
 
05:03:22.548 --> 05:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:25.150 --> 05:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
for having me here
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee um some of you met me last
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
week my name is Paige boschman I am a
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
registered nurse I have been a nurse
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
nearly 15 years and most of that time um
 
05:03:40.030 --> 05:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
I have been working under the Midwifery
 
05:03:42.510 --> 05:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
model of care I am not a midwife thought
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
I wanted to be not my deal I don't want
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
to resuscitate babies um but I an
 
05:03:50.070 --> 05:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
educator and a lot of that education has
 
05:03:52.430 --> 05:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
been on educating the public about the
 
05:03:54.110 --> 05:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
difference between certified nurse
 
05:03:57.150 --> 05:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
midwives professional midwives Midwifery
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
care and the and the merits of it which
 
05:04:02.830 --> 05:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
are very high um I would like to thank
 
05:04:04.830 --> 05:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative kushman for bringing this
 
05:04:07.230 --> 05:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
up I think that it's a big issue that we
 
05:04:10.030 --> 05:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
need to be talking about more and I
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
think that the intent of it is frankly a
 
05:04:15.868 --> 05:04:15.878 align:start position:0%
it's a refreshing relief um at the same
 
05:04:18.830 --> 05:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
time I have just a few concerns about it
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to really clarify the
 
05:04:22.510 --> 05:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
difference between a certified nurse
 
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
Midwife which a certified nurse Midwife
 
05:04:27.628 --> 05:04:27.638 align:start position:0%
has a bachelor's degree in nursing and
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
then goes on to get a master's or higher
 
05:04:32.548 --> 05:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
level degree as an advanced practice
 
05:04:34.830 --> 05:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
registered nurse they are very similar
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
to say a women's nurse practitioner that
 
05:04:40.350 --> 05:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
is the level of training that they have
 
05:04:42.990 --> 05:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh certified professional midwives also
 
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
highly trained just in a different model
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm not as familiar with the extent
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
but you've got the resources for that
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand the
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
difference but that we use the word
 
05:04:55.470 --> 05:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
Midwife for both even though they have
 
05:04:58.110 --> 05:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
different trainings and practice to be
 
05:05:01.390 --> 05:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
very clear this bill spe is specific to
 
05:05:04.510 --> 05:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
the certified professional midwives they
 
05:05:06.750 --> 05:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
have their own Council by which they are
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
regulated which is different from CNM
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
which are regulated and licensed through
 
05:05:14.350 --> 05:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
05:05:16.350 --> 05:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
Services I would like to say that
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
Midwifery care is amazing I've had all
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
of my babies with midwives I've been
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
that person that had one cesarian one
 
05:05:27.868 --> 05:05:27.878 align:start position:0%
v-back and then wanted another vack and
 
05:05:30.868 --> 05:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
had to transfer from a CPM to the
 
05:05:32.670 --> 05:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
hospital and have a C-section so I
 
05:05:35.430 --> 05:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
really understand this situation the
 
05:05:37.150 --> 05:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
biggest concern that I have after
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
speaking with CNM and cpms in this state
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
is that this request didn't come from
 
05:05:46.030 --> 05:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
the council and there is some
 
05:05:48.910 --> 05:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
significant concern on their end reason
 
05:05:52.628 --> 05:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
being uh Midwifery has not been taken
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
seriously for many many decades and it's
 
05:05:57.030 --> 05:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
taken the last few decades for them to
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
gain the reputation that they deserve
 
05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
midwives provide very very safe
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
maternity care and births for lowrisk
 
05:06:09.070 --> 05:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and in fact one of their
 
05:06:12.670 --> 05:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
greatest skills is recognizing when a
 
05:06:14.750 --> 05:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
higher risk comes up and then
 
05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
transferring them their care to obig um
 
05:06:20.350 --> 05:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
which is which is uh it's it's the way
 
05:06:21.990 --> 05:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we should be working
 
05:06:25.270 --> 05:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
together in terms of of this some of the
 
05:06:28.270 --> 05:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
midwives are concerned that the bill as
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
written could lead to worse outcomes
 
05:06:35.110 --> 05:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
which could tarnish their hard works for
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
reputation which they've established in
 
05:06:40.510 --> 05:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
the state so as a recommendation again I
 
05:06:43.548 --> 05:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we discuss this but
 
05:06:46.190 --> 05:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
we turn it back to the council and the
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
midwives in the state and ask them what
 
05:06:51.390 --> 05:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
what would they like to be able to do
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
what makes sense to them what are they
 
05:06:55.470 --> 05:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing in addition to that
 
05:06:56.708 --> 05:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
three minutes are up if you could please
 
05:06:58.750 --> 05:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
start wrapping up I will absolutely add
 
05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
one more point and the one point was um
 
05:07:03.788 --> 05:07:03.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of the distance from the
 
05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
hospital another thing we should talk
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
about is that due to reimbursement we're
 
05:07:11.548 --> 05:07:11.558 align:start position:0%
seeing across the country but also in
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire maternity Wards closing
 
05:07:18.110 --> 05:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
down in hospital after hospital and if
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
we do continue with this distance from
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
hospital rules it makes it less and less
 
05:07:25.548 --> 05:07:25.558 align:start position:0%
accessible there's lots of problems with
 
05:07:28.030 --> 05:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
closing maternity units anyway but it
 
05:07:32.548 --> 05:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
makes this even harder um to adhere to
 
05:07:34.350 --> 05:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank Youk you any questions
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative n upam thank you Mr chair
 
05:07:41.310 --> 05:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
so overall are you against this bill as
 
05:07:43.430 --> 05:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
it is currently written I'm sorry yes
 
05:07:46.350 --> 05:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to the bill as written okay
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representa Merchant thank you
 
05:07:52.750 --> 05:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking the
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
question in regards to a hospital is it
 
05:07:59.110 --> 05:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
required the hospital have maternity
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
care or just that they have to be close
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
to a hospital so I won't say what I'm
 
05:08:07.750 --> 05:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
understanding from this is that for most
 
05:08:11.230 --> 05:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
midwives who will deliver in a
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
freestanding birth center or attend home
 
05:08:16.708 --> 05:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
births right now there is there's
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
usually a recommendation for how far a
 
05:08:22.590 --> 05:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
that space can be say a person's home
 
05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
from the nearest maternity unit so that
 
05:08:27.270 --> 05:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
if a birth becomes high risk and they
 
05:08:29.548 --> 05:08:29.558 align:start position:0%
need to transfer they're close enough to
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
get that care in
 
05:08:31.200 --> 05:08:34.788 align:start position:0%
get that care in
time

05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:36.990 --> 05:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative South King thank you Mr
 
05:08:38.830 --> 05:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you for taking
 
05:08:40.750 --> 05:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
questions I always love your testimony
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
because you come from such experience
 
05:08:43.948 --> 05:08:43.958 align:start position:0%
when you you know you have such
 
05:08:46.110 --> 05:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
experience in what you're talking about
 
05:08:47.788 --> 05:08:47.798 align:start position:0%
I I did forget to mention I'm I'm
 
05:08:49.868 --> 05:08:49.878 align:start position:0%
representative so thank you for those
 
05:08:51.070 --> 05:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
that didn't
 
05:08:51.080 --> 05:08:52.830 align:start position:0%
that didn't
know

05:08:52.830 --> 05:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:08:55.708 --> 05:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned
 
05:08:59.070 --> 05:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
that this isn't coming from the
 
05:08:59.080 --> 05:09:00.628 align:start position:0%
that this isn't coming from the
council

05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
council
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
and what I don't understand is so the
 
05:09:08.110 --> 05:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
council is made up of people who I think
 
05:09:09.788 --> 05:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
the reason why this bill is being
 
05:09:12.750 --> 05:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
introduced is because it the council has
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
historically been overly conservative in
 
05:09:19.150 --> 05:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
the ru making and this is sort
 
05:09:23.310 --> 05:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
of taking um taking the risk away from
 
05:09:24.830 --> 05:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
the council you know because the council
 
05:09:26.910 --> 05:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to make make a rule that
 
05:09:28.708 --> 05:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
could backfire and then they get blamed
 
05:09:30.868 --> 05:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
and we're taking the responsibility for
 
05:09:33.430 --> 05:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
for overriding their their rules so my
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
question is is the council only made up
 
05:09:39.548 --> 05:09:39.558 align:start position:0%
of people that are like really staunchly
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
Pro Midwife or can it also be filled
 
05:09:44.708 --> 05:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
with people that generally have a
 
05:09:47.590 --> 05:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
negative view of Midwifery thank you
 
05:09:49.350 --> 05:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
there are thank you for your question I
 
05:09:51.548 --> 05:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
know that there are folks who represent
 
05:09:53.868 --> 05:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
that Council and so I'll let them speak
 
05:09:56.750 --> 05:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
to that fully my understanding is it's
 
05:10:00.310 --> 05:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
made up of cpms to regul and they're in
 
05:10:03.310 --> 05:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
I'll let them I'll let them answer it
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay other
 
05:10:08.708 --> 05:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
05:10:15.230 --> 05:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:18.270 --> 05:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
time also signed up to speak and I hope
 
05:10:21.110 --> 05:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
I can pronounce this correctly Kathy
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
Chang from dmouth
 
05:10:26.788 --> 05:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
hiscock am I
 
05:10:30.270 --> 05:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
close okay good uh you asked for five
 
05:10:31.628 --> 05:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
minutes could you keep it closer to 3
 
05:10:39.270 --> 05:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:41.628 --> 05:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
please there you go can you guys hear me
 
05:10:44.030 --> 05:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
now oh yes okay so my name is Kathy
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
changai and I have been practicing
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
obgy for 27 years and um I submitted a
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
written article opposing this house bill
 
05:10:57.390 --> 05:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
and I cited at Washington Post article
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
investigative Journal uh that came out
 
05:11:04.110 --> 05:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
um in a state of Maryland where a couple
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
has filed a complaint against her
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
Midwife for poor outcome and I want to
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
say that in that article they cite that
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
home birth has twice the amount of
 
05:11:17.830 --> 05:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
infant mortality than Hospital birth the
 
05:11:20.110 --> 05:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
second position is that twin deliveries
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
or multiple gestation pregnancies are
 
05:11:25.708 --> 05:11:25.718 align:start position:0%
very high risk and um most of these
 
05:11:29.430 --> 05:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
babies are born pre-term and therefore
 
05:11:31.110 --> 05:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
when they're born pre-term they already
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
need Hospital ization and hospital care
 
05:11:37.150 --> 05:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
in my experience twin pregnancies are
 
05:11:39.190 --> 05:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
one of the more complicated conditions
 
05:11:41.868 --> 05:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
not only for the baby but also for the
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
mom and in my personal experience when
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm faced with delivering twins it is
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
something that I take very seriously so
 
05:11:52.510 --> 05:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
in my background I have done tons of
 
05:11:55.150 --> 05:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
deliveries both um in the setting of
 
05:11:58.030 --> 05:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
working in the hospital here in conquer
 
05:11:59.910 --> 05:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm now working at the Catholic
 
05:12:02.788 --> 05:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
Medical Center with certified nurse
 
05:12:05.350 --> 05:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
midwives we have a very collaborative
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
relationship with the midwives and I do
 
05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
support Midwifery care the distinction
 
05:12:15.030 --> 05:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
is that in this bill you are allowing
 
05:12:17.190 --> 05:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
deregulation of some of the restrictions
 
05:12:19.350 --> 05:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
that have been put in place to safeguard
 
05:12:23.548 --> 05:12:23.558 align:start position:0%
the patient so this bill allows patients
 
05:12:25.948 --> 05:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
or consumers to decide what is the best
 
05:12:29.230 --> 05:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
option for them in my opinion I think
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
the government and the regulatory board
 
05:12:35.590 --> 05:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
and the licensure committees exist to
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
protect the public and allow the lay
 
05:12:41.150 --> 05:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
public to make good decisions by
 
05:12:43.708 --> 05:12:43.718 align:start position:0%
allowing the public to decide now where
 
05:12:48.070 --> 05:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
to choose care I think it endangers the
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
consumer because late midwives working
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
in a hospital setting certified nurse
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
Midwifery um with doctors is a very safe
 
05:13:00.670 --> 05:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
environment but if it is a freestanding
 
05:13:02.910 --> 05:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
home delivery situation
 
05:13:04.510 --> 05:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
the multiple birth
 
05:13:07.150 --> 05:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancies unstable presentation such
 
05:13:10.510 --> 05:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
as breach and mother's laboring with
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
prior uterine scars is a very high-risk
 
05:13:16.868 --> 05:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
situation and the American College of
 
05:13:21.548 --> 05:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
OBGYN stand to support deliveries of
 
05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
Prior cesarian deliveries in a hospital
 
05:13:27.788 --> 05:13:27.798 align:start position:0%
setting um and the twin deliveries also
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
should be supported by high-risk Obi
 
05:13:30.798 --> 05:13:32.590 align:start position:0%
should be supported by high-risk Obi
doctors

05:13:32.590 --> 05:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
so my position is that this bill uh
 
05:13:38.510 --> 05:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
opposes the choice of seeking care to
 
05:13:40.548 --> 05:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
the lay public and I think the
 
05:13:43.350 --> 05:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
government and its agencies should exist
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
to protect the public for making good
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
choices and good options and by
 
05:13:49.868 --> 05:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
deregulating or allowing the patients to
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
have more choice in this particular
 
05:13:55.788 --> 05:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
situation it is um reckless endangerment
 
05:14:00.190 --> 05:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:02.270 --> 05:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
public okay thank you questions
 
05:14:02.280 --> 05:14:04.868 align:start position:0%
public okay thank you questions

05:14:07.030 --> 05:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:14:09.270 --> 05:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question your testimony
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
brings up something that I hadn't even
 
05:14:12.310 --> 05:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
thought about
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
before um when a patient has a
 
05:14:20.708 --> 05:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:23.868 --> 05:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
midwife and a complication
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
arises and the certified
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
midwife um is is is either required to
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
or decides that the patient needs to be
 
05:14:35.670 --> 05:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
transported to a
 
05:14:38.868 --> 05:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
hospital does the relationship with that
 
05:14:41.948 --> 05:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
Midwife end at that point or does the
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
Midwife continue to support the patient
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
but supported by the more specialized
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
levels of care I mean it sounded to me
 
05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
when I was listening earlier that if the
 
05:14:54.878 --> 05:14:56.548 align:start position:0%
when I was listening earlier that if the
Midwife

05:14:56.548 --> 05:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
Midwife
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
isn't um if if the rules prohibit the
 
05:15:03.070 --> 05:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
Midwife from from doing the delivery
 
05:15:05.948 --> 05:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
that that care ends and I'm I'm I think
 
05:15:08.030 --> 05:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's very individual some midwives will
 
05:15:09.990 --> 05:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
come with the patients to the hospital
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
but I think um that is pretty individual
 
05:15:15.310 --> 05:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
so in my personal experience um some of
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
the more difficult outcomes or poor
 
05:15:19.628 --> 05:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
outcomes were associated with frees
 
05:15:21.750 --> 05:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
sending mid Vibes doing deliveries at
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
home that did not end well and as
 
05:15:27.628 --> 05:15:27.638 align:start position:0%
doctors were're taking uh all comers and
 
05:15:29.628 --> 05:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
taking care of patients equally but when
 
05:15:31.708 --> 05:15:31.718 align:start position:0%
you're spaced with a situation that in
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
my opinion could have been prevented or
 
05:15:35.430 --> 05:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
proactive care
 
05:15:37.910 --> 05:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
administered uh it is kind of hard so
 
05:15:39.750 --> 05:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
there have been a there have been two
 
05:15:42.270 --> 05:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
cases of infant death when I was at
 
05:15:46.110 --> 05:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
coner hospital um associated with the
 
05:15:50.190 --> 05:15:50.200 align:start position:0%
Midwife delivery um gone I guess uh not
 
05:15:54.190 --> 05:15:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
home representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:16:01.830 --> 05:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
question um we've heard a lot about the
 
05:16:05.150 --> 05:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
training of midwives um the nurse
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
practitioners that care for these
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
patients for physicians obgyn like
 
05:16:10.628 --> 05:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
yourself that take care of these
 
05:16:13.628 --> 05:16:13.638 align:start position:0%
patients if you took this bill and you
 
05:16:16.350 --> 05:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
substituted the word experienced highly
 
05:16:18.628 --> 05:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
trained OBGYN with many years of
 
05:16:21.590 --> 05:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
experience for Midwifery or the Midwife
 
05:16:23.708 --> 05:16:23.718 align:start position:0%
would it still meet the standard of care
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh taking care of patients pregnant
 
05:16:27.548 --> 05:16:27.558 align:start position:0%
women in their babies so what you're
 
05:16:29.910 --> 05:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
saying is doing an an obgy and trained
 
05:16:32.030 --> 05:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
doctor like me doing a free sending home
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
birth right with any of these potential
 
05:16:36.590 --> 05:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know scenarios um I would not sign
 
05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
up for that thank
 
05:16:43.110 --> 05:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
you representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
05:16:46.510 --> 05:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
chairman so when my um oldest daughter
 
05:16:50.310 --> 05:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
was born um we were going to a
 
05:16:54.350 --> 05:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
freestanding um birthing center um with
 
05:16:57.430 --> 05:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
nurse midwives and
 
05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
um my daughter was breach and um
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
continued to be breach and so she risked
 
05:17:06.990 --> 05:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
out of that program and was delivered in
 
05:17:09.830 --> 05:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
a hospital by the associated
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
doctor um
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it went fine um so it was a a
 
05:17:22.670 --> 05:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
vaginal birth and it went fine so what
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
would my wife and my daughter have
 
05:17:28.390 --> 05:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
risked by being in
 
05:17:32.110 --> 05:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
a a setting other than a hospital and
 
05:17:34.270 --> 05:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
what were the risks even in a hospital
 
05:17:36.670 --> 05:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
and how would having been in a hospital
 
05:17:40.230 --> 05:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
mitigated those risks had something I
 
05:17:43.948 --> 05:17:43.958 align:start position:0%
mean I understand from earlier testimony
 
05:17:45.910 --> 05:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
that those kinds of births are not done
 
05:17:48.788 --> 05:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire um but if
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
they were done what what is the risk
 
05:17:52.510 --> 05:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about what is what
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
could go wrong okay so um to answer that
 
05:17:57.430 --> 05:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
question in a hospital setting you have
 
05:18:00.110 --> 05:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
a operating room ready for anything
 
05:18:03.948 --> 05:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
emergent in a Brie birth if um if the
 
05:18:06.510 --> 05:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
baby is entrapped in the mother's um
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
womb after the body delivers the head is
 
05:18:11.230 --> 05:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
ENT trapped that is a very difficult
 
05:18:13.868 --> 05:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
situation and um and so I think you just
 
05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
have more resources so that if there are
 
05:18:18.150 --> 05:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
any unforeseen emergencies that can be
 
05:18:20.708 --> 05:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
taken care of quickly if you're in a
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
freestanding uh situation and you're
 
05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
kind of far from the hospital even if
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's like within 10 or 15 minutes if the
 
05:18:30.830 --> 05:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
baby's you know not delivered in a
 
05:18:33.310 --> 05:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
timely manner it could affect the
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
outcome and I differ with the midwives
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
position that hospitals do not allow
 
05:18:39.628 --> 05:18:39.638 align:start position:0%
breach birth it is a shared
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
decision-making process and we do offer
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
external calic version so mothers have a
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
choice with their doctor to decide if
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
they want to try to turn the baby um
 
05:18:52.670 --> 05:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
breach deliveries are kind of tricky so
 
05:18:55.788 --> 05:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
as an OBGYN in my 27 years of experience
 
05:18:57.390 --> 05:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
I don't do a lot of breach birth because
 
05:18:59.670 --> 05:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
we're not doing a lot to begin with but
 
05:19:03.230 --> 05:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
I did have a breach birth vaginally at
 
05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
CMC with my Midwife at 3 in the morning
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
and everything went fine so it depends
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
on the situation so it depends on your
 
05:19:10.910 --> 05:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
comfort level and how the patient's
 
05:19:13.030 --> 05:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
doing but the amount of resources that
 
05:19:15.190 --> 05:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
you have allows you to feel the Comfort
 
05:19:18.830 --> 05:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
to take something on that's potentially
 
05:19:22.030 --> 05:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
risky thank you representative
 
05:19:25.070 --> 05:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
Weber so I think that you've answered my
 
05:19:27.270 --> 05:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
question with that last answer but I I
 
05:19:29.430 --> 05:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
was going to ask is it true that there
 
05:19:31.868 --> 05:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
are no breach births
 
05:19:34.628 --> 05:19:34.638 align:start position:0%
done vaginally in hospitals and what I'm
 
05:19:37.470 --> 05:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
hearing you say is no that that does
 
05:19:40.030 --> 05:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
happen but it's very much an individual
 
05:19:41.628 --> 05:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
am I right in thinking it's very much an
 
05:19:44.070 --> 05:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
individual consultation and decision yes
 
05:19:45.788 --> 05:19:45.798 align:start position:0%
it is really a shared decision between
 
05:19:48.270 --> 05:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
you as a provider and the patient so if
 
05:19:51.470 --> 05:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
you're somebody who has uh some anxiety
 
05:19:52.948 --> 05:19:52.958 align:start position:0%
or you don't have a lot of comfort
 
05:19:54.910 --> 05:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
because of your training you it is your
 
05:19:56.390 --> 05:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
obligation to let the patient know what
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
your comfort zone is and you can call a
 
05:20:00.190 --> 05:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
backup doctor and sometimes that happens
 
05:20:01.948 --> 05:20:01.958 align:start position:0%
if the patient is really motivated and
 
05:20:03.830 --> 05:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
you want the best option for the patient
 
05:20:06.030 --> 05:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
which you determine is a vaginal attempt
 
05:20:08.030 --> 05:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
you would try to see what you can do to
 
05:20:09.750 --> 05:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
allow the vaginal birth to happen so it
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
happens invariably but again breach
 
05:20:12.868 --> 05:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
deliveries are not something that we are
 
05:20:15.868 --> 05:20:15.878 align:start position:0%
trained to do um currently in this model
 
05:20:17.590 --> 05:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
but it's not discouraged and it's not
 
05:20:19.788 --> 05:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
05:20:22.548 --> 05:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
prohibited representative South King
 
05:20:25.548 --> 05:20:25.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:20:28.270 --> 05:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
questions I think we've established that
 
05:20:31.230 --> 05:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh midwives are highly trained well
 
05:20:31.240 --> 05:20:32.310 align:start position:0%
uh midwives are highly trained well
educated

05:20:32.310 --> 05:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
educated
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
individuals um would you agree with that
 
05:20:38.110 --> 05:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
yes okay follow up follow up um that
 
05:20:43.590 --> 05:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
being said if under most circumstances a
 
05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
midwife is presented with one of these
 
05:20:50.830 --> 05:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
um scenarios do you think that they're
 
05:20:53.708 --> 05:20:53.718 align:start position:0%
automatically going to just take on the
 
05:20:55.948 --> 05:20:55.958 align:start position:0%
the task and and do this like at a home
 
05:20:58.750 --> 05:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
birth or do you think that they're most
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
likely going to defer to the hospital
 
05:21:04.548 --> 05:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
anyways and the reason I asked that is
 
05:21:06.470 --> 05:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like based on the
 
05:21:08.548 --> 05:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
testimony of the co-sponsor or the
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor that um this you're not you're
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
you're not likely to see a lot of um
 
05:21:17.948 --> 05:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
midwives performing births under these
 
05:21:22.470 --> 05:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
scenarios it's more for the patient who
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
refuses to go to a hospital and this at
 
05:21:28.670 --> 05:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
least allows somebody to be there who is
 
05:21:31.390 --> 05:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
trained to help with the birth as
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to them having birth all alone
 
05:21:36.510 --> 05:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
so can you just what are you what are
 
05:21:38.310 --> 05:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on I really don't know
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
what um was the impetus for the house
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
build to be presented um so maybe that's
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
it that for these patients who truly
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
choose not to be in a hospital setting
 
05:21:49.708 --> 05:21:49.718 align:start position:0%
it allows them some whery or some
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
obstetrical support care yeah I really I
 
05:21:55.150 --> 05:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know if I can answer that
 
05:21:57.190 --> 05:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
fairly because I'm a little bit biased
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:02.590 --> 05:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
experience other
 
05:22:04.670 --> 05:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you seeing no other
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:11.910 --> 05:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Beth
 
05:22:19.590 --> 05:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:21.590 --> 05:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
Council you've asked for two to three
 
05:22:25.708 --> 05:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
fine U yes I now maybe yeah that's good
 
05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
okay I'm my name is Beth Gabby I'm a New
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certified midwife I do home
 
05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
birth in the state of New Hampshire for
 
05:22:38.990 --> 05:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
the last 16
 
05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
years um before then I was in um
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania which is not a regulated
 
05:22:46.470 --> 05:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
State and we did um this is just a
 
05:22:48.670 --> 05:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
little story we did home breach and twin
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
deliveries in New Hampshire we don't we
 
05:22:56.110 --> 05:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
we're regulated and um on behalf of the
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
Midwifery Council we oppose this bill as
 
05:23:05.830 --> 05:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
written um that said I invite anybody
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
who wants to have more discussion about
 
05:23:10.030 --> 05:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
the bill to come to the next Midwifery
 
05:23:12.190 --> 05:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
council meeting which is on February
 
05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
22nd on Thursday at 1:00 over at Eagle
 
05:23:20.590 --> 05:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
Square um the one so as a council we
 
05:23:23.110 --> 05:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill we had not heard about
 
05:23:25.310 --> 05:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
this nobody approached the council to
 
05:23:28.510 --> 05:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
discuss this um we have very being a
 
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
regulated St State we have um um rules
 
05:23:33.190 --> 05:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
and very clear guidelines when you
 
05:23:35.190 --> 05:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
consult when you transfer what is
 
05:23:38.190 --> 05:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
considered a lowrisk birth and um in
 
05:23:40.628 --> 05:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
those guidelines we consider breach
 
05:23:43.430 --> 05:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
birth and twin births a higher risk
 
05:23:45.910 --> 05:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
birth that
 
05:23:48.270 --> 05:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
said there's room for more discussion
 
05:23:52.390 --> 05:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
about this bill because the the OBS do
 
05:23:54.150 --> 05:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
not do breach births in the hospital
 
05:23:57.548 --> 05:23:57.558 align:start position:0%
they are incredibly rare and when we
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
when we call ahead if we have a a breach
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
delivery we need to come to the hospital
 
05:24:05.070 --> 05:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have nurses say well better not
 
05:24:06.910 --> 05:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
come here go to some other Hospital
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
nobody here is going to do this um we
 
05:24:12.270 --> 05:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
were trying to find um somebody willing
 
05:24:14.948 --> 05:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
to do a breach delivery and the and to
 
05:24:18.430 --> 05:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
my opinion or my experience the obes are
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
not there are a couple who are
 
05:24:22.590 --> 05:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
interested in helping us out helping out
 
05:24:25.548 --> 05:24:25.558 align:start position:0%
the women if they're you know there are
 
05:24:27.868 --> 05:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
guidelines as what's a higher R risk
 
05:24:30.910 --> 05:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
breach versus what's a lower risk breach
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
and um so there is a lot of Education in
 
05:24:35.708 --> 05:24:35.718 align:start position:0%
the Midwifery sphere that I think is
 
05:24:38.628 --> 05:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
very useful to OBS and midwives in
 
05:24:42.590 --> 05:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
general so I guess that's that'll I'll
 
05:24:45.310 --> 05:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
end my I'll repeat the last thing is
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we oppose this bill the Midwifery
 
05:24:51.190 --> 05:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
Council however I am interested in more
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
discussion about opening up choices for
 
05:24:56.670 --> 05:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
mothers who are a decent candidate who
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
have a Frank breach to have a safe V
 
05:25:01.320 --> 05:25:03.750 align:start position:0%
have a Frank breach to have a safe V
breach

05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:06.110 --> 05:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
delivery thank you any
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative Seth King thank
 
05:25:11.110 --> 05:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:25:15.030 --> 05:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions um I gleaned from previous um
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
testimony that the Midwife council is
 
05:25:20.548 --> 05:25:20.558 align:start position:0%
full of individuals who are midwives
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
themselves and are pro Midwifery is that
 
05:25:24.628 --> 05:25:24.638 align:start position:0%
correct yeah I'll just tell you who's on
 
05:25:27.788 --> 05:25:27.798 align:start position:0%
the council we have one obstetrician one
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
pediatrician three midwives and one
 
05:25:33.788 --> 05:25:33.798 align:start position:0%
public member okay thank you follow up
 
05:25:33.798 --> 05:25:34.590 align:start position:0%
public member okay thank you follow up
follow

05:25:34.590 --> 05:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:25:37.788 --> 05:25:37.798 align:start position:0%
up um it was also alluded to by a
 
05:25:40.510 --> 05:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
previous um individual
 
05:25:46.030 --> 05:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
that by liberalizing the the rules for
 
05:25:48.910 --> 05:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
Midwifery that there would be a fear
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
that something bad would happen and it
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
would look bad on Midwifery in general
 
05:25:57.628 --> 05:25:57.638 align:start position:0%
so by opposing uh by opposing this bill
 
05:26:00.670 --> 05:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if the reason the midwife
 
05:26:05.190 --> 05:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
council is against it has more to do
 
05:26:10.910 --> 05:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
with the safety of um the the birthing
 
05:26:12.990 --> 05:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
process or if
 
05:26:16.470 --> 05:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
because you're worried that something
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
bad will happen and then the legislator
 
05:26:20.590 --> 05:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
will down the line say that's it we're
 
05:26:22.390 --> 05:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
Banning Midwifery
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
altogether can you explain thank you
 
05:26:28.430 --> 05:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I um I I take a different
 
05:26:31.310 --> 05:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
approach than when you said liberalizing
 
05:26:34.670 --> 05:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
if feel liberalizing the the rules to me
 
05:26:38.190 --> 05:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
it's more like um we could not move
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
forward with this because we need there
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be training you can't just say
 
05:26:46.670 --> 05:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a midwife I deliver breach there are
 
05:26:48.548 --> 05:26:48.558 align:start position:0%
and there are great trainings from
 
05:26:51.030 --> 05:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
Midwifery in the Midwifery sphere which
 
05:26:53.110 --> 05:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
is very to my mind very different than
 
05:26:55.350 --> 05:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
what the OBS are learning is very
 
05:26:57.150 --> 05:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
different from what the The Midwives are
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
learning I'd love there to be some cross
 
05:27:02.430 --> 05:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
talking there but midwives in New
 
05:27:04.750 --> 05:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they would have to show that
 
05:27:07.390 --> 05:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
they have had specialized training in
 
05:27:10.750 --> 05:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
breach it's not it's um that's not a
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
given and um so there are places to get
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
that you can go to Tennessee you can go
 
05:27:17.788 --> 05:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
to the Border you can go to Haiti you
 
05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
can go all over the place and get
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
training in from midwives but um we
 
05:27:25.390 --> 05:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
don't have that right now we also we the
 
05:27:27.470 --> 05:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
insurance we we can have insurance
 
05:27:29.948 --> 05:27:29.958 align:start position:0%
coverage because we're regulated um if
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
we choose to we would like to know would
 
05:27:35.230 --> 05:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
insurance companies cover us if we did
 
05:27:37.590 --> 05:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
breach deliveries um would a midwife
 
05:27:39.270 --> 05:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
have to agree not to do breach delivery
 
05:27:40.548 --> 05:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
if she wanted to take insurance these
 
05:27:44.430 --> 05:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
are unanswered questions um Al so it's
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
just as the rules are currently it's not
 
05:27:49.150 --> 05:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
in the rules and I think you need to go
 
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
through a stepwise progression to
 
05:27:53.708 --> 05:27:53.718 align:start position:0%
introduce it and cover the safety it is
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
a public
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
safety um issue the the council is in
 
05:28:01.230 --> 05:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
place to keep the public safe
 
05:28:03.910 --> 05:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
and so we wouldn't willy-nilly say okay
 
05:28:06.110 --> 05:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
now midwives can do twins and breaches
 
05:28:10.750 --> 05:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
at home because we haven't stepped up to
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
those safety measures so rather than
 
05:28:14.510 --> 05:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
liberalizing which feels like you're
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
kind of taking away barriers it's more
 
05:28:19.270 --> 05:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
like stepping it up to make sure that
 
05:28:22.628 --> 05:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
you have um safety measures in
 
05:28:25.150 --> 05:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
place representative Murphy and then
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
representative mlan thank you thank you
 
05:28:29.470 --> 05:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
for the qu taking the question so is a
 
05:28:31.310 --> 05:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
followup to representative King's
 
05:28:33.470 --> 05:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
question in a sense I was curious as to
 
05:28:36.430 --> 05:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
why the council actually opposed the
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
bill but are you saying that if the
 
05:28:41.548 --> 05:28:41.558 align:start position:0%
midwives were specifically trained in
 
05:28:41.558 --> 05:28:42.510 align:start position:0%
midwives were specifically trained in
breach

05:28:42.510 --> 05:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
breach
 
05:28:45.430 --> 05:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
deliveries that as written then with
 
05:28:47.350 --> 05:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
that Amendment they you would be
 
05:28:49.230 --> 05:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
supportive of this meaning that you
 
05:28:51.070 --> 05:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
would have home deliveries for breach
 
05:28:53.990 --> 05:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
babies prior C-sections
 
05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
Etc so I I'm taking I would take
 
05:28:59.830 --> 05:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
separately twins as a separate question
 
05:29:01.628 --> 05:29:01.638 align:start position:0%
the breach is a separate question and
 
05:29:05.470 --> 05:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
the cerian separate question as well as
 
05:29:08.948 --> 05:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
um the minutes away from the hospital
 
05:29:12.190 --> 05:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
which is also in here I would I would I
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth more discussion
 
05:29:15.120 --> 05:29:16.390 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth more discussion
simply

05:29:16.390 --> 05:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
simply
 
05:29:18.750 --> 05:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
because if anybody's ever heard of free
 
05:29:22.390 --> 05:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
birthers free birth um in the we it's
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
people who who do not use a midwife and
 
05:29:26.628 --> 05:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
do not use an OB and they and they have
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
they do their own birth unassisted at
 
05:29:31.470 --> 05:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
home and there is truth there not very
 
05:29:34.110 --> 05:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
many but there is a there is there is
 
05:29:37.788 --> 05:29:37.798 align:start position:0%
enough to talk about women who will
 
05:29:40.470 --> 05:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
not who will enter a more risky
 
05:29:40.480 --> 05:29:41.990 align:start position:0%
not who will enter a more risky
situation

05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
because they they cannot have their
 
05:29:49.750 --> 05:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
their vaginal Bach delivery from any
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
practitioner um that's available
 
05:29:55.628 --> 05:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
midwives obese um I got off track I
 
05:29:57.948 --> 05:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
don't remember the question I'm sorry
 
05:30:00.390 --> 05:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
just follow follow up so so again to
 
05:30:02.910 --> 05:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
clear I guess we oh open to conversation
 
05:30:04.510 --> 05:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
I guess the point is is as this bill
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
stands now we're opposed but I invite
 
05:30:09.390 --> 05:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
people to come to the council meeting
 
05:30:11.788 --> 05:30:11.798 align:start position:0%
and discuss it because there are women
 
05:30:14.910 --> 05:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
who don't have options and I think I
 
05:30:17.670 --> 05:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
think that's worth discussing sure so
 
05:30:20.788 --> 05:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
given the prior testimonies by midwives
 
05:30:23.390 --> 05:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
and Physicians about the increased risks
 
05:30:26.830 --> 05:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
with this subcategory of patients with
 
05:30:30.310 --> 05:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
home delivery even if the midwives were
 
05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
trained in breach deliveries would that
 
05:30:34.910 --> 05:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
change your opinion or the council's
 
05:30:37.110 --> 05:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
opinion about a home delivery in a
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
breach situation I would have to ask the
 
05:30:43.470 --> 05:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
council my personal opinion if there was
 
05:30:46.750 --> 05:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
a specific training and numbers of
 
05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
breaches that you had to show that you
 
05:30:50.788 --> 05:30:50.798 align:start position:0%
did and you could open up the
 
05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
possibility of having specialized
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
midwives specialized and breach who
 
05:30:56.910 --> 05:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
could do breach or maybe even do it with
 
05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
the ob in the hospital then yes I I am
 
05:31:02.070 --> 05:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
in favor of having that conversation in
 
05:31:04.788 --> 05:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
the hospital well even I mean Frank I
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
did breaches at home in Pennsylvania
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
very successfully so um I think there's
 
05:31:12.750 --> 05:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of fear around it um and I wasn't
 
05:31:14.470 --> 05:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
I wasn't trained with fear around
 
05:31:17.030 --> 05:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
breaches but we also had to triage there
 
05:31:19.390 --> 05:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
were certain breaches we did not do at
 
05:31:22.070 --> 05:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
home because they were higher risk
 
05:31:24.510 --> 05:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
breaches there are lower risk breaches
 
05:31:27.270 --> 05:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
as well representative mlan and then
 
05:31:29.788 --> 05:31:29.798 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you uh Mr
 
05:31:31.390 --> 05:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
so um leaving the the issue of the
 
05:31:36.670 --> 05:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
breaching aside um you you're talking
 
05:31:39.390 --> 05:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
about limited options for women I mean
 
05:31:41.070 --> 05:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not a doctor but I hear on the radio
 
05:31:42.990 --> 05:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
a lot we're closing down this Maternity
 
05:31:45.548 --> 05:31:45.558 align:start position:0%
Ward we're closing down that Maternity
 
05:31:49.070 --> 05:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
Ward so looking specifically at the
 
05:31:51.150 --> 05:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
distance provision because people's
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
access especially in the rural areas of
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
the state is diminishing um what are
 
05:31:58.430 --> 05:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
your thoughts um with respect to the
 
05:32:01.470 --> 05:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
distance provision um in the bill um
 
05:32:04.350 --> 05:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
maybe as it would relate to non highrisk
 
05:32:05.628 --> 05:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
births would you would you be
 
05:32:08.230 --> 05:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable um with that provision in
 
05:32:10.110 --> 05:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
the case of non- highrisk births or do
 
05:32:12.190 --> 05:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
you still have reservations around that
 
05:32:14.430 --> 05:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
so currently the regulations state that
 
05:32:16.868 --> 05:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
if you are having a home birth there is
 
05:32:20.310 --> 05:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
no um this is without this is not a
 
05:32:23.070 --> 05:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
v-back vaginal delivery after cerian
 
05:32:24.990 --> 05:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
vaginal birth after cerian that's a
 
05:32:28.510 --> 05:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
v-back we um there is a pro provision
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
that you need to be within 20 minutes of
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
the hospital if you don't have a vack
 
05:32:34.548 --> 05:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
and you're just having a vaginal
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
delivery there is not a time constraint
 
05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
on numbers of minutes away from a
 
05:32:41.350 --> 05:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
hospital so it doesn't like in the North
 
05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
Country when you're going to be far um
 
05:32:45.990 --> 05:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
there isn't however with a VB back
 
05:32:48.708 --> 05:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
there's the 20 minute provision in the
 
05:32:48.718 --> 05:32:49.788 align:start position:0%
there's the 20 minute provision in the
current

05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:32:49.798 --> 05:32:51.590 align:start position:0%
current
rules

05:32:51.590 --> 05:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:32:55.190 --> 05:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
follow um and is do do you think that's
 
05:32:57.548 --> 05:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
that's a valid um so I'm just looking at
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
because people in rural areas access so
 
05:33:03.750 --> 05:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
in my in my op this is my personal
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
opinion because I haven't discussed this
 
05:33:08.830 --> 05:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
with the council my personal opinion is
 
05:33:12.510 --> 05:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
um if you are going to have a v-back and
 
05:33:15.708 --> 05:33:15.718 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have a catastrophic
 
05:33:15.718 --> 05:33:16.788 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have a catastrophic
uterin

05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
uterin
 
05:33:19.470 --> 05:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
rupture then 20 minutes is too long to
 
05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
be away from a hospital so when we have
 
05:33:27.310 --> 05:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
um the the risk is low it's low enough
 
05:33:30.150 --> 05:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
that midwives in the state we we do
 
05:33:33.628 --> 05:33:33.638 align:start position:0%
vacks and we have women you know full
 
05:33:36.110 --> 05:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
disclosure they have to understand what
 
05:33:40.070 --> 05:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
the risk is but in my
 
05:33:43.390 --> 05:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
opinion it's fine if you are willing if
 
05:33:45.310 --> 05:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
you know you're a v-back and you're 45
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
minutes away then um then then that is
 
05:33:51.750 --> 05:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
totally fine because the risk is so
 
05:33:55.470 --> 05:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
small if you if you go into that small
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
percent if you are not in the hospital
 
05:34:01.590 --> 05:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
you are at risk you know you like 20
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
minutes doesn't make the difference you
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
like it's you want to be in the hospital
 
05:34:09.670 --> 05:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
fast so the so that's my personal
 
05:34:11.430 --> 05:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
opinion I would not have a problem with
 
05:34:13.350 --> 05:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
saying if somebody wants a VB back the
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
Lisk is so low I don't expect a
 
05:34:17.590 --> 05:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
catastrophic problem and they have the
 
05:34:19.628 --> 05:34:19.638 align:start position:0%
choice to understand that there is this
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
percent of a catastrophic problem and
 
05:34:23.708 --> 05:34:23.718 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm willing to take
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
that one more followup so just to
 
05:34:28.910 --> 05:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
clarify so um if you were to amend the
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill just to keep that section in you
 
05:34:32.910 --> 05:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
would still not be comfortable even with
 
05:34:35.830 --> 05:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
that section I don't really I don't
 
05:34:37.948 --> 05:34:37.958 align:start position:0%
really worry about that section okay
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative
 
05:34:44.590 --> 05:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman and also
 
05:34:46.910 --> 05:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking a question earlier
 
05:34:49.030 --> 05:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
I asked a question to represent of
 
05:34:52.430 --> 05:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
kushman about the complaints and
 
05:34:54.830 --> 05:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
investigations uh with midwife in the
 
05:34:56.430 --> 05:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I think it
 
05:34:59.110 --> 05:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
comes under the oplc I was on a
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee during the summer
 
05:35:03.788 --> 05:35:03.798 align:start position:0%
2022 that issue was raised about the
 
05:35:03.798 --> 05:35:04.750 align:start position:0%
2022 that issue was raised about the
number

05:35:04.750 --> 05:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:35:07.708 --> 05:35:07.718 align:start position:0%
of concerns that were raised by
 
05:35:09.868 --> 05:35:09.878 align:start position:0%
constituents by people who were
 
05:35:13.150 --> 05:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about their Midwife as far as
 
05:35:13.160 --> 05:35:14.190 align:start position:0%
concerned about their Midwife as far as
their

05:35:14.190 --> 05:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:35:16.510 --> 05:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
delivery and what I'm trying to get to
 
05:35:18.590 --> 05:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
is can you share with us as being on the
 
05:35:21.390 --> 05:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
advisor Council of mid rery um the
 
05:35:23.350 --> 05:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
number of complaints and concerns and so
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
forth that come to the council that have
 
05:35:26.910 --> 05:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
been investigated what the outcomes were
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
some idea what's out there publicly um
 
05:35:32.470 --> 05:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
just to clarify the question are you
 
05:35:35.150 --> 05:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
asking like how how frequent are the
 
05:35:37.708 --> 05:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
number of complaints about poor practice
 
05:35:39.628 --> 05:35:39.638 align:start position:0%
in mid rffe out
 
05:35:42.350 --> 05:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
there I wasn't quite sure exactly what
 
05:35:46.270 --> 05:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
the comment was at the time um but I
 
05:35:49.070 --> 05:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
believe there's about 34 35 midwives in
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire yeah and
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
there seem to be a disproportional
 
05:35:54.150 --> 05:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
number of complaints against that subset
 
05:35:55.750 --> 05:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
of 34 people compared to some of the
 
05:35:55.760 --> 05:35:57.270 align:start position:0%
of 34 people compared to some of the
other

05:35:57.270 --> 05:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:36:00.190 --> 05:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
professions well um I guess there's
 
05:36:01.548 --> 05:36:01.558 align:start position:0%
probably somebody who can answer this
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
better than I sitting on the council we
 
05:36:06.110 --> 05:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
get we receive those complaints we have
 
05:36:07.990 --> 05:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
very few
 
05:36:12.910 --> 05:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
complaints is is there a way pleas is
 
05:36:18.830 --> 05:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
there a way to quantify that with the
 
05:36:18.840 --> 05:36:20.350 align:start position:0%
there a way to quantify that with the
numbers

05:36:20.350 --> 05:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
um I I will have to ask for the the
 
05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
specific numbers like in a in a 5year
 
05:36:28.430 --> 05:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
period how many complaints we get I'm
 
05:36:30.788 --> 05:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
correct if I can what I'm trying to get
 
05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
to is what is the risk currently that
 
05:36:36.548 --> 05:36:36.558 align:start position:0%
people perceive um rightly or wrongly
 
05:36:38.670 --> 05:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's been voiced with the council to
 
05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
get a measurement of if we try to look
 
05:36:44.948 --> 05:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
at that going forward and we build on it
 
05:36:48.070 --> 05:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
are we looking at concerns complaints
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
with the mid if you will with the state
 
05:36:52.190 --> 05:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
where it is today because this will
 
05:36:54.390 --> 05:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
change things based upon some risk
 
05:36:56.310 --> 05:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
factors what that may mean to the
 
05:36:58.910 --> 05:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
constituents going forward okay the
 
05:36:58.920 --> 05:37:00.628 align:start position:0%
constituents going forward okay the
Baseline

05:37:00.628 --> 05:37:00.638 align:start position:0%
Baseline
 
05:37:03.830 --> 05:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
um I think the
 
05:37:06.788 --> 05:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
best if somebody has if somebody's able
 
05:37:08.110 --> 05:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
to voice that question a little
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
differently I might be able to
 
05:37:11.070 --> 05:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
understand it a little better okay may
 
05:37:12.990 --> 05:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
could you mind if it's just
 
05:37:16.948 --> 05:37:16.958 align:start position:0%
reworded for me so I'm
 
05:37:20.548 --> 05:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
sorry I think it would be very helpful
 
05:37:23.230 --> 05:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
at least for me not speaking for
 
05:37:25.868 --> 05:37:25.878 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant if we knew the
 
05:37:28.990 --> 05:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
number of complaints that you had had in
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
the last 5 years and whatever is
 
05:37:35.350 --> 05:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
publicly available as to the content of
 
05:37:37.030 --> 05:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
those complaints and their resolutions
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful okay I'm I'm
 
05:37:44.190 --> 05:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
happy to get that I um thank you off
 
05:37:46.750 --> 05:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
just to just to another point is that we
 
05:37:48.910 --> 05:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
get both if things that come to the
 
05:37:51.270 --> 05:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
counsel are both complaints from the
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
outside um whoever that may be as well
 
05:37:57.708 --> 05:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
as if a midwife herself has a
 
05:38:00.948 --> 05:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
significant morbidity or Mor Al it she
 
05:38:03.030 --> 05:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
reports that and so we look at all of
 
05:38:06.030 --> 05:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
those reports coming in the the the
 
05:38:08.910 --> 05:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
number of Eminem reports versus
 
05:38:13.470 --> 05:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
complaints it's very I mean we we get I
 
05:38:15.150 --> 05:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
would say in the last five years I mean
 
05:38:18.470 --> 05:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
we probably gotten less than five
 
05:38:20.948 --> 05:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
complaints um but I can get those exact
 
05:38:22.350 --> 05:38:22.360 align:start position:0%
numbers for
 
05:38:25.350 --> 05:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
05:38:27.510 --> 05:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
questions see no other questions thank

pregnancies out of the hospital with
 
05:40:07.070 --> 05:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
very little
 
05:40:09.230 --> 05:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
training it's important to understand
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
that a lay
 
05:40:13.948 --> 05:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
Midwife is
 
05:40:16.390 --> 05:40:16.400 align:start position:0%

diploma and observation of 25 vaginal
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
births by another lay Midwife as you've
 
05:40:26.070 --> 05:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
heard this is very different than a

certified nurse Midwife who has a
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in nursing and three
 
05:40:33.628 --> 05:40:33.638 align:start position:0%

hospitals under the supervision of
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians because they
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.548 --> 05:41:03.558 align:start position:0%
I had a year of internship after medical
 
05:41:05.948 --> 05:41:05.958 align:start position:0%
school and four years of OBG
 
05:41:10.150 --> 05:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
training I cannot imagine a certified
 
05:41:10.160 --> 05:41:11.190 align:start position:0%
training I cannot imagine a certified
lay

05:41:11.190 --> 05:41:11.200 align:start position:0%

05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancies who's had previous cerian
 
05:41:30.910 --> 05:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
sections these are situations that were
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
the most harrowing situations for
 
05:41:37.150 --> 05:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
me as a
 
05:41:40.548 --> 05:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
physician now I understand today the
 
05:41:43.590 --> 05:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
standard of care in most places is a
 
05:41:46.708 --> 05:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
cesarian section for breach presentation
 
05:41:50.990 --> 05:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
I trained and was trained to do breach
 
05:41:51.000 --> 05:41:52.230 align:start position:0%
I trained and was trained to do breach
vaginal

05:41:52.230 --> 05:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
vaginal
 
05:41:54.830 --> 05:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
deliveries but all of us who had that
 
05:41:57.390 --> 05:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
experience also
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
experienced occasionally a horrific
 
05:42:02.670 --> 05:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
complication with that delivery and I
 
05:42:06.190 --> 05:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to show you this is from
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh props that I use I'm s props that I
 
05:42:12.150 --> 05:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
use you can't use props and here oh
 
05:42:15.230 --> 05:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
really sorry okay well it's the after
 
05:42:18.548 --> 05:42:18.558 align:start position:0%
coming head to get stuck and it's very
 
05:42:21.468 --> 05:42:21.478 align:start position:0%
difficult to deliver and I know babies
 
05:42:24.350 --> 05:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
newborns have suffered death because of
 
05:42:27.270 --> 05:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
that I can't imagine delivering a breach
 
05:42:30.110 --> 05:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
baby out of a hospital situation and and
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
your time is running out please sum up
 
05:42:35.830 --> 05:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
please wrap up a second Twin can come
 
05:42:40.390 --> 05:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
down with an arm or a shoulder or a leg
 
05:42:44.548 --> 05:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
and be impossible to deliver
 
05:42:46.708 --> 05:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
vaginally twin pregnancy should be
 
05:42:49.070 --> 05:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
delivered in the hospital and finally
 
05:42:51.750 --> 05:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
some of us performed emergency surgery
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
after a ruptured
 
05:42:56.990 --> 05:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
uterus finding the baby floating in the
 
05:42:59.788 --> 05:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
abdomen I cannot imagine
 
05:43:02.190 --> 05:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
being in a home or outside of the
 
05:43:06.150 --> 05:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
hospital when that happens to my patient
 
05:43:06.160 --> 05:43:08.548 align:start position:0%
hospital when that happens to my patient
and

05:43:08.548 --> 05:43:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:13.070 --> 05:43:13.080 align:start position:0%

resuscitate her she ended
 
05:43:48.468 --> 05:43:48.478 align:start position:0%

Midwife or certified midwife who
 
05:44:18.310 --> 05:44:18.320 align:start position:0%

05:44:19.788 --> 05:44:19.798 align:start position:0%

05:44:23.150 --> 05:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
this please vote itl on this bill so
 
05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
that we're less likely to have babies
 
05:44:27.430 --> 05:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
any you taking questions are there any
 
05:44:29.708 --> 05:44:29.718 align:start position:0%
questions thank you

05:44:45.868 --> 05:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
set also signed up to speak is
 
05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative Emily
 
05:44:55.468 --> 05:44:55.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:57.990 --> 05:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon I am a co-sponsor
 
05:44:59.750 --> 05:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill uh representative Emily
 
05:45:01.150 --> 05:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
Phillips Fremont New Hampshire
 
05:45:03.708 --> 05:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 7 um this bill was brought
 
05:45:06.910 --> 05:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
forward because people asked us to um
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
birth is not a medical event or an
 
05:45:12.270 --> 05:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
emergency most of the time for a
 
05:45:15.070 --> 05:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
millennia midwives or late people if you
 
05:45:18.548 --> 05:45:18.558 align:start position:0%
will have been helping to birth children
 
05:45:22.830 --> 05:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
I myself um
 
05:45:26.670 --> 05:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
was was excluded from birthing vaginally
 
05:45:30.270 --> 05:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
um twice but um this the second time I
 
05:45:32.310 --> 05:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
ended up with a C-section based on a
 
05:45:35.150 --> 05:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
mirage of um a myriad sorry of
 
05:45:37.310 --> 05:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
interventions that were pushed upon me
 
05:45:38.788 --> 05:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
um in the hospital setting so I ended up
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
with two C-sections and then I couldn't
 
05:45:42.910 --> 05:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
find a provider to allow me to try to
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
deliver my child the way I wanted uh the
 
05:45:48.070 --> 05:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
only option offered to women in New
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let me be very clear is
 
05:45:52.350 --> 05:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
surgical okay for many of these
 
05:45:54.990 --> 05:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
conditions um so I was seeking a vaginal
 
05:45:58.910 --> 05:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
birth after uh a second cesarian and no
 
05:46:00.310 --> 05:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
body in this state this was two and a
 
05:46:02.670 --> 05:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
half years ago would allow me to deliver
 
05:46:04.350 --> 05:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
vaginally I played the good game and I
 
05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
went to the OBGYN I saw a midwife as co-
 
05:46:08.948 --> 05:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
care and I was just hoping that somebody
 
05:46:10.948 --> 05:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
was going to support my choice at 37
 
05:46:12.830 --> 05:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
weeks I asked for it to be considered
 
05:46:14.708 --> 05:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
individually based on my personal health
 
05:46:17.670 --> 05:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
in my pregnancy and not based on a label
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
and I was laughed at and I said I you
 
05:46:21.150 --> 05:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
were the they told me I was literally
 
05:46:22.430 --> 05:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
the worst candidate they had for a
 
05:46:25.390 --> 05:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
vaginal delivery there and so I went
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
home I gave birth in my bathtub alone
 
05:46:32.230 --> 05:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
with two douas douas are not medically
 
05:46:33.948 --> 05:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
trained they are birth support workers
 
05:46:36.190 --> 05:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm thankful they were there my
 
05:46:39.270 --> 05:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
baby had a double nucle cord he was fine
 
05:46:41.788 --> 05:46:41.798 align:start position:0%
um also that's a variation of normal I
 
05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
had two prior C-sections I did my
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
research and
 
05:46:48.070 --> 05:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
statistically um a woman who's had two
 
05:46:50.750 --> 05:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
prior C-sections C-sections are very
 
05:46:53.548 --> 05:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
serious surgical um surgeries and I
 
05:46:55.270 --> 05:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate Obstetricians who do them and
 
05:46:58.868 --> 05:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
they are necessary sometimes okay there
 
05:47:01.590 --> 05:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
is no way that you can say that major
 
05:47:04.390 --> 05:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
abdominal surgery is a no risk no big
 
05:47:06.190 --> 05:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
deal it's major surgery and if I want to
 
05:47:07.750 --> 05:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
go on to have a fourth child what is the
 
05:47:10.190 --> 05:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
risk to me for having three major
 
05:47:12.628 --> 05:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
C-sections when where does my wrist tip
 
05:47:14.830 --> 05:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
to the point where a uterine rupture
 
05:47:17.230 --> 05:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
also occurs at the same level when you
 
05:47:20.230 --> 05:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
get to your fourth C-section okay I want
 
05:47:21.948 --> 05:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
to live I want to raise the kids I have
 
05:47:23.510 --> 05:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
but I didn't want did not want to
 
05:47:25.110 --> 05:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
consent to surgery and nobody would
 
05:47:27.510 --> 05:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
allow me to try if I had shown up at a
 
05:47:29.350 --> 05:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
hospital and I'm sure an obset here can
 
05:47:32.030 --> 05:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
back me up if I had shown up and
 
05:47:34.750 --> 05:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
declined this surgery I was told I had
 
05:47:36.070 --> 05:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
to have they would fight me the whole
 
05:47:38.670 --> 05:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
way while I was trying to labor they
 
05:47:40.270 --> 05:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
would fight me and I've heard stories of
 
05:47:42.350 --> 05:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
women being denied pain medicine I've
 
05:47:44.030 --> 05:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
heard stories of women being treated
 
05:47:45.788 --> 05:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
poorly and triage and end up delivering
 
05:47:48.468 --> 05:47:48.478 align:start position:0%
in an ER because they're mad that the
 
05:47:50.310 --> 05:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
woman will not consent to their Hospital
 
05:47:52.788 --> 05:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
policy or or rule or whatever that they
 
05:47:55.548 --> 05:47:55.558 align:start position:0%
must consent to surgery women are free
 
05:47:57.868 --> 05:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
birthing in New Hampshire it's happening
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
around me friends with them I you know
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
that is within their risk to take I
 
05:48:04.590 --> 05:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
understand their statistics but it is my
 
05:48:08.190 --> 05:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
risk to take nobody faces more
 
05:48:10.948 --> 05:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
long-term um liability than the mother
 
05:48:12.590 --> 05:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
herself what happens in that birth would
 
05:48:15.070 --> 05:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
have been my fault okay my son is
 
05:48:16.430 --> 05:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
healthy and fine and everything went
 
05:48:17.910 --> 05:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
well statistically I knew that would be
 
05:48:19.230 --> 05:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
the case instead of getting all the
 
05:48:21.150 --> 05:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
interventions at the hospital I knew
 
05:48:23.030 --> 05:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
that he would be healthy and thankfully
 
05:48:24.150 --> 05:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's what happened but if something
 
05:48:26.390 --> 05:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
had happened that would have been on me
 
05:48:29.910 --> 05:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
please wrap up yes if if the committee
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
is willing and maybe the Midwife uh
 
05:48:34.150 --> 05:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
counsel or other people would help would
 
05:48:36.868 --> 05:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
could we amend this bill to take the
 
05:48:38.628 --> 05:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
what I believe to be the lowest risk
 
05:48:40.030 --> 05:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
which is a vaginal birth after two
 
05:48:42.628 --> 05:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
cesarians and um you know amend it down
 
05:48:44.190 --> 05:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
to that maybe but there are women who
 
05:48:47.030 --> 05:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
will choose to give birth alone who
 
05:48:48.910 --> 05:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
won't has a good outcome as I had
 
05:48:51.270 --> 05:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps if we don't allow more access to
 
05:48:53.948 --> 05:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
midw free care across the state thank
 
05:48:57.070 --> 05:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
05:49:03.750 --> 05:49:03.760 align:start position:0%

05:50:18.310 --> 05:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
delivery of a pregnant mother with
 
05:50:20.430 --> 05:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
high-risk concerns of malpresentation or
 
05:50:23.350 --> 05:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
breach multifetal or twin presentation
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
gestations and a trial of labor after
 
05:50:28.190 --> 05:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
three cesarian sections to be undertaken
 
05:50:29.830 --> 05:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
at a should be undertaken at a hospital
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
setting I wholeheartedly agree with
 
05:50:34.190 --> 05:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
these statements I would like to offer
 
05:50:36.868 --> 05:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
another view of this matter there's
 
05:50:38.628 --> 05:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
already a rift in some areas between the
 
05:50:40.830 --> 05:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
community midwives and Physicians some
 
05:50:42.590 --> 05:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
Community midwives and their patients
 
05:50:44.230 --> 05:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
have a distrust in the formal medical
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
system feeling that many interventions
 
05:50:48.990 --> 05:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
are unwarranted or
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary some hospital-based
 
05:50:52.468 --> 05:50:52.478 align:start position:0%
providers have been on the receiving end
 
05:50:54.270 --> 05:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
of Out of Hospital births gone wrong
 
05:50:56.590 --> 05:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
only to find that the time to safely
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
intervene had passed sometimes resulting
 
05:51:01.750 --> 05:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
in a damaged baby or worse and other
 
05:51:03.350 --> 05:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
times mothers and fathers with emotional
 
05:51:04.948 --> 05:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
scars that will last a
 
05:51:06.910 --> 05:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
lifetime passing this bill would allow
 
05:51:08.990 --> 05:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
community- based midwives to care for
 
05:51:10.830 --> 05:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
patients with extremely high risks to
 
05:51:12.390 --> 05:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
mother and baby outside of the safety
 
05:51:14.910 --> 05:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
net of a hospital this will lead to more
 
05:51:16.990 --> 05:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
intrapartum emergencies and transfers to
 
05:51:18.548 --> 05:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
facilities where there might already be
 
05:51:21.590 --> 05:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
a bias against the outof hospital birth
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
population this would further tarnish
 
05:51:24.830 --> 05:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
the relationship between the community
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
midwives and the OB units where they
 
05:51:29.708 --> 05:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
present when they present only when
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
things have gone wrong it would
 
05:51:32.910 --> 05:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
undermine the trust that is developed in
 
05:51:34.910 --> 05:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
many communities amongst the community
 
05:51:36.590 --> 05:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
midwives and their local OB providers
 
05:51:36.600 --> 05:51:38.788 align:start position:0%
midwives and their local OB providers
and

05:51:38.788 --> 05:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals why should we knowingly allow
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
some of the most high-risk issues In
 
05:51:44.548 --> 05:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
Obstetrics to be cared for without a
 
05:51:47.788 --> 05:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
safety net as a practicing OBGYN each of
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
these conditions warrants a hospital
 
05:51:51.788 --> 05:51:51.798 align:start position:0%
care and continuous monitoring of the
 
05:51:53.590 --> 05:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
baby and mother to ensure a safe birth
 
05:51:56.270 --> 05:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
process which is what we all want to do
 
05:51:57.670 --> 05:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
anything different would be negligent on
 
05:51:59.708 --> 05:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
the part of those facilitated
 
05:52:03.230 --> 05:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
it perhaps an analogy might make it
 
05:52:05.430 --> 05:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
clear we can agree that a baby is
 
05:52:07.270 --> 05:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps anyone's most precious belonging
 
05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
or commodity parents would step in front
 
05:52:12.350 --> 05:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
of bullets or Bears or buses to prevent
 
05:52:14.830 --> 05:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
from any harm occurring to their baby or
 
05:52:17.070 --> 05:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
child just as most car rides are
 
05:52:19.350 --> 05:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
uneventful and end with a safe arrival I
 
05:52:20.990 --> 05:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the majority of lowrisk
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
births can be similarly accomplished
 
05:52:25.468 --> 05:52:25.478 align:start position:0%
safely with good labor support and
 
05:52:28.350 --> 05:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
without extra or undue medical attention
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
yet we still put our babies in car seats
 
05:52:33.548 --> 05:52:33.558 align:start position:0%
to get them for point A to point B not
 
05:52:35.390 --> 05:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
because we're expecting a car accident
 
05:52:36.708 --> 05:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
but so our child can be safe in the
 
05:52:39.548 --> 05:52:39.558 align:start position:0%
event of one then add a snowstorm like
 
05:52:42.110 --> 05:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
the one we had last week you better
 
05:52:43.590 --> 05:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
believe that most parents would not go
 
05:52:45.310 --> 05:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
out in that storm but if it were
 
05:52:46.670 --> 05:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary they would make
 
05:52:48.468 --> 05:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
sure their baby was strapped tightly and
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
securely in that car seat just in case
 
05:52:53.468 --> 05:52:53.478 align:start position:0%
please start wrapping up allowing out of
 
05:52:54.868 --> 05:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
the hospital birth attempts have breach
 
05:52:56.788 --> 05:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
babies twin pregnancies and vaginal
 
05:52:58.430 --> 05:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
deliveries after multiple C-section
 
05:53:00.150 --> 05:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
without the safety net of the hospital
 
05:53:02.270 --> 05:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
and all it can provide is an eem in an
 
05:53:04.030 --> 05:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
emergency it's like driving your baby
 
05:53:06.310 --> 05:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
out in a snowstorm without a car seat it
 
05:53:08.868 --> 05:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
would be negligent to do so House Bill
 
05:53:11.548 --> 05:53:11.558 align:start position:0%
101 goes against all that we do to keep
 
05:53:13.150 --> 05:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
mothers and babies safe during the labor
 
05:53:15.390 --> 05:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
process in our state I'm adamantly
 
05:53:19.468 --> 05:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
opposed to this thank you thank you any
 
05:53:24.510 --> 05:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.708 --> 05:53:27.718 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Dr Emy

Lee representing
 
05:53:34.430 --> 05:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:36.990 --> 05:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
minutes hi my name is Amy Lee I'm a New
 
05:53:38.670 --> 05:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident and also a resident
 
05:53:40.948 --> 05:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
OBGYN physician I'm additionally
 
05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
05:53:44.548 --> 05:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
Medical Society as
 
05:53:48.070 --> 05:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
well I'm here today to oppose
 
05:53:50.230 --> 05:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
hb1010 I want to disclose that this
 
05:53:52.110 --> 05:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
testimony contains content that may be
 
05:53:54.430 --> 05:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
triggering to survivors of birth
 
05:53:56.708 --> 05:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
trauma New Hampshire's a relatively
 
05:53:58.628 --> 05:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
rural state with expanding maternity
 
05:54:01.750 --> 05:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
care deserts a major factor influencing
 
05:54:03.788 --> 05:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
the safety of a pled home birth is the
 
05:54:06.310 --> 05:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
availability of Safe And Timely transfer
 
05:54:08.070 --> 05:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
during labor or
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
postpartum the reported risk of needing
 
05:54:12.590 --> 05:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
transport to a hospital during labor is
 
05:54:16.670 --> 05:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
up to 37% for firsttime moms and 10% for
 
05:54:18.430 --> 05:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
women who have had babies
 
05:54:20.910 --> 05:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
before in areas like New Hampshire
 
05:54:22.750 --> 05:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
without a health system built for home
 
05:54:24.830 --> 05:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
births and where the Receiving Hospital
 
05:54:27.150 --> 05:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
may be remote there is the potential for
 
05:54:29.350 --> 05:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
delayed or prolonged transport during
 
05:54:32.150 --> 05:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
labor postpartum this will ultimately
 
05:54:34.390 --> 05:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
result in higher rates of death for
 
05:54:35.590 --> 05:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
mothers and
 
05:54:37.670 --> 05:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
infants now let's add the highrisk
 
05:54:40.190 --> 05:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
scenarios of long-distance travel while
 
05:54:43.510 --> 05:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
in labor postpartum to hb1010
 
05:54:46.070 --> 05:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
scenarios I'll illustrate some scenarios
 
05:54:48.750 --> 05:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
that can and will happen if hb1010 goes
 
05:54:48.760 --> 05:54:49.788 align:start position:0%
that can and will happen if hb1010 goes
into

05:54:49.788 --> 05:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:54:52.390 --> 05:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
effect imagine a baby is being born
 
05:54:55.510 --> 05:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
breach meaning feet or butt first the
 
05:54:57.468 --> 05:54:57.478 align:start position:0%
head is the biggest part that must pass
 
05:54:59.628 --> 05:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
through the Eternal bony pelvis which
 
05:55:02.670 --> 05:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
means the space between the hips let's
 
05:55:05.628 --> 05:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
say the body comes out but the head gets
 
05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
caught what happens is that the
 
05:55:10.110 --> 05:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
umbilical cord gets compressed between
 
05:55:12.230 --> 05:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
the infant's head and the maternal bony
 
05:55:15.030 --> 05:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
pelvis cutting off the infant's oxygen
 
05:55:17.548 --> 05:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
supply the infant
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
asphyxiates the mother then needs to be
 
05:55:22.030 --> 05:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
transported potentially hours with her
 
05:55:24.510 --> 05:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
dead infant half
 
05:55:26.750 --> 05:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
delivered if the patient were in the
 
05:55:28.750 --> 05:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
hospital or very close
 
05:55:30.708 --> 05:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
forceps or a cesarian could have
 
05:55:33.150 --> 05:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
urgently been performed to potentially
 
05:55:34.390 --> 05:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
save this
 
05:55:37.230 --> 05:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
baby twins carry a higher risk for
 
05:55:39.390 --> 05:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
breach presentation and are therefore at
 
05:55:41.948 --> 05:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
risk for what I just described what is
 
05:55:43.948 --> 05:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
also concerning about twins is that they
 
05:55:46.350 --> 05:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
have an 18-fold higher risk of
 
05:55:49.310 --> 05:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
postpartum Hemorrhage than single infant
 
05:55:52.350 --> 05:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
births Hemorrhage can happen in minutes
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
patients experiencing postpartum
 
05:55:56.270 --> 05:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hemorrhage require medications pressure
 
05:55:59.948 --> 05:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
induction devices and even rarely H
 
05:56:02.070 --> 05:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
hysterectomies many need intravenous
 
05:56:04.110 --> 05:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
fluids and blood transfusions to keep
 
05:56:06.310 --> 05:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
them stable until the bleeding can be
 
05:56:09.030 --> 05:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
stopped these resources are simply not
 
05:56:11.270 --> 05:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
available at home births and a patient
 
05:56:13.548 --> 05:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
could easily bleed to death over long
 
05:56:13.558 --> 05:56:14.750 align:start position:0%
could easily bleed to death over long
transport

05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
transport
 
05:56:17.150 --> 05:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
distances it is not hard to imagine a
 
05:56:18.868 --> 05:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
scenario where an ambulance arrives
 
05:56:21.708 --> 05:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
saturated in blood with a dead
 
05:56:24.270 --> 05:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
mother I understand the sponsor's goals
 
05:56:26.310 --> 05:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
to improve access to Midwife care for
 
05:56:28.030 --> 05:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
patients throughout the state but but
 
05:56:30.548 --> 05:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
hb1010 is not the
 
05:56:33.830 --> 05:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
way enacting the spill and disregarding
 
05:56:35.708 --> 05:56:35.718 align:start position:0%
the reality of Health Systems in New
 
05:56:38.230 --> 05:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will result in maternal and
 
05:56:38.240 --> 05:56:39.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will result in maternal and
infant

05:56:39.990 --> 05:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
infant
 
05:56:42.350 --> 05:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
deaths for these reasons I urge the
 
05:56:47.190 --> 05:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend itl for
 
05:56:50.788 --> 05:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
hb1010 okay perfect timing the minutes
 
05:56:53.788 --> 05:56:53.798 align:start position:0%
just ended any questions representative
 
05:56:55.948 --> 05:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr
 
05:56:59.590 --> 05:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm sort of torn somewhat if I
 
05:57:02.110 --> 05:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
understand the issue of free birthing
 
05:57:04.468 --> 05:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
and that seems to be something that
 
05:57:07.468 --> 05:57:07.478 align:start position:0%
women want to gravitate towards that in
 
05:57:09.750 --> 05:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
itself has a set of risk associated with
 
05:57:12.868 --> 05:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
it balancing that with ones that have
 
05:57:16.110 --> 05:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
access to a nurse Midwife which also has
 
05:57:18.788 --> 05:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
risk associated with it I'm trying to
 
05:57:21.868 --> 05:57:21.878 align:start position:0%
figure out how do we somehow ensure that
 
05:57:24.150 --> 05:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
those who want free birthing have some
 
05:57:26.750 --> 05:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
access some care and not something all
 
05:57:28.390 --> 05:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
of a sudden it's done at the very last
 
05:57:30.788 --> 05:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
minute through an amess ride which may
 
05:57:33.230 --> 05:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
not be called for so how do we somehow
 
05:57:36.110 --> 05:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
balance the two ends yeah that's a good
 
05:57:38.750 --> 05:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
question there are other places in the
 
05:57:41.350 --> 05:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
world and even other states that have
 
05:57:44.350 --> 05:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
very Integrated Health Systems meaning
 
05:57:46.510 --> 05:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
that they have rules and regulations set
 
05:57:49.750 --> 05:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
up with specific criteria for when to
 
05:57:53.590 --> 05:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
transfer during labor or postpartum to a
 
05:57:55.830 --> 05:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
facility and many of those facilities
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
are within close distance when example
 
05:58:01.510 --> 05:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
is in Washington state they do home
 
05:58:03.270 --> 05:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
births of low risk I'm not talking about
 
05:58:06.390 --> 05:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
these high-risk scenarios but they do
 
05:58:09.830 --> 05:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
home more home births there but the
 
05:58:11.628 --> 05:58:11.638 align:start position:0%
average distance from the hospital there
 
05:58:15.350 --> 05:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:18.430 --> 05:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
miles and in terms I would say in terms
 
05:58:20.788 --> 05:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
of the people who want free birth I'm
 
05:58:24.430 --> 05:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
not sure this bill is going to find
 
05:58:26.510 --> 05:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
providers out there who are willing to
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
take on all these highrisk scenar I I
 
05:58:30.110 --> 05:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't think it will address the problem
 
05:58:31.868 --> 05:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
of people wanting to do home free births
 
05:58:33.350 --> 05:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
I think there's other ways to do that
 
05:58:36.070 --> 05:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
and I think um people have spoken before
 
05:58:38.070 --> 05:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
have brought up great points including
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
like let's have a conversation on how we
 
05:58:42.150 --> 05:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
can do more breach deliveries but this
 
05:58:45.708 --> 05:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
is not the way you have a followup I
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
think you've answered the question I'm
 
05:58:49.070 --> 05:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
trying to again balance the free
 
05:58:51.468 --> 05:58:51.478 align:start position:0%
birthing movement if you will and their
 
05:58:54.230 --> 05:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
rights to do free birthing but still
 
05:58:56.830 --> 05:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
have access somewhat to some medical
 
05:58:58.990 --> 05:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
care if they elect to do that and that's
 
05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm not sure where to go with it
 
05:59:03.070 --> 05:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
but thank you for what you what you
 
05:59:04.910 --> 05:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
provided to me I can look at what's
 
05:59:05.948 --> 05:59:05.958 align:start position:0%
going on in Washington some of the
 
05:59:08.230 --> 05:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
integrated care because there are two
 
05:59:12.070 --> 05:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
sets of um risk factors in either
 
05:59:14.230 --> 05:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
scenario other
 
05:59:16.270 --> 05:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
05:59:16.280 --> 05:59:19.948 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
thank

05:59:19.948 --> 05:59:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:22.310 --> 05:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
05:59:24.150 --> 05:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
05:59:26.468 --> 05:59:26.478 align:start position:0%
Penza representative Penza you've asked
 
05:59:34.910 --> 05:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:36.628 --> 05:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of this bill because
 
05:59:40.270 --> 05:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I support I support choice and it's
 
05:59:44.590 --> 05:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
been um my oldest is 17 since uh I had
 
05:59:46.270 --> 05:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
them and I had them in a hospital but
 
05:59:48.430 --> 05:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to use my personal
 
05:59:50.948 --> 05:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
experience so I come from a family of
 
05:59:54.830 --> 05:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
big babies and um so I was 10 and a half
 
05:59:58.110 --> 05:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
pounds my brother was almost 11 and so
 
05:59:59.868 --> 05:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
they said I was going to have big babies
 
06:00:02.350 --> 06:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
and they um wanted to schedule me a
 
06:00:04.350 --> 06:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
C-section and all of those types of
 
06:00:09.548 --> 06:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
things the pushing level of of surgical
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
procedures is huge and I could give a
 
06:00:12.638 --> 06:00:13.430 align:start position:0%
procedures is huge and I could give a
hundred

06:00:13.430 --> 06:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
stories of fellow mom friends that were
 
06:00:17.310 --> 06:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
in those same
 
06:00:20.390 --> 06:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
situations and so I'm sure that the you
 
06:00:22.670 --> 06:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
know maybe this bill would be amended I
 
06:00:25.310 --> 06:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
just believe that that it shouldn't be a
 
06:00:27.548 --> 06:00:27.558 align:start position:0%
disqualifying Factor just because
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
because a you know a mom had a C-section
 
06:00:33.548 --> 06:00:33.558 align:start position:0%
or two a lot of these people were pushed
 
06:00:35.670 --> 06:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
into having them one they make a lot
 
06:00:39.510 --> 06:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
more money than having it just be you
 
06:00:41.590 --> 06:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
know in a hospital we know that for a
 
06:00:45.390 --> 06:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
fact and I just my personal experience
 
06:00:49.390 --> 06:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
is having that level of choice so I I
 
06:00:52.030 --> 06:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
would hope that there would be uh you
 
06:00:54.430 --> 06:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
know something that comes forward to to
 
06:00:56.910 --> 06:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
support this effort um I think there was
 
06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of stat Ms that were said that are
 
06:01:01.350 --> 06:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
just not true in regards with Midwifery
 
06:01:03.270 --> 06:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
and and things like that it's one of the
 
06:01:06.548 --> 06:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
oldest professions um on the on the
 
06:01:09.628 --> 06:01:09.638 align:start position:0%
planet so before we had hospitals and
 
06:01:13.310 --> 06:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
all these big huge fancy um things
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
babies have been delivered in homes
 
06:01:17.350 --> 06:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
which are different than free births
 
06:01:18.708 --> 06:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
home births have been happening for a
 
06:01:21.590 --> 06:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
long time for you know hundreds of years
 
06:01:25.310 --> 06:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
so one of the doctors that spoke here uh
 
06:01:27.708 --> 06:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
I saw for about four years and he used
 
06:01:30.670 --> 06:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
to wear a button that said I trust women
 
06:01:33.430 --> 06:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to trust women thank
 
06:01:36.868 --> 06:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you any
 
06:01:41.830 --> 06:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:44.750 --> 06:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Dr
 
06:01:48.350 --> 06:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
Cecilia Clemens representing
 
06:01:50.830 --> 06:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
herself and you've asked a little over
 
06:01:52.030 --> 06:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
three minutes the closer to three
 
06:01:55.948 --> 06:01:55.958 align:start position:0%
minutes you can make it the better thank
 
06:01:58.430 --> 06:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon
 
06:02:00.430 --> 06:02:00.440 align:start position:0%

06:02:08.310 --> 06:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
section chief of OBGYN at Catholic
 
06:02:10.670 --> 06:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
Medical Center I've been delivering
 
06:02:12.030 --> 06:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
babies in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:02:12.040 --> 06:02:13.708 align:start position:0%
babies in the state of New Hampshire
since

06:02:13.708 --> 06:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
since
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
1997 I've worked with midm midwives my
 
06:02:19.230 --> 06:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
entire career I collaborate with
 
06:02:20.910 --> 06:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
midwives both in the hospital setting
 
06:02:22.948 --> 06:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
and when accepting transfers from out of
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
Hospital midwives who are attempting out
 
06:02:27.350 --> 06:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
of Hospital births I deeply respect
 
06:02:29.390 --> 06:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
respect their practice and value the
 
06:02:31.750 --> 06:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
Midwife physician collaboration to
 
06:02:33.468 --> 06:02:33.478 align:start position:0%
provide the best Maternal Fetal and
 
06:02:33.478 --> 06:02:34.868 align:start position:0%
provide the best Maternal Fetal and
neonatal

06:02:34.868 --> 06:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
neonatal
 
06:02:37.788 --> 06:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
outcomes I am a proponent of vaginal
 
06:02:40.230 --> 06:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
birth including for those women with
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
twin gestations
 
06:02:43.868 --> 06:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
malpresentation and those who have
 
06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
undergone multiple prior cesarian births
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
I disagree with previous testimony that
 
06:02:51.750 --> 06:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire does not
 
06:02:53.628 --> 06:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
allow hospitals in the state of New
 
06:02:55.910 --> 06:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do not allow C SEC vaginal
 
06:02:59.270 --> 06:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
bursts after two three C sections come
 
06:02:59.280 --> 06:02:59.948 align:start position:0%
bursts after two three C sections come
to

06:02:59.948 --> 06:02:59.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:03:04.310 --> 06:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
CMC I disagree that vaginal breaches are
 
06:03:08.110 --> 06:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
not allowed come to CMC I teach them we
 
06:03:10.788 --> 06:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
do them and people who have sat in this
 
06:03:12.390 --> 06:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
chair saying that they are not allowed
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire are wrong
 
06:03:16.750 --> 06:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking today in opposition of
 
06:03:17.830 --> 06:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:03:19.948 --> 06:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
1010 the American College of nurse
 
06:03:21.430 --> 06:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
midwives states that midwives must
 
06:03:23.310 --> 06:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
provide complete accurate and accessible
 
06:03:24.750 --> 06:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
information for patients to make
 
06:03:26.868 --> 06:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
informed Healthcare decisions patients
 
06:03:28.548 --> 06:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
who desire ire home birth should review
 
06:03:30.430 --> 06:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
evidence-based information on its risks
 
06:03:33.030 --> 06:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
and benefits from their Midwife patients
 
06:03:34.510 --> 06:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
should be informed that although planned
 
06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
home birth is associated with fewer
 
06:03:38.070 --> 06:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
maternal interventions than planned
 
06:03:40.910 --> 06:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital birth it is also associated
 
06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
with a more than two-fold increased risk
 
06:03:45.350 --> 06:03:45.360 align:start position:0%

was associated with an intrapartum fetal

highlights the home labor after cesarian
 
06:04:08.390 --> 06:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
would increase neonatal morbidity in the
 
06:04:10.430 --> 06:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire why would the
 
06:04:12.468 --> 06:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
legislature want to create a policy that
 
06:04:15.468 --> 06:04:15.478 align:start position:0%
increases infant deaths in New Hampshire
 
06:04:16.948 --> 06:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
while a woman who has had a prior
 
06:04:18.548 --> 06:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
cesarian delivery is not a good

candidate for home bursts other
 
06:04:22.990 --> 06:04:23.000 align:start position:0%

06:04:51.628 --> 06:04:51.638 align:start position:0%
summarize based on population data and

multiple gestation prior ceran delivery
 
06:05:00.590 --> 06:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
are all absolute contraindications to
 
06:05:03.990 --> 06:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
home birth House Bill 1010 explicitly
 
06:05:06.390 --> 06:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
rejects Decades of evidence based
 
06:05:08.590 --> 06:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
research and dismisses the governing
 
06:05:10.910 --> 06:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
body from Eternal safety in the United
 
06:05:13.150 --> 06:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
States of America when it proclaims that
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
there shall be no rules limiting Care by
 
06:05:17.868 --> 06:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
a midwife for women with these
 
06:05:20.548 --> 06:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
conditions I have personally been
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
involved up pleas multiple examples of
 
06:05:25.070 --> 06:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
Hospital transfers for women who have
 
06:05:27.628 --> 06:05:27.638 align:start position:0%
attempted an out of Hospital birth these
 
06:05:29.350 --> 06:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
examples unfortunately have concluded
 
06:05:32.190 --> 06:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
with neonatal transfers to tertiary care
 
06:05:34.030 --> 06:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
centers with separation of moms and
 
06:05:36.990 --> 06:05:37.000 align:start position:0%

maternal hemorrhages due to uterine
 
06:05:41.110 --> 06:05:41.120 align:start position:0%

06:05:43.390 --> 06:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
insignificant birth trauma for mothers
 
06:05:45.708 --> 06:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
after their emergent unexpected and
 
06:05:48.310 --> 06:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
unprepared transfers to the hospital
 
06:05:50.590 --> 06:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
every word of House Bill 1010 rejects
 
06:05:52.510 --> 06:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
safety and will increase the deaths of
 
06:05:54.628 --> 06:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
moms and infants in New Hampshire this
 
06:05:57.230 --> 06:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill is terrifying and should be opposed
 
06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions
 
06:06:00.230 --> 06:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
 
06:06:03.270 --> 06:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative tez thank you Mr chairman
 
06:06:05.788 --> 06:06:05.798 align:start position:0%
um you said that you were a supporter of
 
06:06:09.468 --> 06:06:09.478 align:start position:0%
midwives and um and of patients having
 
06:06:11.670 --> 06:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
choice so let's say there was somebody
 
06:06:13.390 --> 06:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
who had a
 
06:06:15.390 --> 06:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
certified what is it a certified
 
06:06:18.310 --> 06:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
professional Midwife and they had formed
 
06:06:20.628 --> 06:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
a trusting relationship with them and
 
06:06:23.990 --> 06:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
then sometime in the third trimester um
 
06:06:26.430 --> 06:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
a high-risk situation emerged and either
 
06:06:28.708 --> 06:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
because the laws that stands or because
 
06:06:33.190 --> 06:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
the Judgment of the um of the soon to be
 
06:06:35.670 --> 06:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
mother and the Midwife they decided to
 
06:06:38.430 --> 06:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
transfer their care to a hospital to you
 
06:06:41.670 --> 06:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
um so to what in that case what to what
 
06:06:43.948 --> 06:06:43.958 align:start position:0%
extent would
 
06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
the Midwife who had a a good
 
06:06:51.110 --> 06:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
relationship with the mom to be to what
 
06:06:53.310 --> 06:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
extent would they be welcomed into the
 
06:06:56.030 --> 06:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
hospital process would they you know in
 
06:06:58.468 --> 06:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
what to what ENT and in what Manner
 
06:07:00.548 --> 06:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
might they be able to be involved in the
 
06:07:02.670 --> 06:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
birth in the hospital that's a great
 
06:07:05.230 --> 06:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
question I take phone calls very
 
06:07:07.868 --> 06:07:07.878 align:start position:0%
frequently at on call at the hospital
 
06:07:10.670 --> 06:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
from out of hos out of Hospital midwives
 
06:07:13.548 --> 06:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
who are asking to transfer patients to
 
06:07:15.868 --> 06:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
the hospital sometimes they call
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't call I always
 
06:07:20.230 --> 06:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
encourage them in that discussion to
 
06:07:23.430 --> 06:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
present with the patient for a a a
 
06:07:26.990 --> 06:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
personto person handoff I always uh
 
06:07:29.390 --> 06:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
invite them to stay and act as a support
 
06:07:31.948 --> 06:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
person in a hospital obviously an out of
 
06:07:34.190 --> 06:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
Hospital Midwife does not have hospital
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
privileges and can't act as a clinician
 
06:07:39.310 --> 06:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
but they are more than encouraged to
 
06:07:42.150 --> 06:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
stay and and bridge that relationship
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
with the hospital setting and and um and
 
06:07:47.390 --> 06:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
and the person that they've been caring
 
06:07:52.788 --> 06:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
for I absolutely am 100% uh a advocate
 
06:07:55.830 --> 06:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
for um midwives staying
 
06:07:58.628 --> 06:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
involved representative TZ and then
 
06:07:58.638 --> 06:08:00.750 align:start position:0%
involved representative TZ and then
representative

06:08:00.750 --> 06:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:08:05.590 --> 06:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
Weber uh thank you uh Mr chairman and um
 
06:08:07.590 --> 06:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Clemens for taking my
 
06:08:11.830 --> 06:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
question so uh prior
 
06:08:15.788 --> 06:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
uh speakers have reminded us that for
 
06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
Millennia women have been giving birth
 
06:08:21.390 --> 06:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
at home so I was wondering and thank you
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
for explaining that it's and other
 
06:08:25.670 --> 06:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
people also explaining it's less about
 
06:08:27.310 --> 06:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
the role and it's more about about the
 
06:08:30.468 --> 06:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
setting um that that that is really
 
06:08:33.070 --> 06:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
important so can you can you remind us
 
06:08:35.110 --> 06:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
or paint a picture of what the birth
 
06:08:38.110 --> 06:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
outcomes were like historically versus
 
06:08:40.990 --> 06:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
current day because none of us were
 
06:08:42.910 --> 06:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
alive and we don't really
 
06:08:45.868 --> 06:08:45.878 align:start position:0%
remember how much you know how many
 
06:08:48.670 --> 06:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
women died how many babies died you know
 
06:08:50.310 --> 06:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
what these these outcomes that happened
 
06:08:53.670 --> 06:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
all the time that were considered the
 
06:08:56.070 --> 06:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
norm that are very different from what
 
06:08:59.430 --> 06:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
now you you know I I don't think I am
 
06:09:06.468 --> 06:09:06.478 align:start position:0%
saying something that is unknown to to
 
06:09:08.990 --> 06:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
this committee that
 
06:09:12.230 --> 06:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
the Maternal Fetal outcomes in the
 
06:09:14.990 --> 06:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
United States of America is almost at
 
06:09:16.868 --> 06:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the of the
 
06:09:20.310 --> 06:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
list um to answer your question what's
 
06:09:22.670 --> 06:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
what's different in all of a millennia
 
06:09:28.430 --> 06:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
is that we were in a a developing
 
06:09:32.948 --> 06:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
country we had to accept a perinatal
 
06:09:34.670 --> 06:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
mortality of
 
06:09:37.910 --> 06:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
152% that is no longer acceptable in the
 
06:09:37.920 --> 06:09:38.990 align:start position:0%
152% that is no longer acceptable in the
United

06:09:38.990 --> 06:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
United
 
06:09:41.708 --> 06:09:41.718 align:start position:0%
States how can we how can we as a
 
06:09:46.830 --> 06:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
country say that it is okay
 
06:09:52.670 --> 06:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
for us to make rules that increase risk
 
06:09:55.628 --> 06:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:00.628 --> 06:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
babies and correct we we haven't always
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
we they've been delivering out of
 
06:10:03.468 --> 06:10:03.478 align:start position:0%
hospitals for
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
Millennia correct we'
 
06:10:09.830 --> 06:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
also hopefully have decreased the
 
06:10:13.708 --> 06:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
maternal and Fetal and neonatal
 
06:10:17.750 --> 06:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:22.230 --> 06:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:24.430 --> 06:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and thank you for taking
 
06:10:27.230 --> 06:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
my question uh I think our mind is a
 
06:10:30.948 --> 06:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
followup perhaps to representative
 
06:10:37.310 --> 06:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
Shapiro um you stated that a mid a
 
06:10:39.510 --> 06:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
certified professional Midwife coming
 
06:10:41.948 --> 06:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
into the hospital with a patient would
 
06:10:43.788 --> 06:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
not have hospital privileges and
 
06:10:45.510 --> 06:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
therefore would be a support person but
 
06:10:49.670 --> 06:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
not a clinician so my question is do you
 
06:10:51.910 --> 06:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
have in your practice certified
 
06:10:53.830 --> 06:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
professional midwives or do you have
 
06:10:57.868 --> 06:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
only nurse midwives and as a hospital
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
practice Y in our hospital we have
 
06:11:01.070 --> 06:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
certified nurse midwives who are
 
06:11:03.510 --> 06:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
advanced practice providers who master's
 
06:11:05.670 --> 06:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
degrees nursing degrees and master's
 
06:11:09.390 --> 06:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
degrees so you don't have Affiliated um
 
06:11:13.190 --> 06:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
certified professional M cor thank you
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative McLean yeah thank you Mr
 
06:11:17.510 --> 06:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:11:21.390 --> 06:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
so um whenever you're working with a
 
06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
patient you know we hear from all the
 
06:11:24.468 --> 06:11:24.478 align:start position:0%
different doctors who testified you know
 
06:11:26.788 --> 06:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
we make our recommendations and as a
 
06:11:29.310 --> 06:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
doctor you you can recommend but you
 
06:11:29.320 --> 06:11:30.430 align:start position:0%
doctor you you can recommend but you
can't

06:11:30.430 --> 06:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
can't
 
06:11:34.270 --> 06:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
command and so there are going to be
 
06:11:36.990 --> 06:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
some women who are going to you know in
 
06:11:39.868 --> 06:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
spite of your counsel they're going to
 
06:11:42.030 --> 06:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
kind of choose their own path and maybe
 
06:11:45.230 --> 06:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
that involves a home birth um and so
 
06:11:47.110 --> 06:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
kind of the testimony that I'm hearing
 
06:11:50.230 --> 06:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
it almost sounds like these women are
 
06:11:53.070 --> 06:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
kind of cut loose so and there's there's
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
no real place it's it's either you're
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
all in or you're all out kind of thing
 
06:11:59.910 --> 06:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
and that kind of following on some are
 
06:12:02.310 --> 06:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants concern so if
 
06:12:04.030 --> 06:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at this bill is there
 
06:12:06.628 --> 06:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
anything about this bill that you would
 
06:12:08.670 --> 06:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
maybe Salvage to give these women a
 
06:12:11.030 --> 06:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
softer place to land or anything else
 
06:12:13.030 --> 06:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
that you would maybe recommend well I
 
06:12:15.030 --> 06:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
mean I agree with the ongoing need for
 
06:12:17.750 --> 06:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
discussion and I I agree with your
 
06:12:19.990 --> 06:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
initial statement that you know it is
 
06:12:22.990 --> 06:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
our job as as as as Physicians and
 
06:12:25.670 --> 06:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
providers of of women's health is to
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
give information and women absolutely
 
06:12:30.350 --> 06:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
are able to make their own
 
06:12:33.510 --> 06:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
decisions and I work in a practice where
 
06:12:36.230 --> 06:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
I have women come after four C-sections
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
three C-sections breach Mal PR you know
 
06:12:42.110 --> 06:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
everything that we're talking about
 
06:12:47.190 --> 06:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
today and try to have a risk benefit
 
06:12:49.990 --> 06:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
discussion providing patient autonomy
 
06:12:51.788 --> 06:12:51.798 align:start position:0%
they get to take the information that I
 
06:12:53.830 --> 06:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
give them and make a decision and when
 
06:12:56.430 --> 06:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
they make that decision it is my job to
 
06:12:58.310 --> 06:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
support them in that decision and even
 
06:12:59.788 --> 06:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
if it's not something that I would
 
06:13:01.468 --> 06:13:01.478 align:start position:0%
personally choose
 
06:13:04.150 --> 06:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
myself I am the physician that will
 
06:13:06.110 --> 06:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
support them and my staff will support
 
06:13:08.468 --> 06:13:08.478 align:start position:0%
them so I recently delivered someone who
 
06:13:10.948 --> 06:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
had had four previous cesarian sections
 
06:13:13.830 --> 06:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
who did not want repeat she came from a
 
06:13:13.840 --> 06:13:14.868 align:start position:0%
who did not want repeat she came from a
home

06:13:14.868 --> 06:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
home
 
06:13:18.150 --> 06:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
Midwife and she
 
06:13:22.070 --> 06:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
attempted a vaginal birth it we
 
06:13:25.830 --> 06:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
supported her through that process and
 
06:13:27.830 --> 06:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately she required a C-section
 
06:13:30.430 --> 06:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately she asked for a C-section she
 
06:13:32.110 --> 06:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
was in the supportive environment I
 
06:13:33.788 --> 06:13:33.798 align:start position:0%
think that what we're talking about
 
06:13:35.868 --> 06:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill as it stands
 
06:13:37.708 --> 06:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
to answer your question that I support
 
06:13:39.510 --> 06:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
but I believe that there needs to be
 
06:13:41.670 --> 06:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussion there needs to be
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
ongoing education with our public to
 
06:13:46.868 --> 06:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
understand that women do have options
 
06:13:48.830 --> 06:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
they can come to hospitals and be cared
 
06:13:51.750 --> 06:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
for by midwives in a and and have that
 
06:13:51.760 --> 06:13:55.270 align:start position:0%
for by midwives in a and and have that
safety

06:13:55.270 --> 06:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
net any other
 
06:14:01.190 --> 06:14:01.200 align:start position:0%

minutes good afternoon committee chair

and the director of the midwif re
 
06:14:28.430 --> 06:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
service at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical
 
06:14:30.990 --> 06:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
Center I've been practicing as a
 
06:14:33.670 --> 06:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
certified nurse Midwife since 2014
 
06:14:35.468 --> 06:14:35.478 align:start position:0%
during my career I've attended births
 
06:14:37.390 --> 06:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
both in the hospital sending and at a
 
06:14:39.468 --> 06:14:39.478 align:start position:0%
birth center located outside of the
 
06:14:41.708 --> 06:14:41.718 align:start position:0%
hospital I'm here to speak in opposition
 
06:14:44.350 --> 06:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 1010 I'm concerned this
 
06:14:46.030 --> 06:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
bill will put birthing people their
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
babies and The Midwives who care for
 
06:14:50.110 --> 06:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
them at risk this bill under undermines
 
06:14:52.230 --> 06:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
and compromises my own my own
 
06:14:54.230 --> 06:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
profession's ability to uphold the
 
06:14:56.310 --> 06:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
quality and safety of the care we
 
06:14:58.590 --> 06:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
provide us midwives and it undermines
 
06:15:00.510 --> 06:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Midwifery Council and
 
06:15:02.270 --> 06:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
established Midwifery certifying
 
06:15:04.110 --> 06:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
organizations who set our standards of
 
06:15:07.468 --> 06:15:07.478 align:start position:0%
practice based on expertise and data
 
06:15:09.030 --> 06:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
this bill goes against expert
 
06:15:11.070 --> 06:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
practitioners advice on who is a good
 
06:15:13.590 --> 06:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
candidate for home birth while I'm a
 
06:15:15.110 --> 06:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
certified nurse Midwife and therefore
 
06:15:17.670 --> 06:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
not regulated by the Midwifery Council I
 
06:15:19.708 --> 06:15:19.718 align:start position:0%
share much of the same philosophy
 
06:15:21.910 --> 06:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
training and fundamentals of approach as
 
06:15:24.270 --> 06:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
certified midwives and have deep respect
 
06:15:27.110 --> 06:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
for them as a midwife I strongly believe
 
06:15:29.390 --> 06:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
in the process of normal birth I
 
06:15:31.590 --> 06:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
strongly support support reducing
 
06:15:33.788 --> 06:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
barriers to accessing Midwifery care
 
06:15:36.190 --> 06:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
including access to nurse midwives and
 
06:15:38.110 --> 06:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
certified professional midwives
 
06:15:39.670 --> 06:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
including things like improving
 
06:15:41.548 --> 06:15:41.558 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage and financial support
 
06:15:43.910 --> 06:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
for Midwifery Services increasing
 
06:15:46.548 --> 06:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
programs that educate and train midwives
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
I also believe that home birth is a safe
 
06:15:50.468 --> 06:15:50.478 align:start position:0%
and great option for many birthing
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
people but I do not believe it is a safe
 
06:15:55.390 --> 06:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
option for all birthing people research
 
06:15:57.270 --> 06:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
shows that home in the US is a safe
 
06:15:59.590 --> 06:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
option for people who are low risk I
 
06:16:02.030 --> 06:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
think hb1010 is too broad in terms of
 
06:16:04.350 --> 06:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
who it endorses as a good candidate for
 
06:16:07.350 --> 06:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
home birth as a Dartmouth as a midwife
 
06:16:09.270 --> 06:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center
 
06:16:11.468 --> 06:16:11.478 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to provide Midwife free care
 
06:16:14.070 --> 06:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
to people who have had two prior cerian
 
06:16:16.628 --> 06:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
sections and desire a vaginal birth with
 
06:16:19.110 --> 06:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
the support of the obgy in Physicians
 
06:16:20.910 --> 06:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
and anesthesiologist who work in the
 
06:16:23.350 --> 06:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
hospital with me people with two prior
 
06:16:25.150 --> 06:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
C-sections as others have said are at
 
06:16:26.548 --> 06:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
higher risk of complic ations like
 
06:16:28.750 --> 06:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
uterine rupture if a uterine rupture
 
06:16:30.310 --> 06:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
occurs a woman and her baby need
 
06:16:32.350 --> 06:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
immediate access to Anesthesia a
 
06:16:34.190 --> 06:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
C-section delivery most likely blood
 
06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
products and a neonatal intensive care
 
06:16:37.948 --> 06:16:37.958 align:start position:0%
Team all of which are immediately
 
06:16:40.030 --> 06:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
available where I practice minutes
 
06:16:42.670 --> 06:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
matter in these cases my Professional
 
06:16:44.190 --> 06:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
Organization the American College of
 
06:16:46.628 --> 06:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
nurse midwives states that the safety of
 
06:16:49.270 --> 06:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
home birth is optimized by assessing the
 
06:16:51.548 --> 06:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of the woman and family
 
06:16:54.110 --> 06:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
for home birth attendance by a qualified
 
06:16:56.070 --> 06:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
maternity care provider which I believe
 
06:16:59.150 --> 06:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
believe includes CNM and cpms and
 
06:17:00.830 --> 06:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
Integrated Systems that support
 
06:17:04.030 --> 06:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
collaborative care in summary I oppose
 
06:17:06.390 --> 06:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
hb1010 and recommend it be reviewed to
 
06:17:08.670 --> 06:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
ensure it truly upholds patient autonomy
 
06:17:10.948 --> 06:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
the right to inform decision and upholds
 
06:17:13.190 --> 06:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
the highest clinical standards of midwif
 
06:17:17.150 --> 06:17:17.160 align:start position:0%

presentation on my third child after
 
06:17:56.110 --> 06:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
rapid births for all of them I was told
 
06:17:58.350 --> 06:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
that I would be unable to I would be
 
06:18:01.110 --> 06:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
required to have a cesarian unless I had
 
06:18:03.430 --> 06:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
um a very fast birth like I had with the
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
others where they didn't have time to
 
06:18:07.070 --> 06:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
prep me for surgery in your practice are
 
06:18:09.830 --> 06:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
you able to deliver breach
 
06:18:12.750 --> 06:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
babies I as a certified nurse Midwife do
 
06:18:15.070 --> 06:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
not currently deliver breach babies
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
because I haven't had the experience or
 
06:18:19.468 --> 06:18:19.478 align:start position:0%
exposure or training to feel confident
 
06:18:22.110 --> 06:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
in that area but I know that there are
 
06:18:23.670 --> 06:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
Physicians within the Dartmouth Health
 
06:18:26.030 --> 06:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
System who do feel skilled in that area
 
06:18:28.030 --> 06:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
and can make that available to patients
 
06:18:30.590 --> 06:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
who want that thank
 
06:18:33.390 --> 06:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
you all right representative
 
06:18:35.670 --> 06:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:18:38.270 --> 06:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I heard you say at
 
06:18:40.310 --> 06:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
the beginning you said maybe I heard it
 
06:18:43.110 --> 06:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
wrong um did when you you said birthing
 
06:18:46.310 --> 06:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
people can you please clarify what that
 
06:18:48.628 --> 06:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
what that includ who that includes I
 
06:18:49.990 --> 06:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
think so not all birthing people
 
06:18:51.590 --> 06:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
identify as
 
06:18:54.150 --> 06:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
women and we support birthing people
 
06:18:58.150 --> 06:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:00.910 --> 06:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
06:19:03.868 --> 06:19:03.878 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman um
 
06:19:07.230 --> 06:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony um equally
 
06:19:12.750 --> 06:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:16.468 --> 06:19:16.478 align:start position:0%
um that breach babies are not delivered
 
06:19:18.990 --> 06:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
vaginally in New Hampshire and then
 
06:19:20.548 --> 06:19:20.558 align:start position:0%
we've heard from
 
06:19:24.350 --> 06:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
several Physicians or from you as a uh
 
06:19:26.750 --> 06:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
nurse Midwife that they are
 
06:19:26.760 --> 06:19:29.468 align:start position:0%
nurse Midwife that they are
um

06:19:29.468 --> 06:19:29.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:33.628 --> 06:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
any any ideas about why there's
 
06:19:36.708 --> 06:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
the that those differences and ideas
 
06:19:38.788 --> 06:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
about what exists and what doesn't
 
06:19:41.030 --> 06:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
exist I'm sure other people could
 
06:19:42.910 --> 06:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
comment on that as well but I think it
 
06:19:45.230 --> 06:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
goes back to the training and experience
 
06:19:47.230 --> 06:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
of the individual provider and the team
 
06:19:49.430 --> 06:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
that they're working on it is in some
 
06:19:52.190 --> 06:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
way a dying art I think many people
 
06:19:53.670 --> 06:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
historically were very comfortable
 
06:19:55.390 --> 06:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
providing breach birth and midwives in
 
06:19:57.468 --> 06:19:57.478 align:start position:0%
many settings are those providers as
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
well I've worked around the world where
 
06:20:01.510 --> 06:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
midwives do breach deliveries I've
 
06:20:03.150 --> 06:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
worked in Africa where women where
 
06:20:05.548 --> 06:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
midwives do breach deliveries um and
 
06:20:07.030 --> 06:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's the standard of practice but I
 
06:20:09.510 --> 06:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
think in the United States we don't a
 
06:20:12.708 --> 06:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
lot of providers don't have the training
 
06:20:14.670 --> 06:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
to feel comfortable offering that as an
 
06:20:17.070 --> 06:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
option but some
 
06:20:17.080 --> 06:20:18.830 align:start position:0%
option but some
do

06:20:18.830 --> 06:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:20:20.990 --> 06:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
followup I guess I'm wondering more
 
06:20:21.000 --> 06:20:22.310 align:start position:0%
followup I guess I'm wondering more
about

06:20:22.310 --> 06:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:20:25.270 --> 06:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
why why there's a very different
 
06:20:25.280 --> 06:20:26.628 align:start position:0%
why why there's a very different
perception

06:20:26.628 --> 06:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
perception
 
06:20:29.788 --> 06:20:29.798 align:start position:0%
among the medical providers that talked
 
06:20:33.350 --> 06:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
about this as an option and other people
 
06:20:35.510 --> 06:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
who are testifying that may be an
 
06:20:38.270 --> 06:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
impossible question to answer but I'm
 
06:20:40.590 --> 06:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
I'm we're hearing two different truths
 
06:20:43.190 --> 06:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
as we often do and I'm wondering if you
 
06:20:44.548 --> 06:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
could shed any light on why we're
 
06:20:44.558 --> 06:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
could shed any light on why we're
hearing

06:20:45.830 --> 06:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:20:48.468 --> 06:20:48.478 align:start position:0%
that um I think that is a difficult
 
06:20:50.030 --> 06:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
question to answer I imagine there may
 
06:20:52.150 --> 06:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
be parts of the state where the nearest
 
06:20:54.270 --> 06:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
provider who feels comfortable in doing
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
a vaginal breach is
 
06:20:59.948 --> 06:20:59.958 align:start position:0%
far away or potentially difficult to
 
06:21:02.190 --> 06:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
access other
 
06:21:07.548 --> 06:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:13.390 --> 06:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:19.868 --> 06:21:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:22.830 --> 06:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
minutes hello my name is Nicole roach I
 
06:21:25.310 --> 06:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
currently work as a doula midwif re
 
06:21:27.868 --> 06:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
assistant assistant and I am also a
 
06:21:29.910 --> 06:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
nurse uh in the time I have been
 
06:21:31.948 --> 06:21:31.958 align:start position:0%
attending births I have attended a
 
06:21:34.430 --> 06:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
variety of births in different settings
 
06:21:37.030 --> 06:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
all across the country in various
 
06:21:40.788 --> 06:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
different states where the law is
 
06:21:43.868 --> 06:21:43.878 align:start position:0%
different in all of them so I've seen um
 
06:21:46.350 --> 06:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
many different home births that don't
 
06:21:49.590 --> 06:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily happen here in New
 
06:21:52.030 --> 06:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um most of the births I have
 
06:21:54.628 --> 06:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
attended have been at home under the
 
06:21:56.070 --> 06:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
care of a
 
06:21:59.270 --> 06:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
Midwife I have seen women birth Twins
 
06:22:01.868 --> 06:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
and breach either footling breach or you
 
06:22:04.430 --> 06:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
know butt first feet first safely at
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
home I have also attended births where
 
06:22:09.030 --> 06:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
women have had multiple cesarian
 
06:22:11.590 --> 06:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
sections prior to choosing to have a
 
06:22:14.750 --> 06:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
baby at home under the care of a
 
06:22:17.310 --> 06:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
midwife these women have done so safely
 
06:22:20.070 --> 06:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
as well I have actually attended a lot
 
06:22:21.548 --> 06:22:21.558 align:start position:0%
of births in other states that would
 
06:22:23.670 --> 06:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
have been illegal in the state of New
 
06:22:25.868 --> 06:22:25.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire occasionally women in New
 
06:22:28.948 --> 06:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even choose to leave the state
 
06:22:32.030 --> 06:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
to have their babies in States like
 
06:22:34.990 --> 06:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so they can have a safe
 
06:22:36.990 --> 06:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
home birth that they Desire with a
 
06:22:37.000 --> 06:22:38.510 align:start position:0%
home birth that they Desire with a
skilled

06:22:38.510 --> 06:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
skilled
 
06:22:40.990 --> 06:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
Midwife everything mentioned in this
 
06:22:44.590 --> 06:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
bill is considered a variation of normal
 
06:22:47.310 --> 06:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
um I know after some of the testimony of
 
06:22:48.190 --> 06:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
06:22:50.990 --> 06:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians um apparently there is a
 
06:22:55.788 --> 06:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
little bit of a rift in who considers
 
06:22:58.990 --> 06:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
What A variation of normal but to me and
 
06:23:02.270 --> 06:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
in my experience attending births in
 
06:23:06.150 --> 06:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
hospital birth centers and at home
 
06:23:10.708 --> 06:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
breach Twins and you know vack are all
 
06:23:13.750 --> 06:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
variations of normal and can absolutely
 
06:23:17.510 --> 06:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
be attended safely by midwives in the
 
06:23:21.070 --> 06:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
home setting midwives all over the world
 
06:23:23.990 --> 06:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
are attending births like this safely at
 
06:23:27.350 --> 06:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
home midwife directly south of us in
 
06:23:29.030 --> 06:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
States like Massachusetts and
 
06:23:31.788 --> 06:23:31.798 align:start position:0%
Connecticut are attending births like
 
06:23:35.468 --> 06:23:35.478 align:start position:0%
this safely at home most of my clients
 
06:23:38.548 --> 06:23:38.558 align:start position:0%
from out of state are shocked when I
 
06:23:40.590 --> 06:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
tell them that they would not be able to
 
06:23:42.510 --> 06:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
have a skilled Midwife attend their
 
06:23:45.468 --> 06:23:45.478 align:start position:0%
birth at home if they lived in New
 
06:23:47.590 --> 06:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was shocked too when I
 
06:23:49.310 --> 06:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
learned about the restrictive nature of
 
06:23:51.670 --> 06:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
Midwifery care in home birth in New
 
06:23:53.990 --> 06:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most people I talk to
 
06:23:55.468 --> 06:23:55.478 align:start position:0%
especially those people that live in
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
States like Massachusetts and
 
06:23:59.110 --> 06:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
Connecticut are also very shocked about
 
06:24:00.868 --> 06:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
the restrictions that we have here in
 
06:24:03.468 --> 06:24:03.478 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
06:24:07.030 --> 06:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire truthfully this bill goes
 
06:24:07.040 --> 06:24:07.948 align:start position:0%
Hampshire truthfully this bill goes
beyond

06:24:07.948 --> 06:24:07.958 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
06:24:10.788 --> 06:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
Midwifery this is women's
 
06:24:14.070 --> 06:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
right women deserve the autonomy and the
 
06:24:17.150 --> 06:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
respect to be able to evaluate the risks
 
06:24:18.990 --> 06:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
and benefits between healthc care
 
06:24:21.030 --> 06:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
providers and birth
 
06:24:25.350 --> 06:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
settings because as many people know um
 
06:24:27.310 --> 06:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
no choice you can make here goes without
 
06:24:30.910 --> 06:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
any risk right you you choose to birth
 
06:24:32.430 --> 06:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
in the hospital there's a risk there
 
06:24:34.590 --> 06:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
choose to birth at home there's a risk
 
06:24:38.230 --> 06:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
there there's always some level of Risk
 
06:24:40.708 --> 06:24:40.718 align:start position:0%
please start wrapping up the passing of
 
06:24:42.708 --> 06:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
this bill would be a measure of risk
 
06:24:44.430 --> 06:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
reduction because under the current
 
06:24:46.948 --> 06:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
restrictions women are either for forced
 
06:24:49.510 --> 06:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
to have an unwanted Hospital birth I
 
06:24:51.230 --> 06:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
refer to that as a risk because the
 
06:24:54.190 --> 06:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
maternal death rate uh in the hospital
 
06:24:56.670 --> 06:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
is actually higher than at home or their
 
06:24:58.430 --> 06:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
other option is to have an unwanted
 
06:25:00.190 --> 06:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
unassisted birth at home without the
 
06:25:02.830 --> 06:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
care of a midwife I feel it is important
 
06:25:04.830 --> 06:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
to mention that the passing of this bill
 
06:25:06.670 --> 06:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
would not force a midwife to take a
 
06:25:07.948 --> 06:25:07.958 align:start position:0%
client that she does not feel
 
06:25:10.190 --> 06:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with taking it only gives
 
06:25:13.190 --> 06:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
midwives the freedom to work to the full
 
06:25:15.030 --> 06:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
scope of their practice and to not have
 
06:25:17.230 --> 06:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
to abandon their clients due to
 
06:25:19.430 --> 06:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
variations of normal that they might be
 
06:25:21.628 --> 06:25:21.638 align:start position:0%
comfortable dealing with there are
 
06:25:23.350 --> 06:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
continuing educational resources
 
06:25:24.948 --> 06:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
available for midwives to learn more
 
06:25:26.948 --> 06:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
about these variations of normal and to
 
06:25:29.230 --> 06:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
develop their skills the Coalition for
 
06:25:31.990 --> 06:25:32.000 align:start position:0%

06:25:36.868 --> 06:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
birders and twins trust are examples of

birth professional I am very grateful
 
06:25:50.510 --> 06:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
for this bill I think this is a positive
 
06:25:52.750 --> 06:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction I hope there
 
06:25:54.830 --> 06:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
are similar bills to follow that remove
 
06:25:57.310 --> 06:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
the necessary restrictions surrounding
 
06:25:59.868 --> 06:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
birth in New Hampshire so in closing I
 
06:26:03.430 --> 06:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
am in support of this Bill thank you any
 
06:26:06.310 --> 06:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative mlan thank you
 
06:26:07.510 --> 06:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:26:10.030 --> 06:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
question so um you mentioned experiences
 
06:26:11.990 --> 06:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
that you have had in Massachusetts and
 
06:26:16.670 --> 06:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
Connecticut yes um are you do you know
 
06:26:19.150 --> 06:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
if the provisions that are being uh
 
06:26:21.948 --> 06:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
proposed in this legislation are already
 
06:26:24.190 --> 06:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
legal in Massachusetts or Connecticut
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
they are in both of those States
 
06:26:29.310 --> 06:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
yes so I I was just going to say that
 
06:26:32.390 --> 06:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's just less restrictions and
 
06:26:35.868 --> 06:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
regulations in general in those
 
06:26:38.230 --> 06:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
States other questions representative
 
06:26:41.430 --> 06:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
Lon um thank you Mr chairman um are you
 
06:26:43.510 --> 06:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
telling me that had my child not
 
06:26:45.868 --> 06:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
returned back to a calic um the
 
06:26:47.868 --> 06:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
presentation of head down I could have
 
06:26:49.430 --> 06:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
actually fled the state of New Hampshire
 
06:26:51.350 --> 06:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
and had the birth that I wanted safely
 
06:26:53.390 --> 06:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
in another state to get that necessary
 
06:26:55.628 --> 06:26:55.638 align:start position:0%
medical care I can't
 
06:26:58.070 --> 06:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
100% say that it would be safe with no
 
06:27:00.270 --> 06:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
complications of course um but there
 
06:27:02.590 --> 06:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
would have been more than likely a
 
06:27:04.628 --> 06:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
midwife in Massachusetts that would be
 
06:27:08.310 --> 06:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
re willing to receive you as a client
 
06:27:10.190 --> 06:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
and attend your birth and provide you
 
06:27:12.708 --> 06:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
with Medical Care in a home setting you
 
06:27:14.468 --> 06:27:14.478 align:start position:0%
know you need to get like an Airbnb or
 
06:27:16.230 --> 06:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
something obviously if you were to leave
 
06:27:18.868 --> 06:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
this state but yeah this absolutely I
 
06:27:20.070 --> 06:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
have seen this happen and I have
 
06:27:22.628 --> 06:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
attended births thank you that's good to
 
06:27:24.310 --> 06:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
know should I end up in that situation
 
06:27:24.320 --> 06:27:25.750 align:start position:0%
know should I end up in that situation
again

06:27:25.750 --> 06:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
06:27:31.788 --> 06:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
mlan uh thank you uh Mr chair actually
 
06:27:34.030 --> 06:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's a question for you so I'm wondering
 
06:27:35.590 --> 06:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
in light of that would it be possible to
 
06:27:37.030 --> 06:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
maybe have the committee researcher
 
06:27:38.910 --> 06:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
maybe do a side by side on that just to
 
06:27:41.030 --> 06:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
confirm the details of
 
06:27:44.868 --> 06:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
that sure um she's apparently not here
 
06:27:48.750 --> 06:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
at the moment but yes Christina D are
 
06:27:51.628 --> 06:27:51.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:54.110 --> 06:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
there I don't think so yeah I'll check
 
06:27:55.948 --> 06:27:55.958 align:start position:0%
whether on that
 
06:27:58.190 --> 06:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
yeah give me a note on that or send me
 
06:28:00.910 --> 06:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
an email or something okay any other
 
06:28:03.910 --> 06:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
06:28:06.150 --> 06:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
you this again following up on
 
06:28:08.310 --> 06:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative mcan's uh inquiry with
 
06:28:11.150 --> 06:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
the chair I'd like to add to that inquir
 
06:28:13.910 --> 06:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
with a research if we could um one of
 
06:28:16.070 --> 06:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
the one of the industries that probably
 
06:28:18.350 --> 06:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
knows about risk more than any one of us
 
06:28:20.788 --> 06:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
is the insurance industry and I'd like
 
06:28:22.990 --> 06:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
to look at the various insurance
 
06:28:25.150 --> 06:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
policies and RIS format if you will
 
06:28:27.070 --> 06:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
across various States because if there
 
06:28:29.948 --> 06:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
are in fact variations in state law
 
06:28:32.070 --> 06:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
there may be variations in liability
 
06:28:33.990 --> 06:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
insurance because it's based upon risk
 
06:28:35.788 --> 06:28:35.798 align:start position:0%
factors so if we're really trying to get
 
06:28:38.190 --> 06:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
down to measuring risk a good place
 
06:28:39.910 --> 06:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
maybe to look is the insurance industry
 
06:28:41.310 --> 06:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
because if anyone knows risk and
 
06:28:43.468 --> 06:28:43.478 align:start position:0%
monitors risk more than anyone else the
 
06:28:46.910 --> 06:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
insurance industry sure did you get all
 
06:28:46.920 --> 06:28:49.310 align:start position:0%
insurance industry sure did you get all
that

06:28:49.310 --> 06:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:28:52.510 --> 06:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
Christina okay all right any other
 
06:28:55.230 --> 06:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
questions or comments seeing no thank
 
06:28:57.468 --> 06:28:57.478 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative tees yeah
 
06:28:59.670 --> 06:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
just to clarify I would propose that we
 
06:29:01.990 --> 06:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't just look at Massachusetts right
 
06:29:03.590 --> 06:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to compare what's
 
06:29:04.910 --> 06:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
happening in other states that's
 
06:29:07.390 --> 06:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
relevant it should be
 
06:29:09.548 --> 06:29:09.558 align:start position:0%
comprehensive thank
 
06:29:13.350 --> 06:29:13.360 align:start position:0%

06:30:06.948 --> 06:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
propose to testimony here based on my
 
06:30:11.948 --> 06:30:11.958 align:start position:0%
profession and um my 17 years of being a
 
06:30:14.110 --> 06:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
midwife and attending out of Hospital
 
06:30:16.830 --> 06:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
births having received over 700 babies
 
06:30:19.910 --> 06:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
in my hands and never having lost a
 
06:30:25.230 --> 06:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
baby so H so I as we discuss this bill
 
06:30:27.868 --> 06:30:27.878 align:start position:0%
this bill needs to be considered under
 
06:30:30.468 --> 06:30:30.478 align:start position:0%
the offices of direct of the New
 
06:30:32.948 --> 06:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Midwifery Council and the
 
06:30:36.548 --> 06:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
women and The Midwives who actually um
 
06:30:39.628 --> 06:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
would be performing any of these things
 
06:30:43.990 --> 06:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
to their lure and to their um
 
06:30:46.510 --> 06:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
experience I'm the head of an
 
06:30:49.230 --> 06:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
international um disaster relief
 
06:30:51.670 --> 06:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
organization that won CNN hero of the
 
06:30:55.910 --> 06:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
Year award that is cpms that get called
 
06:30:58.670 --> 06:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
to disaster areas in low resourced areas
 
06:31:00.708 --> 06:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
where there are lots and lots of
 
06:31:04.030 --> 06:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunate low low resourced
 
06:31:05.708 --> 06:31:05.718 align:start position:0%
opportunities to have
 
06:31:08.868 --> 06:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
babies what I want you to know is that
 
06:31:12.150 --> 06:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
that women in lower resourced areas in
 
06:31:13.948 --> 06:31:13.958 align:start position:0%
underdeveloped countries would give
 
06:31:17.230 --> 06:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
anything for safeguards to be in place
 
06:31:20.830 --> 06:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
those safeguards do not include the over
 
06:31:23.830 --> 06:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
safeguarding quote unquote of OG of the
 
06:31:26.190 --> 06:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
American College of of Obstetrics and
 
06:31:28.708 --> 06:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
Gynecology that has superimposed their
 
06:31:32.190 --> 06:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
idea of what is safe not really being
 
06:31:35.788 --> 06:31:35.798 align:start position:0%
informed about what my profession's
 
06:31:38.270 --> 06:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
training my it is not just about
 
06:31:40.788 --> 06:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
attending a few bursts it's a three-year
 
06:31:43.270 --> 06:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's a three-year Midwifery program of
 
06:31:45.708 --> 06:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
some sort or another not just a high
 
06:31:48.430 --> 06:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
school degree I consider that extremely
 
06:31:51.750 --> 06:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
degrading for the reputation I have what
 
06:31:54.750 --> 06:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
I also would like to say in testimony is
 
06:31:57.948 --> 06:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
that the safety of breach the safety out
 
06:31:59.910 --> 06:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
of in an out of hospital setting either
 
06:32:01.948 --> 06:32:01.958 align:start position:0%
at home or in my birth center which is
 
06:32:04.430 --> 06:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
not legal in my birth center we don't
 
06:32:07.548 --> 06:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
have that but the safety of these of
 
06:32:11.590 --> 06:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
these um of the pro proposals in this
 
06:32:14.750 --> 06:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill have everything to do with not just
 
06:32:18.270 --> 06:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
taking a class or not just you know
 
06:32:20.628 --> 06:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
having a experience of one or two but to
 
06:32:23.510 --> 06:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
have literally an experience inside when
 
06:32:25.468 --> 06:32:25.478 align:start position:0%
you're in an out of Hospital setting
 
06:32:29.670 --> 06:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
which you go this is okay the the true

06:32:42.230 --> 06:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
is how do we keep the resources

this transformational time in their life
 
06:33:57.030 --> 06:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
the conversation should not be stopped
 
06:33:59.310 --> 06:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
simply because some Washington Post
 
06:34:01.868 --> 06:34:01.878 align:start position:0%
reporter wrote something or some
 
06:34:05.750 --> 06:34:05.760 align:start position:0%

the it's medpro I think yes other
 
06:35:21.030 --> 06:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Murphy thank
 
06:35:22.990 --> 06:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
06:35:26.230 --> 06:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
um so you are are you are adamantly
 
06:35:28.030 --> 06:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill as written as you
 
06:35:30.468 --> 06:35:30.478 align:start position:0%
said is that BEC because I know where
 
06:35:32.708 --> 06:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
your building is you are literally
 
06:35:35.150 --> 06:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
neighbors to Dartmouth Hitchcock you
 
06:35:37.468 --> 06:35:37.478 align:start position:0%
could throw a stone into their yard so
 
06:35:39.070 --> 06:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
is it because it's not because of the
 
06:35:41.548 --> 06:35:41.558 align:start position:0%
distance obviously from where you are to
 
06:35:43.948 --> 06:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
having a backup source to take care of
 
06:35:46.190 --> 06:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
any troubles you may have so is your
 
06:35:48.510 --> 06:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill based on the
 
06:35:51.708 --> 06:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
indications uh for home delivery meaning
 
06:35:54.590 --> 06:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
um you know multiple you know um uh
 
06:35:56.590 --> 06:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
previous C-sections or breach
 
06:35:59.230 --> 06:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
presentation or so I'm just trying to
 
06:36:00.468 --> 06:36:00.478 align:start position:0%
understand why you were opposed because
 
06:36:02.468 --> 06:36:02.478 align:start position:0%
I know that you are very very close to a
 
06:36:05.830 --> 06:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
backup facility so is it is it
 
06:36:07.350 --> 06:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
principally because of the indications
 
06:36:11.190 --> 06:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
for home delivery that you oppose no I'm
 
06:36:14.990 --> 06:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill primarily
 
06:36:15.000 --> 06:36:18.628 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill primarily
because

06:36:18.628 --> 06:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:22.590 --> 06:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
um um because the bill isn't written
 
06:36:26.270 --> 06:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
accurately to address the things that
 
06:36:29.388 --> 06:36:29.398 align:start position:0%
need to uh what um what I think it was
 
06:36:32.388 --> 06:36:32.398 align:start position:0%
Beth who said there's not enough in the
 
06:36:37.468 --> 06:36:37.478 align:start position:0%
bill that's written as it is to actually
 
06:36:39.270 --> 06:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
what are the requirements that would
 
06:36:42.868 --> 06:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
make it safe for you for me as a midwife
 
06:36:46.070 --> 06:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
I mean I I I don't take chances like I'm
 
06:36:48.868 --> 06:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
pretty conservative about what I do but
 
06:36:51.350 --> 06:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
how do we build this in as a safety net
 
06:36:53.788 --> 06:36:53.798 align:start position:0%
for both the mid The Midwives who are
 
06:36:55.910 --> 06:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
certified and licensed in the state of
 
06:36:58.468 --> 06:36:58.478 align:start position:0%
Vermont by the Midwifery Council to
 
06:37:01.788 --> 06:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
protect the public as well as offer
 
06:37:03.750 --> 06:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
choice so that over and over we've
 
06:37:07.388 --> 06:37:07.398 align:start position:0%
talked about women don't just go sorry
 
06:37:09.910 --> 06:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
I'm out of here because I'm just doing a
 
06:37:12.750 --> 06:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
freeth we have to have this more
 
06:37:16.110 --> 06:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive for protection of
 
06:37:18.388 --> 06:37:18.398 align:start position:0%
everybody and I also want to say that
 
06:37:21.190 --> 06:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
massach the Massachusetts um comparison
 
06:37:23.388 --> 06:37:23.398 align:start position:0%
is not an equal comparison they're not a
 
06:37:25.190 --> 06:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
licensed state St so they don't have
 
06:37:27.750 --> 06:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations just as you're
 
06:37:30.548 --> 06:37:30.558 align:start position:0%

06:39:12.388 --> 06:39:12.398 align:start position:0%
and healthiest way to birth a baby is
 
06:39:16.310 --> 06:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
vaginally with trained

is currently imploding and harming
 
06:43:33.150 --> 06:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
people while the medical system tries to
