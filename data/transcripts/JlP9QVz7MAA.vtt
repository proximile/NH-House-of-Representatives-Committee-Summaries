on that
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
i think it's prudent of us to to wait
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
and see what happens with the budget
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
and the uh the various tax cuts that are
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
and we can hold this in abeyance and
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
and pull it out if we need it later on
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%

baxter were you able to
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
get that amendment thank you mr chair
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
um so as i communicated with you
 
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.949 align:start position:0%
um so as i communicated with you
yesterday

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
i talked to the dra and
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
we agreed upon language and essentially
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
what we did
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
is my amendment originally talked about
 
00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:53.269 align:start position:0%
is my amendment originally talked about
the

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
provider so um travel safe
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
service agents but this amendment makes
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
it cleaner and it just
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
changes it to looking at um the charge
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
that way you can't basically be wholly
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
exempt if
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
part of your business is a travel
 
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.670 align:start position:0%
part of your business is a travel
service

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
um agent agency so that was the change
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
they recommended and i thought
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
their proposed language was fine so the
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
only hang up right now
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
is it's already been submitted to oos
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
they just
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
need to review it um so i would
 
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.350 align:start position:0%
need to review it um so i would
recommend

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
that we wait until we get it back from
 
00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.110 align:start position:0%
that we wait until we get it back from
os

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
os
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
and next week we can vote on the
 
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.630 align:start position:0%
and next week we can vote on the
amendment

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then pass the bill that way
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully this can end up on consent
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
and it won't take up any time on the
 
00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:48.870 align:start position:0%
and it won't take up any time on the
floor

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%

end of the day after we had the
 
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
we agreed upon the proposed language and
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:36.829 align:start position:0%

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
us on i
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
was not entirely sure which language
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
from that long
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
email was supposed to be being
 
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:51.990 align:start position:0%
email was supposed to be being
considered

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%

00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
get a a clean copy of that
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative baxter could send
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
what he
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
one of the uh lucky parts about being
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
young is i have good eyesight
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
for now maybe because now the whole
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
thing isn't showing
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
okay let's i'll say one i think it
 
00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:49.350 align:start position:0%
okay let's i'll say one i think it
should

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
or just scroll down a little bit yeah
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
so it's just from right here where my
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
cursor is right
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
so what was added was what
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
what isn't hello yes exactly
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
and essentially what what the what they
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
were doing
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
is my original amendment was talking
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
about the occupation travel service
 
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.509 align:start position:0%
about the occupation travel service
agents

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
agents
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
but there was the issue that that might
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
wholly exempt
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
someone that a small part of their
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
business is them being a travel service
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
agent which would not was not what was
 
00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:38.870 align:start position:0%
agent which would not was not what was
intended

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
so this changes it to the
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the charges so amounts
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
paid by an operator to a travel agent or
 
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.269 align:start position:0%
paid by an operator to a travel agent or
commission

00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
and then exempt that the term rent shall
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
not include amounts paid by an operator
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
to a travel agent as commissioner
 
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.269 align:start position:0%
to a travel agent as commissioner
compensation

00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
for travel agent services so looking at
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
so what has been sent over to the
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
yeah this is this is from os the email
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
sent to all of us
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
itself so this is this is how the
 
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:26.629 align:start position:0%
itself so this is this is how the
amendment

00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
but i imagine we can meet um
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
back next week i don't know when all of
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
us will we'll
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
send something over it could even be
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
tomorrow if we could all meet tomorrow
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't take uh that long once
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
once we have something back from all of
 
00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:49.030 align:start position:0%
once we have something back from all of
us

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't been noted to meet tomorrow
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
but we will be meeting oh my god okay
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is a week from today
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
because next tuesday is election day
 
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.789 align:start position:0%
because next tuesday is election day
everybody

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
so this could be taken up
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
on election day is everybody agreeable
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
senator mr chair um
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
if i may go forward um yeah
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
the uh this looks good to me on the face
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh but uh it looks like we'll have a
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
little time to look closely at it so i
 
00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:42.630 align:start position:0%
little time to look closely at it so i
think

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
the the plan would be to go
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
into executive session presumably maybe
 
00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:49.350 align:start position:0%
into executive session presumably maybe
a

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
little prior discussion when we next
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
meet which would be wednesday next week
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh and then unless some
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
wrinkle is identified we're off and
 
00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:03.830 align:start position:0%
wrinkle is identified we're off and
running

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
running
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's the way i would understand it we
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the actual amendment in front
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
yet and so we should process it
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
and i think we've got plenty of time uh
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
since we don't have a scheduled
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
so mr mr chairman representative
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
you have uh representative nunes and
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury wanting to
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
talk and it might be better if they do
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
it today rather than
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
wait till to wednesday but i think the
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
chair was going to respond to what i
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
just said
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
come next wednesday
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think we need to take a vote and
 
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.390 align:start position:0%
i think we need to take a vote and
examine

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
examine
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
whether the amendment is not ready or
 
00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:54.710 align:start position:0%
whether the amendment is not ready or
not

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
we should be able to execute because it
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
can always have a forum and then
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
the floor amendment could have the
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
support of
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
the whole committee in our particular
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
both but i think we need to move this
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
thing out
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
but as far as discussion we're open to
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
discussion right now
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh did you call on me mr chairman yes
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
um i just thank you mr chairman i have i
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
have a question for representative
 
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.549 align:start position:0%
have a question for representative
baxter

00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
baxter
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
in your conversation with um with drs
 
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.310 align:start position:0%
in your conversation with um with drs
did

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
did did you guys work out the way that
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
they would be looking at the rules
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh that would be created going towards
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
the rules committee i'm taking it
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
i want to take it for granted this is
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
going to fix that but i want to hear it
 
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.669 align:start position:0%
going to fix that but i want to hear it
from

00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
you guys that this is going to uh ease
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
ease up the conflict that she was
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
the assistant commissioner was talking
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
about before
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
um making the rules off of off the
 
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.990 align:start position:0%
um making the rules off of off the
statute

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative i think we
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
this process basically she put in an
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
amendment that she'd be comfortable with
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
that would have
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
um what she was saying she felt that
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
could be accomplished in
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
rules so i think it's sort of just
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
ironing out
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
some of those details ahead of time
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
instead of doing it in the rules process
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's basically how i took it i looked
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
over the language she sent back
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
and i actually thought it was it was a
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
better approach than my amendment
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
originally and it ironed out the
 
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.909 align:start position:0%
originally and it ironed out the
concerns

00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
that she had and that other members had
 
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.270 align:start position:0%
that she had and that other members had
so

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
i i think it's just it's much simpler
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
and easier and in terms of whether we
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
exact this today or we wait till the
 
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.870 align:start position:0%
exact this today or we wait till the
10th

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
10th
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
a big thing that's going on is just our
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
time on the floor
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
and if we can get this out um unanimous
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
or maybe there might be one person or
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
something like that that doesn't vote
 
00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.270 align:start position:0%
something like that that doesn't vote
for

00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
it could go on consent and that's going
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
to save us a lot of time versus if we
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
have to have a floor amendment
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
if it's not unanimous if we have to
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
debate this or whatever on the floor
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
i would rather just wait to the 10th
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
take five minutes
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
and exec it out and have it be on
 
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.110 align:start position:0%
and exec it out and have it be on
consent

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
so that's just my suggestion for um for
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to hear what other members
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee think about that as
 
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.390 align:start position:0%
of the committee think about that as
well

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for your
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the answer
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes sir mr chair i'm great thank you
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative spillsberg
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i appreciate
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
what uh representative basker but facts
 
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.070 align:start position:0%
what uh representative basker but facts
are

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
trying to do and i do think that this
 
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.230 align:start position:0%
trying to do and i do think that this
approach

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
is better than uh than the one we were
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
looking at yesterday
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
so my fear was that uh
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
amending the definition of operator was
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
going to largely gut the intent of the
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
bill so now we're
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
we are proposing to amend the
 
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.830 align:start position:0%
we are proposing to amend the
definitions

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
of

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
gross rental receipts and
 
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
elaborate on full retail price charge
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
take gross rental receipts
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
what this then does is lists three
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
things and now a fourth
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
that um are not to be included
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
in a gross rate of receipt and those are
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
things like
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
separate charges for insurance
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
or for fuel that's very logical
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
i think this amendment though invites
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
the operators
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
to begin stating
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
um booking commissions
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
as a separate charge to remove them from
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
their meals and rooms rather than to
 
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
leave them in
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
and as far as you know i can see the
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
normal business practice is
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
that a room operator
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
car rental operator grosses up their
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
charges determines their profit level
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
decides what they're going to charge the
 
00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:18.630 align:start position:0%
decides what they're going to charge the
customer

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
customer
 
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
and then pays their expenses including
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
booking commissions so
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'm still not totally comfortable with
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
this and i
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
guess where i would go with with my
 
00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:30.710 align:start position:0%
guess where i would go with with my
doubt

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
is back to carolyn lear's note
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
where she says we think that the bill is
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
reasonably clear as it is
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
and gives us the uh power
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh in the rule-making authority to
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
clarify things now in a rule-making
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
authority they can be much more granular
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
specific take testimony and
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
take comments on a proposed rule
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we're in a position
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
here to deal with it as carefully as
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
they would
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
so i think there are ambiguities that
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
remain um
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
and so again you know with the full
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
respect for
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
what representative baxter is attempting
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
i think we could probably better leave
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
representing early
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
what is the uh our time schedule on this
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair can we wait until the 10th or
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
later

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
the 11th is the last day to report all
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
house bills
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
in the second committee except the
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
budget bills
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
so that the 10th
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
and you have one day after that
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
so we either voted up or down on the uh
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
with amendment or without an amendment
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
on the 10th other than that we're going
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
to have to screw around with it on the
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
floor if anyone has any objections
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
i just wanted that to be clear to the
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
members okay
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing is sir in the past the
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee has done things
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh pending uh
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
ols approval do we want to consider that
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
now or do you think we have plenty of
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
time on the
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
10th to mesh this out
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
i was going to throw that out but i
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
thought i'd wait to hear from everybody
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's an option but i don't know how
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair just to follow up uh to help
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
everybody and to
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
to help uh representative baxter
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh would it be appropriate that we get a
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
a sense of the committee uh at this
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
point so that he knows
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
um what uh
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
how we feel basically
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes we can do that um but why don't we
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
wait until
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
everybody makes their comments and
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair it seemed to me
 
00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:40.549 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair it seemed to me
before

00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
your plan about um
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
completing this bill on the 10th after
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
we probably will have the amendment
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
seemed fine
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
now it seems like we're looking at other
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
options but
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
it seemed like your original comments
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
about that were going to work fine
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
and on the 10th we can go up or down on
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment and then up or down on the
 
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.549 align:start position:0%
the amendment and then up or down on the
bill

00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
and we're done that's that's the
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
committee's choice
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
so i support that suggestion from you
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for representing all
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
of me
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
if i can remember now what i was trying
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
to when i put my hand up before
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh this um
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
i think that it would be useful if we
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
could get
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
on on miss lear to get
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
on on uh into this conversation right
 
00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:41.830 align:start position:0%
on on uh into this conversation right
now

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
to to talk to us about the the
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh problem that might be caused by
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
putting that
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh first part of the amendment in the
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
second part of the amendment doesn't
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
look like
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
its problem the first one is in a place
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
where everything else has been
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh put on the receipt um
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
i think that it since she agreed to it
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
before she'd be okay but it
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
would be helpful i think if we had that
 
00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:09.990 align:start position:0%
would be helpful i think if we had that
resolved

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
now so that we don't if we try to go
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
back with an amendment on the 10th
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're probably going to be a lot of
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
committees doing that
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
right then janine can you
 
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.149 align:start position:0%
right then janine can you
let

00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:49.090 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:49.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.510 align:start position:0%

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
of revenue here
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
i've been listening discussion um
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
but i think it would be helpful to uh if
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative almi could repeat this
 
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.230 align:start position:0%
representative almi could repeat this
specific

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
question that she was wishing for me to
 
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.750 align:start position:0%
question that she was wishing for me to
answer

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
yes i was trying to get the the language
 
00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:18.470 align:start position:0%
yes i was trying to get the the language
back

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
up i took a screenshot of it
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
mr chair i just wanted to update you
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
real quickly i just got an email
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
um from jeff from ols and he said he's
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
gonna send it out as soon as possible so
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
we might get that
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay susan have you
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh i'm sorry
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
i don't seem to be able to both look at
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
the language and
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
unmute myself um
 
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.830 align:start position:0%
unmute myself um
can

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
here i think i'm doing a work around now
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
but a share on the screen would be nice
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
um maybe representative baxter can put
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
thank you so on the second
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
yellow part seems like
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have any problem at all the
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
question is whether
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's a problem that uh the first yellow
 
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.230 align:start position:0%
it's a problem that uh the first yellow
part

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
d uh amounts paid by an operator to a
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
travel agent as commissioner
 
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.909 align:start position:0%
travel agent as commissioner
compensation

00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
is out of sync with the rest of that
 
00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:05.110 align:start position:0%
is out of sync with the rest of that
section

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
which is separate charges
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i tend to agree with you
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
that a through c very clearly
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
charges that are paid by the consumer
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
and section d is explicitly dealing with
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
that are paid by the operator to a
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
travel agent
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
as commission um
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know from a drafting standpoint
 
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.990 align:start position:0%
i don't know from a drafting standpoint
whether

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
um that will be seen as a fatal issue
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully um ols will will weigh in on
 
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.470 align:start position:0%
hopefully um ols will will weigh in on
that

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
um it just seemed as though the only
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
logical place
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
um if you do um add that language to do
 
00:32:05.679 --> 00:32:09.669 align:start position:0%
um if you do um add that language to do
so

00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
would it be possible
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
to just stick i don't know what it would
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
be uh romans 6
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
a uh or something like that
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
to just stick in at the bottom amounts
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
paid by an operator to travel agents
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner compensation for the
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
travel agents services on
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
shall not be considered part
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative i'm not sure
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
that i followed
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
my brain must be working a little slow
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
this morning yeah well mine is not too
 
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.230 align:start position:0%
this morning yeah well mine is not too
happy

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
happy
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
either so on
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
there to have a second section under
 
00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:00.389 align:start position:0%
there to have a second section under
roman

00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
roman
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
6 that just says amounts paid by an
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
operator to a travel agent as
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner compensation for the travel
 
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:07.909 align:start position:0%
commissioner compensation for the travel
agent

00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
agent
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
services on are not part of gross rental
 
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.029 align:start position:0%
services on are not part of gross rental
receipts

00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
from my perspective that wouldn't change
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
the meaning
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so that would be fine i would defer
 
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.310 align:start position:0%
um so that would be fine i would defer
to

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
ols on preferred from a drafting
 
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.549 align:start position:0%
ols on preferred from a drafting
standpoint

00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative baxter could
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative ahmee can you just repeat
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
the the question that you wanted me to
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
address specifically
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
um under roman six
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh you've got gross receipts means and
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
the term shall not
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
include a through c and then
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
on somehow after romans 6
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
romans 6 a or whatever it is that they
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
could do
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
amounts paid by an operator to a travel
 
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.509 align:start position:0%
amounts paid by an operator to a travel
agent

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
agent
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
on show on on
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
on is not considered as part of
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
gross rental receipts or some such
 
00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:16.470 align:start position:0%
gross rental receipts or some such
wording

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay so to clarify you just want it in a
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
slightly different
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
spot um hopefully that will provide some
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
clarity that's kind of what you're
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're like oh i was trying to to
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
address i think it's representative
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
spellberg's points
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
point that it is is
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
not part of the charges paid by the
 
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.790 align:start position:0%
not part of the charges paid by the
consumer

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
it would be a separate section roman
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
mr chairs if i can i just want to speak
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
to you real quick representative
 
00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:52.869 align:start position:0%
to you real quick representative
spillsberry's

00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
spillsberry's
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
um his uh concerns and it was it was my
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
the way this was written um by carolyn
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
the dra felt comfortable
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
through the rule-making process that
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
this would have
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
the outcome that was intended um and so
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
i would just
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
want to ask to her again if you know if
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
she still feels comfortable with this
 
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.950 align:start position:0%
she still feels comfortable with this
amendment

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to lead to any
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
unforeseen outcomes
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
like the ones spillsbury is potentially
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
yes representative baxter with this
 
00:35:29.839 --> 00:35:30.630 align:start position:0%
yes representative baxter with this
language

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
i feel comfortable that either
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
rules won't be necessary or if we do
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
determine that rules
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
are necessary that we'll be able to um
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
clearly enact what the committee is
 
00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:46.310 align:start position:0%
clearly enact what the committee is
intending

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i agree with that too it's
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
if i can jump in again yes
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
the incongruity is this
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
roman numeral six is a definition of
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
gross rental
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
receipts gross rental seats are amounts
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
paid by the customer to the operator
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
but little d which has been added has
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
gross rental receipts it's simply
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
a statement i believe that a particular
 
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.710 align:start position:0%
a statement i believe that a particular
expense

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
expense
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
is not going to be taxed twice
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
clearly an amount paid by the
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
customer to the operator is subject to
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
and if we're trying to say anything here
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's that
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
when the operator then goes and pays the
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
commission it's not taxed a second time
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh it really doesn't fit in a definition
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
of gross rental receipts
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
i'm representing spillsberry a lot of
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
things that we do
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
writing tax law are
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
cya in nature that is our belts and
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
suspender is the
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
more um acceptable term i underst
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
i suppose that is yeah it may not belong
 
00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:32.390 align:start position:0%
i suppose that is yeah it may not belong
there

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
but we're saying it anyway so that you
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
get the message
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's kind of uh yeah your belt holds
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
your pants up
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
and so do use your suspenders you don't
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
need both
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people do and this
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
we do and i think that's what section d
 
00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:50.950 align:start position:0%
we do and i think that's what section d
is

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's a belts and suspenders approach so
 
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.950 align:start position:0%
it's a belts and suspenders approach so
that

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
if if a jail car ever gets a chance to
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
they'll look at it and say well they
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
commission doesn't count because they
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
said it here
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
and they said it here and they set it
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
everywhere so
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what it is yeah it may
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
not exactly
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
fit where it is but it does clarify
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't fit i that that's my
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
take on this
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very briefly um i take your
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
point but i think this one is not so
 
00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:29.109 align:start position:0%
point but i think this one is not so
much

00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
an example of what you're saying i think
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
this is going to be red to give the
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
wrong message and it's going to
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to basically say go ahead and
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
list this
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
charge separately and you'll be fine and
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
it'll be exempt from tax
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the gross amount that the customer
 
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.870 align:start position:0%
and the gross amount that the customer
pays

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
pays
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know what's subject to tax anyway
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i think i've made my point i don't
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
you're muted yeah got it
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
um i guess there's maybe
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
asking the question that we're exploring
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
in a different way but i just want to
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
whether there is any danger that
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
a travel agent working with an operator
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
could have essentially gained this
 
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.109 align:start position:0%
could have essentially gained this
system

00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
and effectively
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the rent that's subject to the
 
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.310 align:start position:0%
reduce the rent that's subject to the
tax

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
and raise the travel agent
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
compensation number
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
good question thank you for the
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
question representative um it sounds
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
like you all
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
um saw the email that i sent to
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative baxter yesterday
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
and before i i suggested
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
the language that you have before you i
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
did try to reiterate the point
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
that i do think it's clear under the
 
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.309 align:start position:0%
that i do think it's clear under the
statute

00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
um without any additional language that
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
amounts paid um but the the
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
tax only captures amounts paid by the
 
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.950 align:start position:0%
tax only captures amounts paid by the
consumer

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
um and doesn't um capture in the tax
 
00:40:32.319 --> 00:40:32.790 align:start position:0%
um and doesn't um capture in the tax
base

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
base
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
amounts paid um between
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
the operator and any service provider
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
um because it's a tax on a consumer
 
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.069 align:start position:0%
um because it's a tax on a consumer
transaction

00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
i only say that because i think of
 
00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:48.309 align:start position:0%
i only say that because i think of
course

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
inherent in adding any language is
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
the risk that someone will find a way
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
to um utilize it to
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
um potentially exempt a transaction
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
that they that we don't intend to be
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
exempt i think that's always a risk and
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
certainly could be a risk
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
with this language as well i mean i've
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
certainly because that's
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
my job as the tax administrator to um
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
try to propose something that i thought
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
was uh as
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
tight as it could be um
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
but my answer would be that that is
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you represented southwark
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
you muted i know i it wasn't it's not
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
the muting that's my finger like most
 
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.390 align:start position:0%
the muting that's my finger like most
people

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to clarify
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
um with a miss lear going back to the
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
um at that point you felt it was fine
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
without an amendment and you thought
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
rules could handle it
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make sure from your
 
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.470 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make sure from your
perspective

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
that that choice is still on the table
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
to just pass the bill
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes i agree with that statement um i
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think that um
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment is necessary to achieve
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
or clarify um what this amendment
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
seeks to clarify i think that
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
the statute does make clear
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
that commissions paid by the operator to
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
a travel agent
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
are is not taxable and i do think it's
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
clear enough
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
that i would be comfortable saying that
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
we have the authority to enact rules
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
to such effect thank you
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i wanted to address on
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
something i think it was representative
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
hollery said
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
i do not think that a lot of travel
 
00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:05.990 align:start position:0%
i do not think that a lot of travel
agents

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
agents
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
would want to have their commission
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
on on
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
public documents that the that the
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh customer sees i've never seen them
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
do that kind of thing the commissions
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
are always kind of hidden in the
 
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.870 align:start position:0%
are always kind of hidden in the
background

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
on if we had to do something like this
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
could we maybe change d to any amounts
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
paid uh that appear
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
as a charge which
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any comments or
 
00:43:48.319 --> 00:43:50.950 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any comments or
questions

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i think we've got
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
to address an issue here
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
is what we've heard from the
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner is that
 
00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:03.710 align:start position:0%
she feels comfortable with the
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:05.270 align:start position:0%
she feels comfortable with the
[Music]

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill as is and that
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
any issue with it can be taken care of
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
through the rules
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
and then we also have the other thing
 
00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:18.950 align:start position:0%
and then we also have the other thing
that

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know we need to have an amendment
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to find out from the
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
committee how the
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee feel should we
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
go the route of no amendment
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
or the right amendment
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
and uh this is not
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's an indication how the members feel
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then you can vote twice if you want
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
who would vote for this
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
without an amendment
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
could we raise our hands yes virtually
 
00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.990 align:start position:0%
could we raise our hands yes virtually
or

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
let's do it this way if you are
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
against putting this
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
in without an amendment has ought to
 
00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:35.030 align:start position:0%
in without an amendment has ought to
pass

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
putting this in as ought to pass without
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%

the dra and they said that
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
this would help them in their making
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
their rules and that it would clarify
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
things for them
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
she also just said to us just a few
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
minutes ago that she didn't know
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
if that last line that we were looking
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
at in there on that d line or whatever
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
was going to cause come out of ols
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
differently than what it's expected
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
until we see the actual amendment
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
come out of ols and know the way that
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's been legally worded by
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
the legal team in there then then i
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
think we're
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
sort of voting on something right now
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
that we're not seeing the true amendment
 
00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
yet we're just seeing
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
the words that were sent as we all know
 
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.710 align:start position:0%
the words that were sent as we all know
ols

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
ols
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
changes things sometimes when it gets
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
there so until we see the amendment can
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
we not
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
vote on this until we see the actual
 
00:52:36.559 --> 00:52:40.069 align:start position:0%
vote on this until we see the actual
amendment

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman on everybody's got their
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
hands up for a kind of
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
straw vote at this point and we can't
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
tell who wants
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
i forgot what the the question was in
 
00:53:00.559 --> 00:53:01.030 align:start position:0%
i forgot what the the question was in
this

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
alaska vote mr chairman the question
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
the question was can we not do this
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
until we see the actual amendment
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's my question because as was stated
 
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.190 align:start position:0%
that's my question because as was stated
earlier

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
when it's got to go to ols and we need
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it comes out of ols
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
with the intention
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
provided and we don't know that that's
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen because of one
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
line that's in there although the
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
did state to us just a few minutes ago
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
that she wanted to look at that line as
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
well to make sure that it comes out
 
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.150 align:start position:0%
well to make sure that it comes out
correctly

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
until we have that language that's back
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
from them in an actual amendment then
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
i my suggestion is let's wait for the
 
00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:53.589 align:start position:0%
i my suggestion is let's wait for the
amendment

00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman no wait i want to have
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
carolyn explain something again
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
carolyn without the amendment do
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
do we need the amendment to accomplish
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
carolyn representative major thank you
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'll i'll answer while refl
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
rephrasing it slightly
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that you need the
 
00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.109 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that you need the
amendment

00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure that the fees
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
paid to travel agents by
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
operators as commissions are not
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax i think it is clear
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
as the legislation is drafted without an
 
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.030 align:start position:0%
as the legislation is drafted without an
amendment

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
that those fees are not subject to tax
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to hold this until
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
the 10th
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i also um personally
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
i agree with the commissioner
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
but i'm holding this until the 10th
 
00:55:14.559 --> 00:55:15.030 align:start position:0%
but i'm holding this until the 10th
you'll

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to look at the
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and we will vote on it
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
i had emailed you the information i
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
received from the
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee relative to the
 
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.190 align:start position:0%
finance committee relative to the
sections

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
on house bill 2 that we need to look at
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
now when i looked at on the internet
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 was up on the internet
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
and uh but it's like a lot of pages
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
170 pages or so
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
and you can either do one of two things
 
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.990 align:start position:0%
and you can either do one of two things
either

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
get a copy over it at the lme
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
or try to work with it
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
on the internet or just download those
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
specific pages but
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
not only looking at those sections that
 
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.510 align:start position:0%
not only looking at those sections that
they

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
told us about what i would do
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
as a minimum i would go to the houseboat
 
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.309 align:start position:0%
as a minimum i would go to the houseboat
too

00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
and download and print the first
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
six pages the first six pages
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
is the analysis because there may be
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
other sections there that weren't
 
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.230 align:start position:0%
other sections there that weren't
identified

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
because don't really want to be
 
00:56:57.359 --> 00:56:58.069 align:start position:0%
because don't really want to be
surprised

00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
surprised
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
the last minute there were some sections
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
that weren't identified by finance
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
that we need to do a
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
quick analysis on i'd rather analyze
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
these things right now rather than wait
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
to the last minute
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of homework to do
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments for anything
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
there's a couple hands up okay yeah

and the easiest way is
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
is to go to the analysis and stop there
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
but make sure you cover all the points
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
sent to us and then we'll also take care
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
of those other five bills
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
those other five bills that were second
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
committee bills
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
you look at them we will not touch the
 
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
policy we're not going to debate the
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
policy that's been passed by the house
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
we're only going to to look at those
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
parts that have to do
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
there may be a bill 10 pages and nine
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
and a half pages
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
is policy so you have to find where it
 
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:52.470 align:start position:0%
is policy so you have to find where it
is

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
and i plan to go through it and i'll
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
send you out an
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
email which i think
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
and that's for we need to vote on that
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
they need to be reported out on their
 
01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.470 align:start position:0%
they need to be reported out on their
weapons

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay mr chairman yes
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
on two things i think that we have
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
until we have until the 18th
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's in the the deadlines
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
in the calendar yes and right we have
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
18 second committee bills right yes
 
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
and the second uh thing is that at least
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
one of those bills we have because
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
on they took the fees out of it in the
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
they left in the uh dedicated
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
fund the rating of the dedicated funds
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
in order to pay for the database that
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
they want
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
and that rating was supposed to be
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
recompensed by the fees
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
that they took out so the question that
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
is what do we think of of the
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
stability of those dedicated funds
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the rules have dedicated funds in
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the rest of that bill
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
episode of elliot has his hand raised
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
represented elliot yes there's been so
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
much confusion over
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
this bill that i see no problem with
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
both parties having a caucus on how they
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
feel about this and i suggest that we
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
hold off
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
i like the idea of postponing it to the
 
01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:14.230 align:start position:0%
i like the idea of postponing it to the
10th

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
10th
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
but i would prefer to have a republican
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
caucus and the democrats can have one
 
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
caucus and the democrats can have one
too

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
to exactly what it is we're voting on
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
because there's so much confusion on
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the bill obviously that i think we
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
need to spend a little bit more time on
 
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.390 align:start position:0%
need to spend a little bit more time on
it

01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
privately as the republicans and as
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
democrats thank you thank you
 
01:02:39.039 --> 01:02:42.710 align:start position:0%
democrats thank you thank you
representative

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i would encourage you all
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
to keep your eyes out for anything
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to change the economic
 
01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.829 align:start position:0%
that's going to change the economic
conditions

01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
that would result in our
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
revenues going one way to the other
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
and also this new stimulus package
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
once it's passed we need to understand
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
we get out of here early today
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
