00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What we're good Oh, he's good.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Good, everybody.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Thanks.

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Thanks.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.500
I'm going to be here today to make sure that the Senate colleagues had an opportunity to do some additional negotiating, I guess.

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:34.500
So at this point, the survey of the House members here, that position is still unchanged.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.000
So I'll ask the Senate if you have a change in your position.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500
We will accede to the House position.

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Okay.

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Then at this point, just so we understand what's next in line here, is when we adjourn the session I will meet with OLS inform them of our joint decision and then it's incumbent upon all seven of us to have a signature on those documents before the end of the day.

14
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:27.500
works okay great and i want to thank you for your patience okay committee members any comments this ends the uh conference on 1397 thank you all for being here.

15
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500
That was pretty quick.

16
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500
Thank you.
