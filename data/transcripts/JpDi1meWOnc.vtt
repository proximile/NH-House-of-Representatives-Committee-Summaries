members of the committee for the record
 
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Jim kofalt I represent
 
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County District 32 uh
 
00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of Wilton Temple
 
00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
switch um many of you may recognize this
 
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 align:start position:0%
as um the same bill word for word as
 
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 396 which last year passed
 
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
both chambers of the
 
00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 align:start position:0%
legislature um and was vetoed by the
 
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
governor this bill essentially addresses
 
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.869 align:start position:0%
governor this bill essentially addresses
three

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
situations um that are um I think
 
00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
subject to uh quite a lot of discussion
 
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
in concern with respect to uh our
 
00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
current um laws regarding discrimination
 
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
and those three situations are intimate
 
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
spaces meaning bathrooms and locker
 
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
rooms houses of
 
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
Correction and athletic competitions or
 
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
certain certain athletic competitions um
 
00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
strength what this bill does essentially
 
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
is to say that um our our current law
 
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know if this were to pass our law
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
would not consider separation of
 
00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
biological Sexes under those uh three
 
00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
situations to be
 
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
discriminatory it does not require the
 
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
separation of sexes so unlike House Bill
 
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 align:start position:0%
125 which we passed last year and has
 
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
been challenged in the courts uh this
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
does not mandate the separation um of uh
 
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
bathrooms locker rooms prisons and
 
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
sporting competitions uh based on
 
00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 align:start position:0%
biological sex house bill 125 was
 
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
limited to sporting competitions but it
 
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
did actually mandate the separation of
 
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
sexes so uh just to give an example what
 
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
this does do is it allows um school
 
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
districts for
 
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
example to distinguish between
 
00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 align:start position:0%
biological males and biological females
 
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 align:start position:0%
with respect to athletic
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
competitions a school district might
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
decide that that is entirely appropriate
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
for high school students who are uh
 
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
competing for potentially for
 
00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
scholarships um or competing for state
 
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
championships or where there may be
 
00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
actually uh some some physical dangers
 
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
involved with um you know Stronger
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
Faster biological males um competing in
 
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
females the same school district might
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
decide that for intramural sports or for
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
um you know for
 
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
some Middle School sports or Elementary
 
00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
School sports that there's really no
 
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 align:start position:0%
need to make those distinctions so it's
 
00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's left um to a a a local school board
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
or Administration under those
 
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances to set reasonable
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
practical guidelines to make sure that
 
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
um everybody can work together and play
 
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
together with mutual
 
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
respect having served on a school board
 
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
and having served as a chair of a school
 
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.430 align:start position:0%
and having served as a chair of a school
board

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
um I have seen that school boards are
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
often in a very precarious
 
00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.629 align:start position:0%
often in a very precarious
position

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
um in my own experience there were a
 
00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
number of transgender students who um
 
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
did not necessarily want to call
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
attention to um their differences they
 
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
attention to um their differences they
wanted

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
to uh work well with everyone they
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
wanted everyone to get along and they
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
were willing to um work together with
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
the administration to make sure that
 
00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
everybody's concerns were addressed
 
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
adequately at the same time we have seen
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
situations where that has not been in
 
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
the case two years ago uh when we held
 
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
the hearing for House Bill 396 we heard
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
from a mother in
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
Milford who um very tearfully told the
 
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee at the time about
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
her own experience as a survivor of
 
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
sexual violence all I want to do she
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
said is protect my 12-year-old
 
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
girl in that particular instance there
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
was a biological male in Milford
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
considerably older than this woman's
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
daughter who was routinely going into
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
the girls locker room um watching the
 
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
younger girls as they were getting
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
undressed as they were getting changed
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
and making fun of
 
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
them um this biological male
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
interestingly had a had a
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
girlfriend um but claimed that he was
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
trans transgender and um that that gave
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
him license to um to to have free reign
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the girls bathrooms and locker rooms
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
um I have had people Express a concern
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill is transphobic I've had
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
people Express a concern that uh there
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
is an underlying belief that transgender
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
people are um inherently
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
predatory I absolutely do not believe
 
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
that I have never said that
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
and I have never implied that what I
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
will say is that this provides a
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
loophole for people who may not actually
 
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
present themselves as transgender at
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
all to gain access to
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
spaces um that practically speaking they
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.309 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
so unlike some other bills uh I
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned House Bill 125 that sort of
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
mandate the separation of sexes
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
um in sports or others other proposals
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
that would have mandated the separation
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
of sexes in bathrooms and locker rooms
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
this bill simply
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
says there is discretion School Board
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
should not be subject to
 
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
lawfare um threats from special interest
 
00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
groups they should not be
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
um sort of put between a rock and a hard
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
place as the Milford school board was uh
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
the Milford school board at one point
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
took the um the sort of the baffling
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
position of covering up the urinals in
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
the boy room so that um every student
 
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
would be using a stall when they go to
 
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.629 align:start position:0%
would be using a stall when they go to
the

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:15.110 align:start position:0%
the
bathroom

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
um as a society we are navigating
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
territory that we have not uh really had
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
to navigate before I am a firm believer
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
that we ought to respect Everyone by
 
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
virtue of their
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
and this bill quite honestly is you know
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
I have positioned it before and I will
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
continue to position it as this is the
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
can't we can't we all get a long Bill
 
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:43.959 align:start position:0%
and so um it is with that uh spirit that
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
I put forward House Bill 148 and um that
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
ends my testimony uh Mr chairman I will
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
take questions any questions
 
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.110 align:start position:0%
take questions any questions
representative

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
Horgan well this is a pretty basic
 
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
question and you're talking about uh
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
biological sex um well terms you didn't
 
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
use were gender identity and gender
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
expression but and there SP lacks a
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
definition of biological sex so what do
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
you think it is and why does that matter
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
more than the person's gender identity
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
or gender expression so I just or does
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
it matter more than their gender
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
identity or gender expression so you're
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
because you do seem to does seem to
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
contemplate like forcing people to use
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know facilities or do things other
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
than what they would do they're based on
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
Expressions I'm not sure what the
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
question is exactly well right well
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's no maybe I'll just start with
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
the basic one biological sex so like
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
what there's no definition of the bill
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
so what exactly is it so thank you for
 
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
the question representative so I I I
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
have had people pose the question
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
um of whether we ought to whether I
 
00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
ought to have um
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
set out to Define biological sexs in the
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh practically speaking I think we
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
know what what males and females are we
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
have known that for thousands of years I
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
don't see a need to Define it and
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
um so I have chosen not to include that
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
TR yeah thanks and thanks for taking the
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
question I guess it's somewhat related
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
maybe to the question that
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative haran just asked um
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
I look at biological definitions of sex
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
and I see at least four possible ways
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
that you could do it which can be
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
different at different points in
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
people's lives and can also be different
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
at the same point in people's lives and
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
I'll list them and I wonder if you could
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
react to each of them
 
00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:53.230 align:start position:0%
react to each of them
chromosomes

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
chromosomes
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
gonads hormones and sex secondary sexual
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
characteristics those are more possible
 
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
ways I can imagine I'm wondering without
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
a definition how might anyone use this
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
bill to um make
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
policy thank you for the question
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
so again I think there there is
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
a your
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
your your question implies that there's
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
confusion as to male and female and I
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
would assert once again I really do not
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
believe that that is the case
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
I think that we know what a biological
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
male is I think we know what a
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
biological female is and that there are
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
um some extraordinary cases that don't
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
clearly medically speaking don't clearly
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
fall into one category or
 
00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
another to that I would say go back to
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
what I said before which is that this
 
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
bill um allows discretion and
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
latitude for local policy makers to
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
clarify those things for their own
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
purposes and set a policy that everyone
 
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
can live
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
with any other questions representative
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
question do you agree that we cannot
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
provide equity for 100% of people 100%
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
of the time but we're obligated as a
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
society to provide safety for the
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
majority especially in sensitive
 
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.230 align:start position:0%
majority especially in sensitive
situations

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I think
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
that you know as I have talked about
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
this bill I have sometimes
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned um the need to protect young
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
girls in
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
particular that's probably influenced by
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
the story of the Milford mom that I
 
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.230 align:start position:0%
the story of the Milford mom that I
mentioned

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
earlier I did get an email from someone
 
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
who said young boys are concerned about
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
their privacy and modesty as
 
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.550 align:start position:0%
their privacy and modesty as
well

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
um so understanding that we have
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
different different needs um
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
different priorities um as
 
00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
individuals there is no way we can
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
legislate respect for other
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
people um I I wish that we could but we
 
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.389 align:start position:0%
people um I I wish that we could but we
can't

00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
um I always strive to treat people with
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
respect by virtue of their Humanity and
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
I urge everyone else to do the same
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
thing as far as um safety is concerned I
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
think there are potential safety
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
issues not necessarily as I said it it
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be someone who who is
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
who truly identifies as transgender
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can be someone who has
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
really makes no pretense of identifying
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
as transgender except for the purposes
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
of accessing spaces that they should not
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
be in and I think those are the kinds of
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
things that we need to create some kind
 
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.829 align:start position:0%
things that we need to create some kind
of

00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism some latitude to make
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable sensible policies um to avoid
 
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
those those kind of
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
situations thank
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
you representative Horgan uh hold on one
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
second representative rmo thank you for
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I you referenced Governor senu VTO
 
00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:23.759 align:start position:0%
from last year and I was thinking about
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
that earlier too because he had in
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
particular mentioned as Vito that HB
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
396 was seeking to solve problems that
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
had not presented themselves in New
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in his opinion and was
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
inviting unnecessary Discord as you said
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
the bill is the same now I am not
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
hearing from my community that there
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
have been um incidents or or concerns
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
about men coming into women's bathrooms
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
or vice versa can you tell I know you
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
saided the example of the Milford T can
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
you tell me where this concern other
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
instances where this is coming from
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question so I'm
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
aware of at least three school districts
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
where it has it has become a major issue
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh karge is one um Milford is one and
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
msic School District which is in my
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
district is also one
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
um I have also heard from legislators in
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
the state house that they have felt
 
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable using bathrooms in the
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
state house because there was a person
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
of the opposite sex in the bathroom with
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
them and were those a followup but we're
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
going to follow up goe and were those
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
instances where those were transgender
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
individuals who
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
were the other people felt uncomfortable
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
with um I in in the latter case I don't
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually know the details I just I have
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
heard someone say that it has been an
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
issue for them I have heard others
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
affirm that and I at least four or five
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
others say yes that has been an issue
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
and a concern as well you're trying to
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
address that with this bill I'm I'm
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
address generally speaking I'm trying to
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
address the the problem that we have no
 
00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:14.150 align:start position:0%
address the the problem that we have no
recourse

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
recourse
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
when someone creates one of these
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
situations um there there's no there's
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
no latitude for reasonable judgment
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
there's no latitude for creating
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
policies where we all get along what
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
happens instead is um outside groups
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
tend to come into these school districts
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
and threaten lawsuits and it puts school
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
boards in a very very uncomfortable
 
00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
situation so I don't know what uh what
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
policy would ensue uh at the State House
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
for example if this were to pass um but
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
I do know that it is a a serious concern
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
that has been expressed by a number of
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%

Alice Wade I represent straford district
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
15 do Ward 2 I strongly oppose this bill
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
because it serves no legitimate public
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
benefit and only serves to harass trans
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
people for existing I myself am a trans
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
woman and I'm going to bet that most of
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
you would not have known that unless I
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
had told you all of my documents say
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
female I have had bottom surgery I have
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
had voice therapy and I've been
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
transitioning for over six years now
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
just this morning I used the women's
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
restroom down that
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
Hall no issues I have used the's
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
restroom for six years in public no
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
disruptions no one has ever called me
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
out for it or anything but even if I did
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
not pass as a ciswoman I would still
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
deserve to use the restroom and public
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
in peace just like everyone else if
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement let's pretend that this law
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
passes in some County decides that they
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
want to implement this and to prevent
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
trans women from using the restroom how
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
are we checking your original birth
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
certificate at the door nobody brings
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
those around anywhere you know are we
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
talking genital inspections for anybody
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
to enter a restroom and how is that in
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
anyone's best
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
interest if you truly believe in the
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
goal of this law even if you do you
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
should not vote to pass it unless you
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
can clearly answer the question on how
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
this would be enforced in Florida people
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
risk felony charges for using the
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
restroom in Texas there are counties
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
that offer $10,000 bounties on trans
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
people's heads for using the
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
restroom if this law passes a county
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
could Implement that here in New
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are travel advisories
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
for Trans people I cannot go to Florida
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
even on vacation I cannot move there for
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
work because it would be illegal for me
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
to live there in
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
public yourself in my shoes imagine
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
there's a padlock on every public
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
restroom and you have to hold it in for
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
eight hours that is unreasonable it is
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
not fair to anyone and I'm happy to
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%

Durham which is straford County District
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
10 and um I strongly oppos this bill uh
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm the parent of two children my
 
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
children swam on the swim team they had
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
transgender athletes on the swim team
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
the kids all changed in the bathrooms
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
they took showers in the bathrooms they
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
all had individual stalls and used what
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
they needed to because kids don't like
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
to change in front of any other kid just
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
like adults generally don't like to

change their clothes in front of any
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
discriminatory um it I was listening to
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor talk about the woman
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
who believed her child was being
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
sexually harassed by an older male
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
person I would venture to say that it
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with the fact that
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
they were in the bathroom if there's a
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
cisgender male going into a girl's
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
bathroom and harassing young girls that
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
is not an issue about trans people
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's an issue about a cisgender male
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
or an older male harass ing a young girl
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
and there are legal actions that can be
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
taken when that happens if someone is
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
harassing or stalking you there are
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
legal actions and legal protections um
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of biological sex it's a label
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's been assigned to a person based
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
on a number of physical characteristics
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
or other characteristics but that
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
differentiation may happen at any time
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
at certain points in our lives we have
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
different levels of estrogen we have
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
different levels of testosterone I had a
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
very very very old gynecologist tell me
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
that as my body stops produc proding
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
estrogen I'll stop being female I'm
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
pretty sure I'm staying female my whole
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
life I haven't changed yet whether my
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
body produces estrogen or not you know I
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
I continue to be what I believe and know
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
to be myself I will say I used the stall
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
next to representative Wade earlier
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
today I had no problem about that as
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
long as she's not peeking in my stall
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
and I'm not peeking in her stall and we
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
can all pee in peace and wash our hands
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
and make sure we leave the bathroom neat
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's the important factor so if we
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
apologize representative that's your
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
time okay if we could please stop
 
00:23:59.470 --> 00:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
discrimin against people I would
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I oppose this bill okay
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
any questions seeing none thank you
 
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.750 align:start position:0%
any questions seeing none thank you

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
Harrington followed by
 
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:15.799 align:start position:0%
Rosemary is it
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
emic hi my name is Betsy Harrington I'm
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
from daring New Hampshire I'm here to
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
represent somebody who is experienced it
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
like for real my boys play soccer their
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
girlfriends play soccer too one
 
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
girlfriend refused to play this season
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
because there was a boy playing on the
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
other team at karge a boy playing
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
against the law it was violating state
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
law that child did not have an
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
injunction to play um so the girlfriend
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
refused to play five girls refuse to
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
play and it's really
 
00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:50.919 align:start position:0%
affecting the kids and so I'm here to
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
represent those kids who it really is
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
repres really who it is really affecting
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
I went to that game we played anyway we
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
had five JV girls go to that game and so
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
it was a complete blowout uh the the
 
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
game never even got towards the goal and
 
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
um the player is the goalie and so it
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
was really nothing ever happened it was
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
just a blowout and felt very unfair but
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
I found out the next day that the
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
player's father was a sex offender
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
violating his bail conditions at that
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
game and I feel like when you introduce
 
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
one breaking of the law it it says well
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
if they're going to break the law here I
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
can just totally break the law there too
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
and introduce more dangerous and so I
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
feel like we need to stick to the law
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
the law was that boys were not supposed
 
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
to be playing on girls designated teams
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
and yet we blurred it and allowed some
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
to play and it was I I don't want to
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
swear but like a show it was there
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
was media kids weren't playing kids were
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
upset it's just going to keep happening
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
if that's what we keep doing and it's
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
always going to be that c same kind of
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
show just crazy and bringing media and
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
kids won't play and drama and if we just
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
separate it by boys and girls it's
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
simple the way it's always been so I'm
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
just here to tell you it's been awful
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
and I would like it to go back to the
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
way it was we need this
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill i' be happy to answer questions any
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
scare uh Dear honorable members of the
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee my name is Rosie
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
Emer and I live in hooks at New
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today as a sister
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
cisgendered woman and as a parent of a
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
young trans child who oppose this
 
00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:50.919 align:start position:0%
bill um my child is non-binary and uses
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
they them pronouns um for them this
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
means that they don't feel like a girl
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
or a boy and this has made decisions
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
around bathrooms and changing rooms
 
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
pretty painstaking and very anxiety
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
provoking for my child and myself alike
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
um they have used the bathroom that
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
matches their assigned sex at Birth by
 
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:08.919 align:start position:0%
choice and have had to deal with
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable questions and harassment
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
and so this bill that you're proposing
 
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
is going to fix a problem that doesn't
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
exist and cause more problems for my
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
child uh American Pediatric um American
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
Association of Pediatrics put out a
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
study that says that bathroom
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions and locker room
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions actually lead to 1.2 to 2
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
and a half times more likelihood of
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
sexual assault for Trans uh and
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
non-binary folks and so this is not the
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
let's all get along bill that's not what
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's doing um my child uh who is 8 years
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
old wrote some testimony which I'd like
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
to read really quickly and then I'll be
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%

in hookit I'm a trans kid and since
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
transitioning it's been an entirely
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
different life it's been scarier because
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
some people don't understand what trans
 
00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
people are going through through but I
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
like it more than how it was before
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
before it felt like something was
 
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
missing and now I feel like me I like
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
being a trans skid I like that I've met
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%

to be able to use the bathroom that
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
makes me feel most safe I've had people
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
ask me why I'm in a certain bathroom
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's scary and makes me anxious and
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to answer questions about
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
what bathroom you're in and why you use
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
it people guess on how you look and
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
sound and sometimes they can be wrong I
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
think trans people should have the right
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%

important caveat I've got the same
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
concern as representative Horgan about
 
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
the lack of definition the Riley gains

because it's missing that and I suggest
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
and it's on the second page of my
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
testimony the definition for the

reproductive biology and genetics at
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
Birth the the sexual binary is an
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
objective reality each of us here is a
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
product of one small gam produced by a
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
male and one large gam Pro produced by a
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
female there's no other way humans can
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
reproduce sex isn't assigned at Birth
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
it's determined at conception and
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
observed with almost perfect accuracy at
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
Birth or earlier the fact that our
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
Medical Association say otherwise is a
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
testimony to their ideological
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
corruption but gender identity ities are
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
imaginary and based on emotions
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
stereotypes and circular reasoning
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
according to New Hampshire law gender
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
identity means I quote a person's gender
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
related identity and how do we know if
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
someone's transgender according to
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
former director of dartman cells
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
transgender health program John turko
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
quote there is only one test I know of
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
to determine gender identity and that is
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
to ask that person and so a gender
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
identity is a gender identity a
 
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
transgender person is someone who says
 
00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:32.519 align:start position:0%
he's transgender and a girl is someone
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
who says that he or she is a girl none
 
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
of this makes sense I've heard this the
 
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
LED fantasy that excluding males from
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
female spaces would require genital
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
inspections I can't take this seriously
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
when those selling the story have no
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
idea what a girl is and have already
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%

question about protecting the vast

majority of people so I pose this
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situation to
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
highlight the Injustice of this
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill it is far more likely that our
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
children will be sexually abused in
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
church than they will be sexually abused
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
in a bathroom by a trans
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
person if someone were to propose a bill
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
saying that anyone ident who identifies
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
as Christian should not be allowed to
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
use a bathroom because I knew somebody
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
once who said he was a Christian and he
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
sexually abused somebody we would all
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
agree that that was
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination now if you substitute
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
trans it's still
 
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.669 align:start position:0%

thousands we don't always look like the
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
gender in our underwear the only way to
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
police this is to sexually molest people
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
by checking their genitalia that is the
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
only way to police this are we willing

way a man should look when they enter a

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
me than their safety I am however deeply
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
concerned by the potential harm this
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill could cause instead of enhancing
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
safety it could create significant risks
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
one critical oversight is the failure to
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
recognize the existence of transgender
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
men should this bill pass transgender
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
men like myself would be forced to use
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
women's restrooms and locker rooms while
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
my voice May reveal my transgender
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
status my appearance rarely does meaning
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
any man whether transgender or not could
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
claim to be a transgender man to access
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
women's private spaces this raises
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
another pressing concern how would
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement of this bill work would
 
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
individuals be required to prove their
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
sex to access sex segregated spaces such
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
a policy would not only be impractical
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
but would also expose women and girls to
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
unnecessary harassment and invasive
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
questioning and private spaces this does
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
not sound like protection it sounds like
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
harm finally I must address the glaring
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
contradiction in the bill it claims that
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
the state is fundamentally committed to
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
treating all persons without
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination and with equal dignity
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
and respect but its Provisions would
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
effectively exclude transgender
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
individuals from public life denying
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
someone access to something as basic as
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
a restroom contradicts any genuine
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
commitment to the equality and freedom
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
it is inconsistent with the values we
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
hold dear in New Hampshire and is
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
Unworthy of our great state thank you
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
for your time and consideration I
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
strongly urge to oppose House Bill 148
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
for the sake of safety dignity and the
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
freedom of all Granite
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%

we and I am here in opposition to this
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill I have been in opposition to these
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
bills for the last seven eight years and
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
I have testified and I have sent studies
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
combating what some of the anti-trans
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
people are trying to pretend is
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
real before the last presidential
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
election we had a candidate who's now
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
our president who spent
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
222 million dollars to other the trans
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
Comm community and make them look like
 
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
evil people and that gives permission
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
for things to happen like the um you
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
stick to the bill that we're we're
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
speaking of here rather than I am this
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
bill this Bill gives people permission
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
to discriminate no matter what it says
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
it does and it also gives people
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
permission to go after transgender
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
people I don't know if you read it
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
should have been on the front page of
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
every paper about the young man who was
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
tortured and killed by five people a
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
young transgender man was tortured for
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
two months
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
we had a speaker
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
earlier who thought it was okay to bring
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
up the legal status of a transgender
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
woman that kind of hate should not stand
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't allow it to stand please
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
listen to the testimony please do some
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
research on what transgender really is
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
and what interex is and how different
 
00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
some people are and mostly let's be
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
kind thank you thank you any
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
fredman good
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for taking the time to
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
hear public testimony on HB 148 today my
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
name is Sarah Terell I am Al lifelong
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire I was
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly proud when in 2018 our state
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
came together to pass strong
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination protections ensuring
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
no one could be denied dignity and
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
safety based on age sex gender identity
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
race Creed color marital status familial
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
status disability or a national origin
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
that was a moment of progress and
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
Humanity today I am horrified that HB
 
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
148 seeks to strip those protections
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
from one of our most vulnerable
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
populations my daughter is transgender
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
she is 16 years old and like any
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
teenager she is busy navigating School
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
driver's education Sports and her first
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
job she faces the same challenges as her
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
peers homework friendships and planning
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
for the future what she should not have
 
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
to face is additional fear and anxiety
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
imposed on her by her own state
 
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
government like everyone else she just
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
wants to use a restroom or locker room
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
in peace she wants to get in do what she
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
needs to do and get out she's not a
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
predator the implication that
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
transgender people are a danger by
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
default is both offensive and false HB
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
148 will not protect privacy or safety
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
it will do the exact opposite forcing
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
transgender people into spaces where
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
they clearly do not belong puts them at
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
risk my daughter has long hair she wears
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
butterfly sweatshirts paints her nails
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
and loves lip gloss I cannot imagine a
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
world where she or anyone in a men's
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
restroom would feel comfortable or safe
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
if she were to forced to walk in she
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
does not want to pass by Men At urinals
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
any more than they want a young woman
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
walking by them we all agree that
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
discrimination is wrong the bipartisan
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
support for New Hampshire's 2018
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law proved that HB
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
148 is a step backward
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary harmful and an insult
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
to the very principles of fairness and
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
dignity that we uphold transgender
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
people are people they deserve to be
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
treated with the same respect and
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
Humanity as anyone else they are not a
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
threat just because of who they are
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
please help me keep my child safe vote
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
itl on HB 148 thank you thank you if you
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
have a written testimony that you want
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
you Aubrey fredman followed by the
 
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.910 align:start position:0%
you Aubrey fredman followed by the
caleff

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
bitler uh Mr chairman committee members
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh Aubrey Friedman I live in Bridgewater
 
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:10.559 align:start position:0%
I speak in support of this bill so let's
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
talk about the prisons and the detention
 
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
facilities I'd say that's the biggest
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
area of concern here uh if the state is
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to incarcerate women then it is
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for the safety of those
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
women and if you have a a biological
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
maale that somehow gets into the prison
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know under you know the guys of
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
well they get in there uh there could be
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
abuse and it's really a safety issue and
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
actually the taxpayer would be on the
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
hook so I'd say that is the the biggest
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
concern here is uh safety in uh uh
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
detention facilities should keep
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
separate um as far as the uh changing
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
rooms and all that kind of stuff um I
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
know it's uh they share they in like in
 
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
Europe they do share changing rooms men
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
and women that's not that uncommon uh
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
but that's Europe this is America and
 
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
here we're still kind of separate on
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
that and a man probably wouldn't care
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
actually if a woman uh goes into the uh
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
men's changing room or whatever but I
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
think many women do not like that they
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
feel like that's an invasion of their
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
space and let's honor their privacy and
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
that's those are the reasons I support
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you thank you any
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
questions at all seeing none thank you
 
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.510 align:start position:0%
questions at all seeing none thank you
thank

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
you Michaela
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
Irwin good morning members of the House
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee for the record my
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
name is Michaela Fishler and I'm from
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm here to express my
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
opposition to house spill 148 as a spill
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
allows for public and private
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
institutions to discriminate against
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
transgender individuals to begin I want
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
to point out the fact that when it comes
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
to bathroom and locker room use
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
requiring individuals to use one
 
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
corresponding to their sex assigned
 
00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
birth rather than their current gender
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
identity or presentation your mandating
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
scenarios where someone who looks like a
 
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
man now must enter a women's restroom
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
because they were assigned female at
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
Birth and someone who looks like a woman
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
now must enter a men's restroom because
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
they were assigned male at Birth that
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
goes against any argument for safety and
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
comfort for anyone involved I don't want
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
to go into a men's restroom and trans
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
women get assaulted by men as well I
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
also want to bring up the third
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
circumstance proposed in this bill the
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
biological sex classification and
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities Bill claims the
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
policy changes will protect the privacy
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
and safety but it would should be
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear that forcibly placing
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
transgender individuals in with those
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
that share their so-called biological
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
sex POS an immense privacy and
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
especially safety risk to them this bill
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
throughout devalues the privacy and
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
safety of transgender individuals but
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
this specific case tops the rest
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
additionally the inclusion of mental
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
health institutions feels especially
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
callous as taking extra vulnerable
 
00:45:58.549 --> 00:45:58.559 align:start position:0%
individuals and putting them in hostile
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
situations is
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
abusive as a wise old Jedi once said
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
fear is the path to the dark side fear
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
leads to anger anger leads to hate hate
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
leads to suffering bills like this Stoke
 
00:46:10.109 --> 00:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
any existing fears and anger Paving the
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
way for legitimizing hate and
 
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
legislating suffering instead of
 
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:14.839 align:start position:0%
perpetuating the cycle I encourage
 
00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
everyone to remember transgender people
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
are human beings just like them if
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
you're afraid just try and understand if
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
you're confused just ask and we can all
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
talk this isn't the end of civilized
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
society none of this is new to humanity
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
we can handle this thank you thank you
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
any questions seeing none thank
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
you Lauren
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
jaos thank you members of the committee
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Lauren Irwin I've lived in
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for more than 30 years I'm
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
an employment attorney with the law firm
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
of Upton and Hatfield based here in
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
conquer I strongly oppose this Bill
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity for
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
letting me speak about
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
it I oppose this bill because it takes
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
away existing legal protections and
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
rights for transgender people in New
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I also am the parent of a
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
transgender child in 2018 only seven
 
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
years ago this this the legislature
 
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
passed and the governor signed into law
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
a bill that specifically added gender
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
identity as a protected class this was a
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
done on a bipartisan basis and signed by
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
Republican governor sonunu in the
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
process of passing that law I want to
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to the fact that
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
the house Judiciary Committee this
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
committee at the time issued a majority
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
committee report in which describing the
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill it stated that the
 
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
bill would add gender identity to New
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's existing Human Rights Act
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
which at the time already uh included
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
the other categories the report goes on
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
to State and I've given copies for
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
everyone in this committee I've
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
submitted that this morning it would
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
prohibit discrimination in employment
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
housing public spaces such as
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants businesses hospitals based
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
on gender identity it was noted that the
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
committee had heard many cases of actual
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination from transgender
 
00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:05.079 align:start position:0%
individuals and that the bill was
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
supported by employment attorneys the
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission and the
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
Bia in addition the committee heard
 
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
support from the chiefs of Police
 
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
Association who explained that the bill
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
explicitly says that a person's gender
 
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
identity cannot be asserted for an
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
improper purpose such as using a
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
bathroom or locker room to commit a
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
crime we still have our Criminal
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
protections here in New Hampshire with
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
our existing law the committee explained
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
that they heard testimony about the high
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
rate of preventable suicide in the
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
transgender Community noting that a
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
staggering 41% of transgender people
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
reported attempting suicide compared to
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
1.6% in the general
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
population extra time I apologize I urge
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
you to oppose this bill I've represented
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
transgender people they are very
 
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
valuable members of the new ire
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
all it's a practical question so
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
looking looking for your testimony email
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
streams so I guess both Lauren and Irwin
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
are names that have multiple spellings
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
so which spelling should I be searching
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
for oh sure uh l a u r n i r w i n i met

Committee I stand in strong opposition
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
to HB 148 this mean-spirited Bill allows
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination in restrooms against
 
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:22.760 align:start position:0%

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
successful effort to update New
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's law against discrimination
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%

people in employment housing and public
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
the seven years since the
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination law passed there have
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
been no uptick in safety incidents in
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
restrooms many times over in 2018 people
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
who know and love transgender people had
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
to State time and time again the simple
 
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
obvious fact that we all care about
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
safety and privacy in restrooms
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
including transgender people there is no
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
evidence to support otherwise
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
villainizing our community when we are
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
not the predators in the bathroom is
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
fueling a long-standing anti-lgbtq
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
stereotype at one 2017 meeting I helped
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
organize between constituents and one
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
state representative that state
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative stated that he was afraid
 
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
of trans women in the restroom and the
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
psychologist constituent explained how
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
important it is for all of us to talk
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
back to our unfounded fears I am asking
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
this committee to do the same I suspect
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
the authors of this bill did not
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
explicitly Target employment
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
discrimination because they knew it
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
would be incredibly unpopular and also
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
con unconstitutional as the Supreme
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
Court ruled that employment
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
discrimination against gay and
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
transgender people is unlawful sex
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
discrimination however this bill is an
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
employment discrimination bill because
 
00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
restrooms cannot be separated from
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
employment if employers are allowed to
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
discriminate in restrooms their
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
transgender employees cannot safely use
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
the restrooms at their job jobs what if
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
every job a transgender person is
 
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
applying to allows discrimination where
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
is the transgender employee supposed to
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
go for all people including transgender
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
people being able to use the restroom is
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
essential to being able to navigate all
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
parts of public life how will this
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's your time I'll email a longer
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
version of the committee um of my
 
00:52:17.549 --> 00:52:17.559 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee happy to take
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr
 
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
chairman you indicate that there is a
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
problem with this language under
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
employment law as I read this language
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
this new language imposes no new uh
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
strictures and impositions on uh private
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
employers so can you explain to me how
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
there could be any issue under
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
employment law uh and it's entirely a
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
matter for those employers is it not by
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
saying that anyone May discriminate
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
against transgender people in the
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
restroom um that is allowing employers
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
to potentially discriminate in restrooms
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
and places of employment for both
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
employees and um and people that
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
frequent their business um from the
 
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
outside thank
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions seeing
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
none thank you and again I apologize for
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
the two-minute limit but if you have
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
testimony you want to email to us
 
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
afterwards we'll certainly take it we
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
encourage it Bren
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
nus that's going to be followed by cerra
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
muns thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
my name is Bren ninos I am a excuse me I
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
am a mother of
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
three and um the value of treating all
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
persons without discrimination and with
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
equal dignity and respect is
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
fundamentally at odds with classifying
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
biological sex in terms of access to
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
laboratory facilities or locker rooms
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
athletic or sporting events and in our
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
institutions as a cisgender woman I do
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
not feel unsafe if a transwoman uses the
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
same bath bathroom or facilities as I do
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
as a parent I do not feel my cisgender
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
children will be unsafe if they share a
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
bathroom or a facility or sports teams
 
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
with a child who is trans I feel
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
strongly that trans people will be
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
deeply harmed by exclusion when they
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
cannot use the bathroom the locker they
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
cannot participate in the sports knowing
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
that I am not at risk at all when a
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
transperson fully participates in all
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
the same activities to which cisgender
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
adults and children have a right to
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
participate and knowing that a trans
 
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
child who is excluded isolated or denied
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
dignity is far more likely to engage in
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
risk-taking behaviors per the family
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
acceptance project we should consider
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
the safety and well-being of all
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
children through fostering inclusion and
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
acceptance over fear and exclusion
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%

co-workers family members and fellow
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire all of whom
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
share a simple yet profound desire to
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
live free in our Granite State this bill
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
however runs counter to the very values
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
that have long defined the granite state
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
the transgender Community has always
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
been here accessing public facilities
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
that align with their gender identity
 
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
without issue it was only in recent
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
years that extremist groups and farri
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
political leaders began to scapegoat and
 
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
vilify trans individuals inciting a
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
social Panic through deceptive
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
accusations aimed at erasing their very
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
existence I ask you how do we en enforce
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
restroom classifications based on
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
biological sex without resorting to
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and discriminatory
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
practices how is how is to decide how
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
biological sex is defined and policed
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
moreover how can mental health
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
professionals provide compassionate
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
effective care while dismissing a
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
patient's identity how can they uphold
 
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
their duty to do no harm when over
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
700,000 transgender students have
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
succumbed to Suicide not because of who
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
they are but because Society has
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
legislated their rights dignity and very
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
existence away gender dysphoria is
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
recognized as a legitimate mental health
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
condition in the diagnostic and
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
statistical Manual of mental disorders
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
also known as the dsm5 so how can we
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
possibly claim to protect mental health
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
while invalidating the very individual
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
seeking care the the Stark reality is is
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
that we cannot instead this bill
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
threatens to incite further violence
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
against transgender individuals and dis
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
dismantle critical protections against
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on gender identity
 
00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
I want a New Hampshire where every
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
person is free to build their own life
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
no one uh not one where the government
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
dictates the validity of their existence
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
disturbingly during the time I have
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
spoken an estimated 13 to 24 transgender
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
Americans have attempted suicide okay
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%

00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.589 align:start position:0%
questions at all seeing none thank you

01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%

good
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
morning this is for submission in
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 148 as the
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
mother of an incredibly wonderful
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
intelligent and kind transgender adult
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
son from this supposed Live Free or Die
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
State I take issue with those who try to
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
diminish legislate or outright ban his
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
mere existence forgive me for being
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
under the impression that our
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
constitution grants all of its citizens
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
equal protection under the law complete
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
with unalienable rights freedoms and
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
liberties with unalienable meaning
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
impossible to give away or to take away
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
or give up as a former teacher and small
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
business owner I was very fortunate to
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
meet a variety of adults families and
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
children from all walks of life My
 
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
Religion taught me to be kind
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
compassionate and to help the less
 
01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:35.559 align:start position:0%
fortunate and for that I am
 
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
grateful Society is often unkind to and
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
judgmental about individuals who are
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
quote unquote
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
different I make it a point to learn
 
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
about topics with which I am famili
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar and no little about excluding
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
groups of people because they don't
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
conform to our pre determined
 
01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
expectations and biases is petty wrong
 
01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:03.549 align:start position:0%
expectations and biases is petty wrong
and

01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
immoral with respect to houseal Bill 148
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
I read that a whopping
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
.8% of athletes are
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
transgender given all the pressing
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
issues and challenges in our society why
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
is this even being
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
legislated it's precisely this kind of
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
Bill and narrow-mindedness that promotes
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
and fuels existing culture
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
Wars reality and statistics tell us the
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
trans population is already the target
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
of bullying threats and heinous actions
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
I apologize that's your time that's my
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
time that's your time yes is that two
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
minutes any
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
questions New Hampshire you are better
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
than this thank you Karen Danielle
 
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.230 align:start position:0%
than this thank you Karen Danielle
Danielle

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
you don't need to speak okay Vivian
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
Reid thank you for this opportunity to
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
speak my name is Vivian Murphy I'm from
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
Rochester New Hampshire and many of the
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have more eloquently
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
said what I was going to say so I will
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
as you ask narrow this
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
down part of the problem I think is
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
people that support this build they do
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
not see us and I'm speaking as a
 
01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:40.839 align:start position:0%
transgender woman as women because of a
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
genetic anomaly you assume that we are
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
men and you expect us to act like men
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
that thought process by itself is pretty
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
sad and
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
damning this bill seems punitive and
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
vindictive we less than 1% as was
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
alluded to of the population it also
 
01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:04.839 align:start position:0%
seems that it's fixated on trans women
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
we have had a few trans men here to
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
testify and I thank them for their
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
bravery and being
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
here um we are not transitioning to
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
something we are shedding the lies that
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
our bodies tell and finally being who we
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
are meant to
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
be biological classifications do exist
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
XX XY xxy xxy y all manners of
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
variations which is why sex isn't
 
01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
classified as binary you can't have a
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
binary classification system with more
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
than two configurations even if they are
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
the dominant
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
configurations all we're asking for is
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
our constitutional promise of life
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
liberty and the pursuit of
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
happiness yet we're demonized
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
dehumanized legislated against
 
01:04:59.789 --> 01:04:59.799 align:start position:0%
physically attacked emotionally attacked
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
and tortured our beloved State touts its
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
motto Live Free or Die with what little
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
time I have left on this Earth I plan to
 
01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.029 align:start position:0%
time I have left on this Earth I plan to
do

01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
that I guess that's all I have to say
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
that's your time anyway so that's I
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
jocks good morning members of the
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee uh for the record my
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
name is Courtney Reid I serve as policy
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
Advocate with the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
and I'm speaking in opposition to this
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh primarily because HB
 
01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
148 permits
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh with an ultimate
 
01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
effect of making transgender people
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
unsafe and unwelcome in public
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
life this bill with no clear enforcement
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism threatens the policing of
 
01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
bodies and emboldens individuals to act
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
cruelty in stores schools workplaces and
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
other Civic spaces and unfortunately it
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
means that we would undo meaningful
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisan work done only several years
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
ago that made our state more inclusive
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
and welcoming and all of that in
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
disregard of long-standing
 
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
hardfought anti-discrimination laws at
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
level I want to Echo some of the data
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
that was brought forward about how when
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
we have inclusive policies ones that
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
allow individuals to access the restroom
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
that aligns with their gender we see
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
reductions in rates of assault uh and
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
violence specifically on transgender
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
women and when the inverse is true when
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
we have bills like this in place where
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
individuals can't access facilities that
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
they need we actually see increased
 
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
rates of assault and violence and so
 
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
again I think this begs the question of
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of this bill is because
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
there is nothing unsafe or invasive
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
about a transgender person accessing a a
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
facility and we're claiming a right to
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
privacy in public spaces that are not
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
private um certainly there are questions
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
about how this bill would conflict with
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh Federal protections like title 7
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
barring I apologize but that's your time
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
sure are there any question take
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony could you
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
explain in list listening to to your
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I didn't hear anything that
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
you said that was in conflict with the
 
01:08:04.269 --> 01:08:04.279 align:start position:0%
testimony that the the prime sponsor
 
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative kofar presented this
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
morning so could you explain what it is
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
about his his testimony and his bill
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
that you take issue
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
with thank you for the question
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative um if there's a specific
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
point I would appreciate an elaboration
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
but I
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
can talk through that the key point I'll
 
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
simplify my question is there something
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
specific in what representative cofort
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
said this morning that you would
 
01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:33.550 align:start position:0%
said this morning that you would
disagree

01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
with I don't recall thank you for the
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
followup I don't recall a a specific
 
01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
point of the sponsor's testimony that I
 
01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
can speak to but uh the aclu's position
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
to this bill is that it fundamentally
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
would permit discrimination against
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
transgender people in different areas of
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
life in violation of title 7 in Title 9
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
and the pr prison rape elimination act
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
they're also constitutional concerns
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
regarding 14th Amendment equal
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
protection rights and eth Amendment
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
rights uh about cruel and unusual
 
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
punishment in prisons and jails and when
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
policies like this have been challenged
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
or inclusive policies have been
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
challenged the courts overwhelmingly
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
have cited in favor that these policies
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
violate Title 9 and title 7
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan um thank you very
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
much I was looking over your written
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
testimony you referred to the
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
transgender offender manual put up by
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Prisons and I know that's
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
an issue for correctional facilities at
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
all levels and
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh probably shouldn't say this by I know
 
01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
the the former State ref who's in a
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
federal prison for what our horrific
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
crimes I'm pretty sure she doesn't want
 
01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
to be in either gender's federal prison
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
or state prison but um I haven't spoken
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
to her since she was incarcerated but is
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
there a question here yes the question
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
is is this transgender offend of manual
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
as far as you and you may not know this
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
is this still still being used is this
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
one of the many things in in the the
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
federal government many federal
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
government things that have been
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
disrupted by the events of the last
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
month or
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh in the testimony uh
 
01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
I've cited the New Hampshire Department
 
01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
of Corrections policy which uses those
 
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines uh and follows um a
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
case by casee assessment of where to
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
place transgender individuals
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
considering their own safety risks this
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
is the federal policy as well uh after
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
the recent executive order um about uh
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
trans transgender inmates housing
 
01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
placements this has been challenged in
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
the courts and they're actually has been
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
um a temporary restraining order placed
 
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
in in light of that uh executive order
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
noting that when that EO was rolled out
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
there actually were no legitimate claims
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
of violence or safety concerns uh that
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
were raised by the federal department of
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
corrections and um you can see that in
 
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
my testimony but I'm happy to highlight
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
that in a follow-up email okay thank you
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
thanks representative tur yeah thank you
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking the question um my
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
reading of this bill um suggests that uh
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
as was stated before um the definition
 
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
of how uh biological sex would be
 
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
defined is wide open and as as the as
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
the co- sponsor said you know based on
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
perception um the bill also seems to
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
allow that definition to be
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
applied uh without any constraints as to
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
how the definition would interact with
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
um the processes of you know prisons and
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and sports um I guess my
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
question is do you agree with those two
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
things and do you know of any other law
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
in our state that um is open to
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your question I just
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
want to uh make sure I'm understanding
 
01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.709 align:start position:0%
want to uh make sure I'm understanding
right

01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
um am I aware of any other state law
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
that permits segregation based on
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
biological sex in this way of this
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
bill that allows segregation of people
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
based on an an an non-specifically
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
defined um of parameters or and doesn't
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
prescribe how that definition would be
 
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
applied thank you for your question
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative to my knowledge I am not
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
aware of any bill that does this aside
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
from the current uh uh Sports band
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's being challenged in the courts
 
01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.270 align:start position:0%
that's being challenged in the courts
right

01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%

restroom that people do not have a right
 
01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.870 align:start position:0%
restroom that people do not have a right
to

01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
privacy thank you for your uh your
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
question representative Perez uh I had
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
stated that
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
individuals in support of this bill are
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
claiming a right to privacy in spaces
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
that are not private that means shared
 
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
facilities and that is actually coming
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
from a ruling out of the third circuit
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
where an inclusive policy was uh
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
challenged and was actually struck was
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
upheld uh on grounds of privacy and I'm
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
happy to relay the uh the ruling for you
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
from the third
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
circuit any other questions seeing none
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%

my name is m Jac I'm a 17-year-old girl
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
from new and a junior at kirar Regional
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
High School and I'm here to testify an
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
hp48 I'm a teenager trying to live my
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
life and go through the day at school
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
doing my school workor talking with my
 
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
friends and playing sports with them
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
despite this I am pered as a threat for
 
01:14:14.669 --> 01:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
no reason other than the utilization of
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
fear as a political tactic throughout
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
the day I sometimes need to use the
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
bathroom like any other student this is
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
nothing but a normal part of my day I
 
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
use the bathroom and I am gone no harm
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
done to anyone else and no one's privacy
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
is compromised Banning me from the
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
restroom does nothing but pin me as a
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
pariah in school using the male restroom
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
would be dangerous because as the entire
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
School knows and has known for years
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
that I am not a male in the male
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
restroom I would face bullying for my
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
identity not to mention the
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
psychological harm by being forced to be
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
someone I'm not the same applies to
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
locker rooms whether using them before a
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
gym class or a sport I may face the same
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
issues or even but even worse school is
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
where I spend a lot of my time and
 
01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
separating me from my peers in locker
 
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
rooms and sports does nothing but harm
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
my development socially and permit
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination against kids like me
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
something which should be unacceptable
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
if we are truly meant to Live Free or
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
Die being transgender is not a choice I
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
made I was born this way and it will
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
always be who I am the only choice I've
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
made is to be myself something which is
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
increasingly hard as laws in the nation
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
like this pass making our state and
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
Country an inhospitable place for
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
transgender people respecting me for who
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
I am does not cost anyone anything just
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%

01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
testimony of a high school student at
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%

you to go to the top
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
dear members of the House Judiciary
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
Committee I felt it was important for me
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
to First Express how to how aggravating
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
it is to have to be writing this letter
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
of opposition right now instead of doing
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
my actual homework but I leave the I
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
believe that protecting my trans nine
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
binary and other gender non-conforming
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
friends is more important and you should
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
too with that being said please oppose
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
and vote down HB 148 you see the only
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
thing I and the other
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
lgbtqia plus youth around me want is to
 
01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
live our lives in peace without the
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
concern of being discriminated against
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
by our peers let alone by the government
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
as I see it HB 148 would open the
 
01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
floodgates to more anti-trans
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
legislation as it allows classifications
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
on the basis of biological sex this
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
means my trans and non-binary friends
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
have to be worried about where they can
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
use the restroom and where they can
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
change before going to gym class do you
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
understand how absurd that is folks in
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
support of this bill may tell you that
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
they are worried about women's safety
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
with trans people in the women's B
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
bathroom I'm going to let you in on a
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
little secret though trans people have
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
always been in your bathrooms you just
 
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
saw them as the women they are and not
 
01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
as some sort of political scare tactic I
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
am a cisgender woman meaning the doctors
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
told my parents I was a girl when I was
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
born and I've drown grown up into the
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
young adult woman I am today and guess
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
what I haven't spent a single second
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
worrying about if a transwoman or a nonb
 
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
non-binary person came into my school's
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
girls bathroom in fact when I go to the
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
bathroom everyone usually just Minds
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
their own business and then leaves the
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
bathroom in a calm discreet manner no
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
one pays attention I apologize that's
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%

submitted her pin card a little later
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
than most people so we're putting her
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
towards the end of it but thank you for

good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee thank you for the
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Elanor
 
01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
MCD I live in exiter and I am opposed to
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
hb1 148 New Hampshire is a state that
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
values personal freedom for its citizens
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
and this legislation is a significant
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
blow to the freedoms that we hold dear
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
by attacking people simply because they
 
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
are different this discriminatory bill
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
is government overreach at its worst and
 
01:18:47.709 --> 01:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
is another example of conservative
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
cancel culture trying to erase
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
transgender and gender non-conforming
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
people in attempt to force us out of
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
public life this Bill sets the
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
horrifying precedent of creating a
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
government so big it demands you drop
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
your pants for genital inspections a
 
01:19:03.149 --> 01:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
government that is so invasive it
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
demands blood draws and chromosomal
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
tests for all people to dictate who can
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
play sports and use restrooms all to
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
solve a problem that does not exist this
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislation comes from a place of hatred
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
and animus towards a group of
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
law-abiding taxpaying citizens who have
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
done nothing wrong other than be
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstood by a bill sponsor who has
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
put forth only hypothetical scenarios
 
01:19:25.629 --> 01:19:25.639 align:start position:0%
where people who pretend to be trans
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
might commit crimes so why not focus on
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
those hypothetical criminals instead of
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
painting us all with the same brush if
 
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
people had complaints against from
 
01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
constituents about any other community
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
protected by civil rights laws would the
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor be targeting those people as
 
01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
well the legislation is also poorly
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
conceived as it as it does not define
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
the term biological sex the sponsor
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
saying everyone can tell and the bill
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
ends up erasing intersex people from
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
legal existence in addition to making
 
01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
life significantly more difficult for
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
transgender people the sponsor is

front of you um it starts with today's
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
date and in opposition to HB 148 I just
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
want to highlight um that sexual
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
violence and assault in prisons has been
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
an ongoing issue for the over 20 years
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
now um this bill does nothing but
 
01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
exacerbate that
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
issue I also want to highlight that if
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
we truly want to protect women and girls
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
in public then we need to be addressing
 
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
the culture of abuse in our society not
 
01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.189 align:start position:0%
the culture of abuse in our society not
sex

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
sex
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination um in closing I would
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
like to urge the committee to think
 
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
critically about how this bill would be
 
01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:49.719 align:start position:0%
enforced to me it reads as though it
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be a gross invasion of personal
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
privacy um so thank you again for this
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
opport Unity to testify against HB 148

Boston um I've just heard Tes me of
 
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
somebody saying this isn't a problem it
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
is a problem we have in my district a
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
little girl who's using the boys room um
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
those boys have no priv privacy when
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're using the urinal not sure why
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
she feels like she needs to be in there
 
01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
um there is uh according to Title 9 UM
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
it allows separation of restroom and
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
locker room facilities based on sex
 
01:22:46.199 --> 01:22:48.350 align:start position:0%
locker room facilities based on sex
section

01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
10633 um a recipient May provide
 
01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
separate toilet locker room and shower
 
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
facilities on the basis of sex but such
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
facilities provided for students of one
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
sex shall be comparable to such
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
facilities provided for students of the
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
other sex why does that not apply to
 
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.310 align:start position:0%
other sex why does that not apply to
school

01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
bathrooms I would also say that um we
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
can differentiate based on biological
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
sex uh the appeals courts in different
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
parts of the country have found that
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
biological sex separation is allowed
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
including the 11th Circuit Court of
 
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
Appeals in Adams and the 10th Circuit
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
Court of Appeals in Etsy
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
sex separated facility facilities are
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
justified by school's interest in
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
protecting its students bodily privacy
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
per New Hampshire school board policy
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
ACA Title Nine of the education
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
amendments Act of 1972 as well as RSA
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
19338 among others the school does not
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on this on the basis
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
of sex in its education programs and
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
activities including employment and
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
admissions in fact the uh board policy
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
ACAC was just updated and we uh most
 
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
School boards are doing emergency
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
adaptations of this new
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
policy um like most forms of sexual
 
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
harassment there's an unhealthy power
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
differential between schools and the
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
students who are pressured to share
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
private facilities in this way many
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
students are exceedingly uncomfortable
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
but at this young age students would
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
rather endure the sexual harassment than
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
risk the harassment and stigma that
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
comes with going against the authority
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
of their school on this issue the little
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
boys at the school district that I am do
 
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
not use the bathroom that's your time
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Ty
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
Frank thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
speak to the committee today I'd like to
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
just do a little bit of a a real time
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
invitation about perception and ask you
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
to just register who you perceive me to
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
be in this moment um and if that changes
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
if I take off my mask because I think
 
01:25:02.189 --> 01:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
this legislation actually really is
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
about perception uh and the perception
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
of individuals identity uh as they move
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
world so I am Ty Thompson I am a
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
transmasculine non-binary person my
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
pronouns are they them I live in
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
Nottingham New Hampshire I'm opposed to
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation this is legislation
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
that introduces the opportunity to
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on perception and
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
what we've heard in earlier uh
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill is that it is
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
up to your discretion as the state or a
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
business owner or whomever to choose
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not you choose to enforce um
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination in this way and deny
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
access to restrooms by by saying that
 
01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
you must enter the space that aligns
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
with your assigned sex at Birth so I
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
have always been a more masculine
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
presenting person even prior to Medical
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
transition as part of my journey in this
 
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
world uh throughout my life as my
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
younger self entering women's restroom
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
spaces I have been yelled at threatened
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
gotten the weird looks and the strange
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
comments and the
 
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
surprise I was
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
present last week at the Senate hearing
 
01:26:18.109 --> 01:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
for this same bill and the senator who
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill when asked how would
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
we how would we regulate this and how
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
would we force it his response was to
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
say I don't know that's not my job but
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
if it was my daughter I would enforce it
 
01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
this is not a Veiled Threat this is a
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
direct threat and what it is doing is
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
really fear-mongering and continue to
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
like justify this type of fearful
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
response to vulnerable vulnerable
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
members of our communities uh and it's
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
not just and it's going to create more
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
problems I apologize but that's your
 
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.109 --> 01:26:58.119 align:start position:0%
question representative McFarland could
 
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%

01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
testimony so I I appreciate your
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
testimony uh as regards somebody having
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
a a casual encounter with you and trying
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
to form an understanding of of what you
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
may be and what you may not be if you
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
understand the bill to in large part be
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
focused on fac facilities in schools and
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
in uh prisons and other detention
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
facilities nature of the relationship
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
with the individuals is a longlasting
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
one could you explain uh why it
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
circumstance I think bills like this are
 
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
really the tip of the iceberg for
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
continued legislation ongoing that
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
perpetuates uh rights and freedoms of
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
individuals who are transgender
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
individuals I think that this
 
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
legislation has broader implication
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
besides just what happens in schools and
 
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
what happens in prisons it's really
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
about being able to discriminate and say
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
that people can only use restrooms
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
changing spaces locker rooms Etc across
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
all areas of our New Hampshire
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
life any other questions seeing none
 
01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.750 align:start position:0%
life any other questions seeing none

01:28:44.109 --> 01:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
have transitioned in New Hampshire at
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire clinics uh and I'm
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
testifying against HB 148 today in my
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
experience transgender people in general
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
and transgender youth in particular are
 
01:28:56.189 --> 01:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
not a threat to public spaces like
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
bathrooms or locker rooms are not a
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
threat to other prisoners while
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and are not a threat to
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
fairness in sports in fact transgender
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
transgender people especially
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
transgender women and girls are at far
 
01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
higher risk of violence and sexual
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
violence in these spaces than there
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
isgender counterparts New Hampshire has
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
good law on the books protecting trans
 
01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:19.639 align:start position:0%
people and there is no reason to peel
 
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
back these protections and that includes
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
the school sports issue the overblown
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
concerns being presented today present
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
this issue as entirely black and white
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
but there have absolutely been effective
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
regulations used by athletic
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
associations from youth to professional
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
leagues that effectively regulate trans
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
participation in sports often in
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration with athletes Healthcare
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
Providers and it is entirely possible to
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
ensure fairness and safety without
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
excluding trans people from Sports
 
01:29:49.149 --> 01:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
entirely I find the impulse to
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
immediately ban to be very troubling gr
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
transgender granite Staters deserve the
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
same options for recreation and healthy
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
activity as everyone else these skills
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
are built during childhood and if you
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
take away these opportunities these will
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
create poor health outcomes in the
 
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
future I urge you to oppose HB 148 and
 
01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
all anti-trans legislation because there
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
are real issues facing the people of New
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that they want action on and
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
this is a waste of time thank you any
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to call On Em
 
01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:49.870 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to call On Em
Brock

01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
Brock good morning thank you for letting
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
me speak
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
I here today as a mother asking you to
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
vote no on HP 148 I'm a proud mother of
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
two kind smart artistic young adults one
 
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
who is
 
01:31:07.149 --> 01:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
transgender I wish I didn't have to be
 
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:09.400 align:start position:0%
here today but my family is under
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
attack many politicians have decided
 
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
that my child is a predator that does
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
not deserve equal rights this is wrong
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
and goes against everything that New
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is supposed to stand for in
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
the self-proclaimed Live Free or Die
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
State according to the am American
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric association the term
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
transgender refers to a person whose sex
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
assigned at Birth I.E the sex assigned
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
at Birth usually based on external
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
genitalia does not align their J
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
identity with their gener identity I.E
 
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
one psychological sense of their gender
 
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
being transgender does not make you a
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
Peeping Tom being transgender does not
 
01:31:49.109 --> 01:31:49.119 align:start position:0%
make you a pedophile being transgender
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
does not make you a predator the concern
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
I hear referenced without evidence is
 
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
that men will pretend that they are
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
transgender to gain access to bathrooms
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
and locker rooms to pray on women if
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
anyone a woman a man or a transgender
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
woman or a transgender man is behaving
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
in a predatory way we have other
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
harassment privacy and sexual assault
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
laws that can remove anyone acting
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriately there's no logic to the
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
thought that transgender people's rights
 
01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
should be taken away just in case s
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
gender men try to access women's
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
bathrooms discrimination is not to be
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
taken lightly and should not be allowed
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
just in case my daughter is a New
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen who deserves to live
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
freely just as her brother does my
 
01:32:41.229 --> 01:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
family is not a woke agenda we are real
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
people that suffer the real consequences
 
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
of the hateful rhetoric being pushed by
 
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.390 align:start position:0%
of the hateful rhetoric being pushed by
some

01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
politicians at this point I just wish
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
the politians politicians would leave us
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
alone I apologize but that's your
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
time I asked you that I submitted a
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
paper um including a speech that my
 
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
daughter wrote last year regarding
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
suicide among transgender youth I urge
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
you to please read it thank you any
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
questions at all seeing none thank you

01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable members of the
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and members of the
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
public my name is Miss Arora Weatherby I
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
live in Derry New Hampshire half for my
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
entire life um some of you may May
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
recognize me from my testimony a few
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
weeks ago against uh the now withdrawn
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
476 frankly I'm disappointed in the
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
state's legislature that I felt it
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to testify against two P Bill
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
proposals in such a short period of time
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
given the uh rather short um two-minute
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
limit I'm going to get right to the
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
point um how will this provision be
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
enforced will we be checking genitals
 
01:34:50.109 --> 01:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
the thought of having everyone's
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
genitals checked at the bathroom door
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
seems unappealing to say the least if we
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
didn't check genitals then how would we
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
Define biological sex would we re would
 
01:35:01.709 --> 01:35:01.719 align:start position:0%
we require every New Hampshire citizen
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
to get a chromosome test who would pay
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
for those how would the state deal with
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
chromosomal differences such as Klein
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
felters and Turners would we require
 
01:35:11.950 --> 01:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
people to amend their birth certificates
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
and documents if testing revealed a
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
surprise that was previously
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
unknown I would also like to focus on uh
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
the provision that allows um trans
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
people to be housed in the um
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities of their assign
 
01:35:31.229 --> 01:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
sex at Birth Studies have shown that
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
trans women uh when housed in men's
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
prisons have incredibly High rates of
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
prison rape whether intended or not this
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
bill if passed will result in transwoman
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
convicts being brutally raped by male
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
inmates as a transwoman myself it feels
 
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
as if the sponsors and supporters of
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
this bill have looked me directly in the
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
eyes and said I do not care if you get
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
raped members of the committee if you
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill all subsequent prison
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
rapes just interrupt you for a second
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
let's not apply motives to other
 
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives please uh that wasn't
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
that was not the intent I'm just
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
expressing my own feelings about the
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
bill um as a final point I take issue
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
with the wording of biological sex as
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier and I would like to
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
close uh by saying that I am sad to see
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire being so affected by
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
national political Trends our state has
 
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
always prided itself in preserving
 
01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
individual Freedom not freedom for big
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
groups I plead with the committee
 
01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
preserve what makes New Hampshire time
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die death is not the worst
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
of evils give this state liberty or give
 
01:36:37.639 --> 01:36:39.950 align:start position:0%
of evils give this state liberty or give
it

01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
death Cedar
 
01:36:50.669 --> 01:36:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
Richards Dear honorable members of the
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Comm my name is Cedar Pleasant
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a Manchester
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
resident it's been pretty well
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
documented with the previous speakers
 
01:37:03.149 --> 01:37:03.159 align:start position:0%
that this bill does nothing to create
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
safety it's also been said that how are
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
we going to enforce it and I want to
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
address that in a different
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
way the bill is directly directed at
 
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
trans population the sponsors and
 
01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
proponents of the bill are not afraid of
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
women entering a men's room they are
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
clearly afraid of men entering a woman's
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
room it was specific specifically
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the sponsor today Let's
 
01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
ignore the cruelty for a moment of not
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that trans women are
 
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
women let's focus through the lens of
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
the sponsors speaking this
 
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
morning that the in a way that can be
 
01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
understood that way the only thing
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
stopping men from walking into a woman's
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
door so this isn't about fear of trans
 
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
of which most of the sponsors of this
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
bill are or are
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
they how do we actually know that
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
multiple sponsors of this bill are
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
men how will it be enforced and make no
 
01:38:13.709 --> 01:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
mistake cisgendered people will be
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
subjected to the same treatments in
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
verifying gender as transgender people
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
are specifically addressing the worry
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
about sports with transgender people
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
there are already Men playing women's
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
sports there are already women playing
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
men's sports what keeps you from knowing
 
01:38:37.229 --> 01:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
it is you're making it so unsafe for
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
people to say it so they have always
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
men if you actually are interested in
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
safety the bill is useless in helping it
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
the Amer as as previously mentioned the
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%

Hawkins good morning uh thank you so
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
much for hearing my testimony my name is
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Richards I'm a resident of
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
Pembrook New Hampshire and I'm here
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to House Bill 148 I
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
am not transgender like so many of the
 
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
people you've heard from today my
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
children are not trans my spouse isn't
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
trans there's no one in my family who's
 
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
trans uh and for a moment when I Was
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
preparing to come today I thought that
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
maybe that made my testimony less valid
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
I don't have a personal story to share
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
but I don't need a personal connection
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
to know that this is wrong when you hear
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
a community who is at greater risk for
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
violence telling you this puts us at
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
risk we have an obligation to listen and
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
to act
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
trans people have always been here they
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
will always be here they are a part of
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
our community they are our neighbors and
 
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
our friends and our loved ones and we
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to listen to their
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
stories and to act in their best
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
interests I want to live in a state and
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
in a community where all people can
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
Thrive and feel safe and welcome this
 
01:40:20.189 --> 01:40:20.199 align:start position:0%
bill does not do that we have
 
01:40:22.589 --> 01:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
established law that says that all
 
01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
people are safe and welcome here I don't
 
01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
understand it is absolutely confounding
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
to me why we are even revisiting this
 
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
please please vote in opposition to this
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%

01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
bearing on my life and I still took a
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
day off work to to be here people feel
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
very passionately about this and have

turned out to tell you how they feel uh
 
01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:50.679 align:start position:0%
it's been overwhelming today to listen
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%

name is Sam Hawkins I'm representing
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
Nami New Hampshire in opposition to
 
01:41:21.149 --> 01:41:21.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 148 as an organization
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
committed to promoting the mental

01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
harmful impacts of stigma and
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination on Mental Health as such
 
01:41:32.189 --> 01:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
we are firm in our opposition to any
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
policies that further stigma and enable
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination and this bill does just
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
that in the compelling State interest
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
established in the Bill's text it
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
furthers damaging stigma and in its
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
policies it will expose Granite Staters
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
to discrimination in their communities
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
in workplace in involuntary treatment in
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
places where people choose to be but
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
also in places places where people have
 
01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
no choice in being this will have a
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
chilling effect not only on our trans
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
and non-binary community members but
 
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
also their families their loved ones and
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
the communities they've found inform
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
formed in this state for that reason

01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
similar policies that come before the
 
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
committee any
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
you Reverend John
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
Oliver good morning thank you for uh
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
being here and for having me testify I'm
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
Pastor Jonathan Hopkins I'm the pastor
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
of Concordia Lutheran Church here in
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
conquered New Hampshire and I oppose
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
this bill as a father as of a trans
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
child who has to walk through this world
 
01:42:45.679 --> 01:42:46.709 align:start position:0%
child who has to walk through this world
every

01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
day uh in fear of being bullied and
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
discriminated against I speak against it
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
as a CI of and someone who grew up in
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and loves this state I
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I've told my child who now
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
goes to college in Massachusetts that
 
01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
they probably can never live in New
 
01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again it will be unsafe for
 
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
them to do
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
so um and I oppose it as a pastor and
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's really other people have spoken
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
more eloquently about uh being a parent
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
and being a citizen but as a
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
pastor I want you to know that in the
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
Old Testament there are actually eight
 
01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.430 align:start position:0%
Old Testament there are actually eight
genders

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
genders
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
in the original Hebrew that our given
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
voice in in that text there's nothing in
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
Jesus words that would have us
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
discriminate against trans folks the and
 
01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
so and even if there was let's just
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
let's just assume that the biblical
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
witness was clear that we should
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
discriminate somehow against trans folks
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
even if that was that would be usurped
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
by the Commandment that we all follow
 
01:43:50.589 --> 01:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
which is to love your neighbor as
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
yourself and you've heard much testimony
 
01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:53.669 align:start position:0%
yourself and you've heard much testimony
today

01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
eloquently from people of your state
 
01:43:58.350 --> 01:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
begging you and I am begging you to love
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
their children to care for their
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
children enough not to discriminate
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
against them I'm asking you to not
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate against people in my
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
congregation who try to live a life of
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
love and care and be good citizens and
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
you are making it more hard by this by
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
passing laws like this you have
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
demonized as other people have said
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
demonize people for cheap political
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
points to win elections and instead of
 
01:44:25.149 --> 01:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
loving and caring for all the citizens
 
01:44:27.629 --> 01:44:27.639 align:start position:0%
that you serve refra from applying
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
motive to the bill please well take it
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth that's your time
 
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you asking your pastor to
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
difficult you have a question
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan um I was well I
 
01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:45.639 align:start position:0%
was just saying if would you find if you
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
found that what your family went through
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
was probably very difficult but not as
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
difficult as it would have been if your
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh child had not transitioned to be who
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
they really are is that a fair statement
 
01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:01.639 align:start position:0%
that no I wouldn't say that I would say
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
that our family has been greatly blessed
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
because my child struggled their whole
 
01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:09.149 align:start position:0%
because my child struggled their whole
life

01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
to thank you find out who they are and
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%

on like eight different meds once they
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
transitioned they are only on one men
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%

question for you it for you it's my
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that one of the things
 
01:45:41.229 --> 01:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
that's very important in the New
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature is that we have
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
hearings on every bill and we do not
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
assume that um the members of the
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
committee are in support or in
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
opposition we are here today to hear
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
from the public and to help
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
inform um our views to give us more
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
information so am I am I incorrect In in
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
assuming no in stating not just assuming
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
that no one should assume that they know
 
01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
how any member of this committee will
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
eventually vote Yes you are absolutely
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%

next good morning chair and members of
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for allowing me
 
01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
to speak my name is Will Oliver I am a
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
concerned New Hampshire resident and a
 
01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
non-binary person I proudly live and
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
work in the white mountain region
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
serving visitors to this great state I'm
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
testifying today because I would be
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
horrified to ask one of my trans friends
 
01:46:57.149 --> 01:46:57.159 align:start position:0%
to use the wrong bathroom or
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
facility I think it is appalling that
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives who sit in our
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
government so lack a basic understanding
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
of trans people that they would even
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
suggest such a law if there is one thing
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we can all learn from the queer
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
movement it's that we need to believe
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
people when they tell us who they are if
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
you need science to back that up I say
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
to this bill sponsors knock yourself out
 
01:47:18.669 --> 01:47:18.679 align:start position:0%
check out the recommendations from the
 
01:47:22.589 --> 01:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
APA the AMA you name it I and so many
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
other Americans are sick of hearing
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
trans people scapegoated when they are
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
doing nothing wrong if their concerns
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
about safety or about privacy great
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
there are already other laws in place
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
for that but those concerns give
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
lawmakers no right to discriminate
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
against people on the basis of gender
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
identity a protection that is literally
 
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
specified by the law that this bill aims
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
to amend policing people's gender as
 
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
they enter the bathroom leads to a
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
slippery slope of body inspections and
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
potentially worse for everyone and those
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
are proposals we've heard suggested
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in our country country if we
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
are so concerned about the safety of our
 
01:47:57.629 --> 01:47:57.639 align:start position:0%
residents if we are so concerned about
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
women and children then why don't we
 
01:48:00.189 --> 01:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
look at the group who is most
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for violence against them
 
01:48:04.990 --> 01:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
both sexual and physical that's right
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
cisgender men an overwhelming majority
 
01:48:12.189 --> 01:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
in some cases up to 94% of perpetrators
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
if we are so concerned about the safety
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
of women and children then why don't we
 
01:48:16.589 --> 01:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
follow the statistics instead of
 
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
obsessing over imaginary crimes
 
01:48:19.870 --> 01:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
committed by trans
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
people the most dangerous person to
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
women and children in the state of New
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a man that they know and I
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
think that this fact is exactly what
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
bills like this hope to distract
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
from trans people are beautiful powerful
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful brave people they deserve so
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
much more than this our friends
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
neighbors co-workers and family members
 
01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:42.679 align:start position:0%
that's your time they deserve so much
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
more than this I also wanted to submit
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
one piece of evidence um a proponent of
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
this bill earlier mentioned a study uh
 
01:48:50.669 --> 01:48:50.679 align:start position:0%
claiming that trans women retain a quote

01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
to oppose Bill
 
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
148 as a cisgender woman born a woman
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
identified as a woman this bill does not
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
keep me any safer when I use public
 
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
restrooms and trust me I have a lot of
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
experience with public restrooms being
 
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
an outdoor worker I have to use them all
 
01:52:35.229 --> 01:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
day long no man has ever tried to get in
 
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
there to hurt me however some male
 
01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislators think that they can surveil
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
me in the restroom and that's okay it's
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
not okay and what else is not okay is
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
surveillance of my trans family members
 
01:52:49.679 --> 01:52:50.709 align:start position:0%
surveillance of my trans family members
and

01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
friends I have a transwoman family
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
member who is also afraid like was
 
01:52:58.589 --> 01:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned that if she's
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
forced to use the women's restroom
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
against this law because she doesn't
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
want to be assaulted in the men's
 
01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
restroom that she'll have to go to Men's
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
prison or men but it's terrifying to
 
01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
people and it needs to stop it doesn't
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
help anybody this bill but it hurts
 
01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
everybody through the extra surveillance
 
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
possibly extra use of taxpayer money to
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
like enforce it nobody is helped by this
 
01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
and everybody is harmed so let's oppose
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
it table it whatever we have to do to
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%

C good morning my name is Billy strong I
 
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
was born in New Hampshire I have lived
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
here the majority of my life and I
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
currently work full-time as a mechanical
 
01:54:13.709 --> 01:54:13.719 align:start position:0%
and Robotics engineer in Manchester I
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
also happen to be a transgender woman
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill creates a carve out from our
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
state's discrimination protections
 
01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
designed specifically to facilitate the
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
oppression of of gender nonconforming
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
individuals like myself the text
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
describes circumstances in which
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
classification based on biological sex a
 
01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
term as others have noted which is not
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
defined in the text of the bill or the
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
amended statute would be broadly
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
permitted the justif justification
 
01:54:39.629 --> 01:54:39.639 align:start position:0%
provided for this classification is
 
01:54:41.790 --> 01:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
protecting rights and physical safety
 
01:54:44.069 --> 01:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
privacy rights and physical safety but
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
this text would permit individuals and
 
01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
organizations to discriminate based on
 
01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
personal physiological characteristics
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
which cannot always be ascertained in
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
civil interaction
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
in practice this language will encourage
 
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
public confrontations of gender
 
01:54:58.109 --> 01:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
non-conforming people by private
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
individuals solely based on our
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
appearance and social presentation a
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
practice which would surely threaten our
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
privacy and safety this would affect
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
both children and adults and would have
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
impacts extending far beyond the trans
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
Community not all visibly gender
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
non-conforming persons are
 
01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
transgender a goodfaith effort to
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
protect the privacy and safety of all
 
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
citizens would account for the risks
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
faced by all citizens including those
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
who do not conform to stereotypical
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
gender roles and
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
presentations this bill is written from
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
a perspective which views gender
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
non-conforming people like me as
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
intrinsically threatening or harmful by
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
omitting explicit mitigations for The
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
Unique privacy and safety risks
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
experienced by transgender people this
 
01:55:41.069 --> 01:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
Bill de prioritizes our safety relative
 
01:55:43.229 --> 01:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the population on this
 
01:55:45.069 --> 01:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
basis I oppose the adoption of this text
 
01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:46.719 align:start position:0%
into law and I encourage the members of
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
this committee to do the same thank you
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I came here today because I am
 
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
a woman and I am afraid I have been
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
afraid since the non-discrimination bill
 
01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
2018 um I became aware of these isues
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
many years ago when I was a teenager and
 
01:56:25.870 --> 01:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
they were published in the
 
01:56:30.069 --> 01:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
newspaper and it became clear back
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
around 2003 that wow if if these men
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
biological men who say they're trans um
 
01:56:40.510 --> 01:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
assert their rights over women women's
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
rights are dead letter how can we go
 
01:56:47.229 --> 01:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
into a bathroom and and not be afraid of
 
01:56:49.709 --> 01:56:49.719 align:start position:0%
seeing a man about not being able to
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
speak up if something is going wrong
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
that is the key to women's bathrooms the
 
01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
idea that women collectively are aware
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
of what goes on and that we speak up as
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
soon as something is going wrong that
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
we're not waiting for somebody to get
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
raped that we're not waiting for some
 
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
man to commit a sex act that we're not
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if some man is in this
 
01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
bathroom for a sexual
 
01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.350 align:start position:0%
bathroom for a sexual
thrill

01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
thrill
 
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
ick how can we tell our daughters that
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's okay in this state to go and change
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
their mentor products I would have loved
 
01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:26.679 align:start position:0%

01:58:35.629 --> 01:58:35.639 align:start position:0%
I'm reading testimony from a person who
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
could not be here today Colleen gadwa
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
this bill which seeks to classify
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
individuals based on biological sex and
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
laboratory facilities locker rooms
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
sporting competitions and detention
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
facilities is a harmful and
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
discriminatory proposal that undermines
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
the dignity safety and rights of
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
transgender and gender non-conforming
 
01:58:57.149 --> 01:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
individuals it perpetuates exclusion
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
Fosters inequality and ignores the lived
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
experiences of those who do not conform
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
to rigid binary gender Norms by
 
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
mandating such classifications this bill
 
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
not only violates the principles of
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
fairness and inclusivity but also puts
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
vulnerable individuals at risk of
 
01:59:14.109 --> 01:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
harassment discrimination and violence
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
transgender people deserve the same
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
rights and protections as everyone else
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
including the right to access public
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
spaces participate in sports and be
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
treated with respect and detention
 
01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
facilities this bill sends a damaging
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
message that their identities are
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
invalid and Unworthy of recognition this
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is unnecessary and divisive
 
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
there is no evidence to suggest that
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
inclusive policies pose a threat to
 
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
Public Safety or fairness in sports in
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
fact inclusive environments benefit
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
Everyone by fostering understanding
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
respect and equality this bill instead
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
seeks to solve a problem that does not
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
exist while creating real harm for
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
transgender individuals and their
 
01:59:52.109 --> 01:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
families we must stand against this bill
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
in any legislation that seeks to
 
01:59:56.109 --> 01:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
marginalize dehumanize People based on
 
01:59:58.589 --> 01:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
their gender identity our society should
 
02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
strive to protect and uplift all its
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
members not enact policies that exclude
 
02:00:05.229 --> 02:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
and discriminate I urge lawmakers to
 
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
reject this bill and instead focus on
 
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
creating policies that promote equality
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
dignity and justice for everyone thank
 
02:00:16.830 --> 02:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you Avery
 
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members good morning
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
my name is Avery I am a transgender
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
woman I am a resident of New Hampshire I
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
have lived my whole life in the state of
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or I'm resident of
 
02:00:38.669 --> 02:00:38.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester excuse me I'm here today to
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
voice my Fierce opposition to HB 148 I
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
can tell you the legal issues with this
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
bill that biological sex is a vague and
 
02:00:47.950 --> 02:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
undefined term both legally and
 
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
scientifically neither the text of this
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
bill nor RSA 34 5A defines this term
 
02:00:56.109 --> 02:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
leaving it vulnerable to misuse more
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
importantly adding exceptions to
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
existing anti-discrimination ordinances
 
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
is dangerous and unethical if we
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
legalize discrimination based on sex and
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
gender how does this not open legal
 
02:01:08.669 --> 02:01:08.679 align:start position:0%
Pathways to other discrimination based
 
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
on other factors in existing
 
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination ordinances it is
 
02:01:14.669 --> 02:01:14.679 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to carve out holes and
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
legal protections for any granite stator
 
02:01:19.149 --> 02:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
I can also give you my personal issues
 
02:01:21.069 --> 02:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
with this bill that it emboldens and
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%
encourages big against many people
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to women the
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
lgbtq community and the trans people in
 
02:01:31.149 --> 02:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
particular this vague statute will
 
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
embolden those who wish to discriminate
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
and confront people they view as others
 
02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
something we experience quite enough of
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
already whether it's passers by who
 
02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:41.719 align:start position:0%
shouted slays at me or shouted slays at
 
02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
my community as we mourned our dead on
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
the steps of the capital whether it's my
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
coworker who when I confided my trans
 
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
identity to him repeatedly made
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
disgusting comments and told me that he
 
02:01:52.950 --> 02:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
would rape me
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
this bill enables this harassment and
 
02:01:56.430 --> 02:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
violence and prevents legal recourse for
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
those affected it makes it acceptable to
 
02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
Target anyone deemed not man or woman
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
enough against an arbitrary standard of
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
acceptability HB 148 is discriminatory
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
in its intent and flawed in its text I
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill and I urge you
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
to do the same thank you any questions
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and paper copies
 
02:02:21.229 --> 02:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
for y Christine Hughes followed by
 
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay my name is Christine Hughes and I'm
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
here to oppose HB
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
148 I've raised a transgender daughter
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
I've been here to testify a few times
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
over the last many
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
years my daughter knew who she was when
 
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
she was 5 years old and her dad who
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier and I educated ourselves
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
and supported our child our community in
 
02:02:54.189 --> 02:02:54.199 align:start position:0%
Durham New Hampshire made way for her to
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
develop into the strong young woman that
 
02:02:59.470 --> 02:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
she is today but it wasn't always easy
 
02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
for her we had one experience at a local
 
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
me movie theater when she went into the
 
02:03:06.109 --> 02:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
bathroom that matched her gender marker
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
on her birth certificate a large man
 
02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
approached me to say ma'am your daughter
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
was using the wrong bathroom this was
 
02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
when she was probably 8 years old
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
imagine what people would say if she
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
started using the men's bathroom at 19 I
 
02:03:22.189 --> 02:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
want to say I think she looks a little
 
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
bit like dual Lipa the famous talented
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
musician another time when she was using
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
the bathroom that matched her gender
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
marker on her birth certificate at
 
02:03:32.830 --> 02:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
school she was stopped by her peers in
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
the bathroom and they made her pull her
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
pants down to prove that she had a
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
penis whose privacy was being protected
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
instance she was able to play on several
 
02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
teams throughout her time in the Oyster
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
River School District and she also
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
attended a private high school where she
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
was welcom to compete on the girls'
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
teams she heard Slanders from marks
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
being shouted from the sidelines by
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
students whose privacy was at stake in
 
02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:57.750 align:start position:0%
students whose privacy was at stake in
this

02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
situation who exactly are they trying to
 
02:04:05.629 --> 02:04:05.639 align:start position:0%
protect and why really there will always
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
be exceptions to any rule but there are
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
many transgender law-abiding active
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
service members in our community that do
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
not need to be discriminated against
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
because they there are people who are
 
02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
anxious about things they are unwilling
 
02:04:22.990 --> 02:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
to try and understand
 
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
I can guarantee that the transgender
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
people in our state live most days in a
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
constant state of fear because of all
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
the idiots think they know better I
 
02:04:34.589 --> 02:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
apologize but that's your time okay
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
please vote no on HB 148 we are very
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
tired of this thank you thank you
 
02:04:42.159 --> 02:04:44.069 align:start position:0%
tired of this thank you thank you

02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
good morning uh my name is Julian Lee
 
02:05:03.310 --> 02:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
and I live in Hampton
 
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
Falls I'm a longtime resident of New
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and proud to be a citizen of
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
this Live Free or Die State and I'm also
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
transgender I have been all my life and
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
I'm proud of that as well I lead a
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
transgender adult support group and as a
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
result I've met and and know hundreds of
 
02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:30.549 align:start position:0%
result I've met and and know hundreds of
transgender

02:05:30.549 --> 02:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
women when I was a kid I didn't know the
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
word for being trans but now I do and
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
fortunately now we have reams of
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
corresponding data about trans people in
 
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
today every reputable Medical
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
existence the last time I uh I was here
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
and testified uh it was eight years ago
 
02:06:05.549 --> 02:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
on behalf of HB
 
02:06:05.559 --> 02:06:07.229 align:start position:0%
on behalf of HB
1319

02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
1319
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
thankfully that Landmark uh legislation
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
was passed adding gender identity to
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
state law and it changed my life in that
 
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
of thousands of New Hampshire
 
02:06:28.229 --> 02:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
residents in the most positive ways
 
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
imaginable sadly now eight years later
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
we're back here again debating trans
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
rights and whether people like me can
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
still be
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
trusted to use a public bathroom that
 
02:06:44.549 --> 02:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
corresponds to who we really
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
are fortunately we now have eight years
 
02:06:47.199 --> 02:06:48.109 align:start position:0%
are fortunately we now have eight years
of

02:06:48.109 --> 02:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
data to prove that we can be a that we
 
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
can be trusted that we're
 
02:06:58.830 --> 02:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
anyone I apologize but that's your
 
02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.549 align:start position:0%
anyone I apologize but that's your
time

02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:07:08.109 --> 02:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
okay so I would urge the committee
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
to strongly reject this discriminatory
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you thank
 
02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
you Sarah
 
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Sarah Smith uh
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
live in pimbrook New Hampshire and I'm
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
here opposed to HP 148 um for for many
 
02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that have already been
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
said today I which I think are show that
 
02:07:49.549 --> 02:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
it is inherently
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and uh
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
I believe that no human being or a class
 
02:07:59.229 --> 02:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
of people are illegal or inherently
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
criminal um so I have a few points I
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
agreed with a lot of what was said
 
02:08:07.149 --> 02:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
before but um I I I would like to point
 
02:08:10.189 --> 02:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
out that contrary to what this law
 
02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
purports women's bathrooms and locker
 
02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:14.679 align:start position:0%
rooms have privacy features that make
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
the intended use private as common
 
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
practice for single stall bathrooms to
 
02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
be non-gendered so we know the usage
 
02:08:25.149 --> 02:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
itself is not a concern to the public
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
all of the women's locker rooms I have
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
been in have private changing stalls um
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
so this this is a to me is is a nonissue
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
um I agree again that the illegal use of
 
02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
the facilities for harassment
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
intimidation or assault is clearly
 
02:08:43.669 --> 02:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
against the law and all are pro are
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
innocent until proven
 
02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
guilty but oh the one point I thing that
 
02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't been spoken about here is the
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
effect that this law has on other people
 
02:08:58.270 --> 02:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
um so these restrictions don't always
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
only affect the trans people but their
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
loved ones friends colleagues work
 
02:09:06.430 --> 02:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
participation if my trans wife is not
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to use the toilet in a place for
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
instance a restaurant I won't go there
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
either nor will other friends spor teens
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
or recreational skiers or people
 
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
attending conferences or religious
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
gatherings won't even come to the state
 
02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
if people want a North Country
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
experience they'll visit Maine or
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
Vermont instead so now what we're
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
talking about this affecting everyone
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
and and not just affecting people in
 
02:09:38.549 --> 02:09:38.559 align:start position:0%
that's your time thank you very much for
 
02:09:38.559 --> 02:09:42.430 align:start position:0%
that's your time thank you very much for
your

02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh hi my name is Naomi lmore I'm a
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
resident of Dover New Hampshire and I'm
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
here to speak in opposition to House
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 148 classifying one based on
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
biological sex for the purpose of
 
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
entering them into facilities non-
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
congruent with their identity will only
 
02:10:13.149 --> 02:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
drastically increase the chance that
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
this already atrisk demographic will
 
02:10:18.189 --> 02:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
face sexual violence and discrimination
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
which RSA
 
02:10:22.589 --> 02:10:22.599 align:start position:0%
354a specifically for protects against
 
02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:24.559 align:start position:0%
consider the fact that hormone
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
replacement therapy directly Alters
 
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
one's appearance in the following ways
 
02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
for trans women development of breaths
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
hips and redistribution of body mass in
 
02:10:34.109 --> 02:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
a way which directly parallels the
 
02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
female biology imagine the danger
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
someone with these characteristic spaces
 
02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
in an environment such as a male
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
prisoner shelter passing this bill will
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
only lead to rape assault and
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
discrimination against anyone placed in
 
02:10:48.109 --> 02:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
these or similar situations which RSA
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
354 protects against uh furthering that
 
02:10:53.470 --> 02:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
point statistics recorded by the FBI
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
concluded that in 2023 over 2,800 hate
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
crimes were recorded against people in
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq plus Community almost one in4
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the overall total and over 500 of
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
these were confirmed to be gender
 
02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
identity motivated the myth that trans
 
02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
people are predators is a misinformation
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
campaign and I would like to challenge
 
02:11:13.709 --> 02:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
anyone supporting this bill to prove
 
02:11:15.870 --> 02:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
that otherwise in regards to Athletics
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
and sports the purpose of this bill is
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
touted as secur as securing safety and
 
02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
privacy which is outside of the scope of
 
02:11:24.549 --> 02:11:24.559 align:start position:0%
competing in sports it's a blatant
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
attempt to piggy back off of the
 
02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
executive order that was signed and it
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
simply as a means to push as much
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
litigation as quickly and lazily as
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
possible excuse me as possible due to
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
all of the above I find House Bill 148
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
to be mired in hipocracy it states to
 
02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
protect privacy and physical safety of
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
all but only serves the place of
 
02:11:44.910 --> 02:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
minority with valid legal rights
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
unfairly into dangerous environments
 
02:11:47.629 --> 02:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
that are not fitting with the
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws the very Bill
 
02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
seeks to attempt to amend in doing this
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
it directly contradicts itself and RSA
 
02:11:57.069 --> 02:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
354 when it states New Hampshire's
 
02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental commitment to treat all
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%

hello my name is Sarah King I'm from
 
02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
Derry New Hampshire I'm here to voice my
 
02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 148 as a history
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
student at brandise University I would
 
02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
like to highlight a couple of Parallels
 
02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
for you the first lgbtqia plus affirming
 
02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
sexual Research Institute in the world
 
02:12:42.030 --> 02:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
was in Germany this Clinic's purpose was
 
02:12:44.109 --> 02:12:44.119 align:start position:0%
to educate the public on sexuality and
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
gender identity in a way that affirmed
 
02:12:49.549 --> 02:12:49.559 align:start position:0%
lgbtqia plus people it had Library a
 
02:12:51.870 --> 02:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
museum and counseling that Illustrated
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
the diversity of human gender and
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
sexuality throughout history and culture
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
they were one of the only places that
 
02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
would hope openly hire trans people they
 
02:13:02.189 --> 02:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
provided gender affirming care and
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
surgeries now on May 6th
 
02:13:07.549 --> 02:13:07.559 align:start position:0%
1933 this institute was burned down by
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
the Nazi party they then proceeded to
 
02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
forcibly d-transition strip the rights
 
02:13:14.589 --> 02:13:14.599 align:start position:0%
of imprison and murder the trans
 
02:13:16.589 --> 02:13:16.599 align:start position:0%
citizens of Germany alongside thousands
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
of other queer
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
individuals history has shown us what
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
happens when a political groups start
 
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
scapegoating others to gain power what
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
happened in Germany between 1933 and
 
02:13:29.229 --> 02:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
1945 and that stat phenomena is
 
02:13:31.629 --> 02:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
happening right now in our country this
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to scare and divide us
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
to allow fearmongers to push a group of
 
02:13:38.189 --> 02:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
people out of public life to classify
 
02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
and force them into hiding for political
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
gain and I don't mean to only draw the
 
02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
parallel to how they treated transgender
 
02:13:46.350 --> 02:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
people let me be absolutely clear this
 
02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
sentiment this bill reflects exactly the
 
02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
Nazi Central ideology of a return to
 
02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
cultural values which resulted in the
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
deaths of millions of Jewish people
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
political dissenters Romani disabled
 
02:13:59.069 --> 02:13:59.079 align:start position:0%
people and all others who did not fit
 
02:14:01.709 --> 02:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
their standard in concentration camps
 
02:14:03.629 --> 02:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
there's a powerful poetic form which has
 
02:14:05.549 --> 02:14:05.559 align:start position:0%
been circulating the internet as of late
 
02:14:07.629 --> 02:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
coined by Martin Neer regarding his
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
guilt about passivity during the Nazi
 
02:14:12.030 --> 02:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
regime it reads first they came for a
 
02:14:13.870 --> 02:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
group and I did not speak out because I
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
was not of that group then they came for
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it continues until it reaches the
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
point of and then they came for me and
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
there was no one left to speak for me
 
02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:22.950 align:start position:0%
there was no one left to speak for me
thank

02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:22.960 align:start position:0%

02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
you that's your time thank
 
02:14:30.750 --> 02:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
Trumble good morning honorable
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
representatives of the house Judiciary
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
Committee and thank you for listening to
 
02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
these testimonies today my name is Scott
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
files I have been a resident of do since
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
my graduation from UNH in 2016
 
02:14:54.109 --> 02:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
I'm a loving uncle brother and son and a
 
02:14:55.629 --> 02:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
good employee of a large New Hampshire
 
02:14:58.750 --> 02:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
company I'm also a transgender man I
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
come before you today to voice my
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill 148 looking at
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
me today do you really think it is
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate for me to use a women's
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
restroom if this bill is passed I could
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
be forced to do so I can imagine
 
02:15:12.990 --> 02:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
scenarios of confused and uncomfortable
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
women and children questioning my
 
02:15:17.069 --> 02:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
presence in a women's room why is that
 
02:15:19.149 --> 02:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
man in here would be irrelevant and
 
02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
innocent question as I am a man I do not
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
see how this could be construed as
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
protecting my own or others privacy
 
02:15:28.589 --> 02:15:28.599 align:start position:0%
rights or physical safety notably my
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
presence in a men's room has never been
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
questioned or been an issue in the years
 
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
since my transition I know that I am
 
02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
very lucky as a trans man I pass very
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
well walking down the street people
 
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
cannot tell that the gender I identify
 
02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
as does not align with the sex I was
 
02:15:44.350 --> 02:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
assigned at Birth others do not have it
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
so easy many trans non-binary and
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
intersex folk face hatred and danger
 
02:15:51.069 --> 02:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
just by leaving their houses each day
 
02:15:52.990 --> 02:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
bills like hp48 would allow
 
02:15:54.910 --> 02:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on gender and sex
 
02:15:57.149 --> 02:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
but only when they do not align gender
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
and sex do not have to align if they did
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
we would only have one word for both IC
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
bills and policies like HB 148 is
 
02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
snowballs which if allowed to roll will
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
allow for the passage of more extreme
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
more harmful and more hateful policies
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
policies that would endanger your
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
constituent's health and well-being
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
please stop this before it starts please
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
vote no on
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
you at this point I'm going to recess
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 148 and open
 
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 580 and I'm
 
02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:33.880 align:start position:0%

02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
12th at 10:15 a.m. so if you're here to
 
02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill 580 that has been
 
02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
recessed to March 12th at 10:15
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
a.m. I'm going to open reopen the
 
02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 148 and recognize
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:02.429 --> 02:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
Carson thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:17:03.870 --> 02:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is David
 
02:17:05.429 --> 02:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
Trumble I'm from the town of wear and I
 
02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill the prime sponsor said
 
02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill is good because it
 
02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't require discrimination it allows
 
02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable latitude but what the bill
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
really does it sets up a legal framework
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
that would permit any organization in
 
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
this state public or private to
 
02:17:23.549 --> 02:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
discriminate the state's job is not to
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
take away civil rights but to protect
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
civil rights and you can only take away
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
civil rights if you have compelling
 
02:17:31.870 --> 02:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that it is necessary and that
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
there is no less restrictive alternative
 
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
the law also serves the purpose to
 
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
educate the public if we keep the 2018
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
law in effect we are telling the people
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
of the state that transgender people are
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
welcome here that they have much to
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
offer and they we believe in them and if
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
you have listened to the testimony today
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
in all of the past hearing you'll know
 
02:17:53.709 --> 02:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
that the transgender people have spoke
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
with decency respect and intelligence
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
they are valuable members of our society
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
we have nothing to fear from them
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
however if you pass this bill you're
 
02:18:03.870 --> 02:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
telling the people of our state that
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
there are two classes of citizens in
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
this state two sets of civil rights and
 
02:18:10.509 --> 02:18:10.519 align:start position:0%
that discrimination is acceptable but
 
02:18:12.070 --> 02:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
what about the Civil Rights of a person
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
who wants to go to a public hearing and
 
02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
can't use a bathroom you are taking away
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
their free association and their free
 
02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
speech what if they want to be a
 
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
legislator how could they be here all
 
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
day if they could never use a bathroom
 
02:18:25.469 --> 02:18:25.479 align:start position:0%

really how Society treats them that
 
02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
would be counter to their treatment what
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
about the Civil Rights of a transgender
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
woman who was sent to a male's prison
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
and has a 60% rate of being raped what
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
about their civil rights what about the
 
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
rights of children who just want to
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
compete in sports there are other ways
 
02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
you can solve this problem there are
 
02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
less restrictive Alternatives you can
 
02:18:53.790 --> 02:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
have non-gender specific bathrooms you
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
could have different policies than there
 
02:18:57.709 --> 02:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
are many as been mentioned in sports
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
there are less restrictive Alternatives
 
02:19:01.309 --> 02:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
there is no compelling State interest
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
here it's your job to protect our civil
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%

02:19:06.309 --> 02:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank
 
02:19:08.589 --> 02:19:08.599 align:start position:0%
you drew
 
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
lipet good
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Drew Carson um I live
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
in Dover now but I was born and
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
conquered and grew up in
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
Chichester I went to St John's and
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
Bishop Brady and survived 12 years of
 
02:19:29.639 --> 02:19:30.629 align:start position:0%
Bishop Brady and survived 12 years of
Catholic

02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
Catholic
 
02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
school after a brief uh time in Maine
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
for college and grad school in Vermont I
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
came back to New Hampshire to live and
 
02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
to work and I'm a transgender man I'm
 
02:19:44.589 --> 02:19:44.599 align:start position:0%
here to strongly oppose House Bill
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
148 I knew that I was transgender from
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
approximately age five and that is
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
because gender identity lives in our
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
brains and so that is how we all know
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
what our gender is whether you're a
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
transgender or not transgender and you
 
02:20:00.910 --> 02:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
cannot tell what is in someone else's
 
02:20:03.630 --> 02:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
brain simply by looking at them just
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
like you can't tell what someone's
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
genitals are when they are in public and
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
they are covered up and we should not
 
02:20:12.750 --> 02:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
even be striving to know this
 
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
information about other people about
 
02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:16.710 align:start position:0%
information about other people about
other

02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
strangers and that is what this bill is
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
about it's about strangers is looking at
 
02:20:23.469 --> 02:20:23.479 align:start position:0%
someone else and thinking they know
 
02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
better what our gender identity and what
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
our genitals
 
02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
are and it's ironic that it's always
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
cisgendered heterosexual people who are
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
obsessed with what other people's
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
identity and genitals look
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
like transgender people are not
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
criminals there's no evidence that we
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
are causing any issues in the bathrooms
 
02:20:48.270 --> 02:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
or in locker rooms in fact we are much
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
more likely to be the victims in
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and locker
 
02:20:56.349 --> 02:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
rooms last week and again
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
today someone testified about little
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
boys using the boys's bathroom at school
 
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
and being concerned because someone that
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
they perceived to be a little girl was
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
in there when in fact that was a
 
02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:10.309 align:start position:0%
in there when in fact that was a
transgender

02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
02:21:13.469 --> 02:21:13.479 align:start position:0%
boy and I left after hearing that last
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
week just thinking wouldn't it be nice
 
02:21:19.150 --> 02:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
if instead the parents message to their
 
02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
children was I apologize but that's your
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
time okay thank you thank
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
Peters good morning committee members
 
02:21:42.190 --> 02:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
and chairperson um I'm Lyn lipid a
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
resident of Milford and I have
 
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
transgendered family and friends who are
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
at risk of being harmed if this bill is
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
passed this bill removed freedoms and
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
inflicts harm on a vulnerable group of
 
02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
people that have been protected by New
 
02:21:58.349 --> 02:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's anti-discrimination laws for
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
years based on the due diligence of
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
Prior legislators and the support of the
 
02:22:04.990 --> 02:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
citizens the fear that an individual
 
02:22:09.630 --> 02:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
might cause harm is not a reason to deny
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
a group of people their freedom and
 
02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
liberty girls and women can protect
 
02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
their privacy by using single stalls and
 
02:22:17.349 --> 02:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
changing areas in bathrooms and locker
 
02:22:19.550 --> 02:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
rooms it seems the real issue is that
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
some people are simply uncomfortable
 
02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
with the idea of using the same
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
facilities as someone of the same gender
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
who may not have the same body parts
 
02:22:29.469 --> 02:22:29.479 align:start position:0%
that they
 
02:22:32.349 --> 02:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
do but how will they know this whose
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
privacy is being violated to find out
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's not possible to know someone's sex
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
assigned at Birth by how they look this
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill encourages anyone to violate the
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
privacy of anyone else because they feel
 
02:22:46.429 --> 02:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable this is not a case of
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
protecting equal concerns it is Comfort
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
versus safety the result of passing HB
 
02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
148 will be to put the majority of
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
transgender and non-binary People In
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way in order for a few people to
 
02:23:01.389 --> 02:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
feel more
 
02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable there is no way to enforce
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
this bill without an invasion of privacy
 
02:23:07.469 --> 02:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
the very thing this bill wants to
 
02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
curtail this bill allows anyone to
 
02:23:11.790 --> 02:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
legitimately question someone's sex at
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
Birth based on what they look like this
 
02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
power can be used to harass and
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
intimidate cisgendered people as well as
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
transgendered and non-binary people
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
legislation limiting participation in
 
02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
sports based on sex assigned at Birth is
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
not right or the best mechanism to
 
02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
ensure girls and women can safely
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
participate in sports funding for proper
 
02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
coaching equipment and supervision for
 
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
sports will have a much greater impact
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
for these reasons I oppose HB 148 and
 
02:23:42.990 --> 02:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
any similar bill and I urge you and
 
02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:44.760 align:start position:0%

legislation however to do that I want to
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%

02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:04.830 align:start position:0%

regarding

02:27:04.830 --> 02:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
02:27:07.070 --> 02:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
homosexuality and current treatment
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
regarding trans people I'd like to share
 
02:27:13.550 --> 02:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
something about myself is that I was uh
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
male representing in high school I was
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
afraid to even tell people I was queer
 
02:27:19.389 --> 02:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
or bisexual but regardless of these
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
facts I have been assaulted in boy
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
locker rooms in high school and I've
 
02:27:26.110 --> 02:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
been sexually assaulted in a men's
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
bathroom as an adult and I cannot even
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
begin to tell you how dangerous it is
 
02:27:33.870 --> 02:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
and how afraid I am personally to enter
 
02:27:36.269 --> 02:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
a men's bathroom in my current
 
02:27:38.830 --> 02:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
presentation much of which is physically
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
transformed due to HRT and the
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
medication I take for my transition I
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
can't just undo it I can take my makeup
 
02:27:48.910 --> 02:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
off I cannot restore fat deposits in my
 
02:27:51.309 --> 02:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
body temporarily to make myself look
 
02:27:51.319 --> 02:27:52.790 align:start position:0%
body temporarily to make myself look
less

02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
less
 
02:27:55.150 --> 02:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
feminine I just really hope that
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
everyone here who makes a decision on
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
this bill does so with love in their
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
hearts and empathy for not just s
 
02:28:05.349 --> 02:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
gendered women but for me for my people
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
for queer for Trans folks of the State
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire who need your
 
02:28:13.230 --> 02:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
protection and are in danger if the
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
right to discriminate is given to the
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
individuals the business and the
 
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
legislation the schools and the prisons
 
02:28:22.269 --> 02:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
and in the future it is not
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
safe that's it I don't even need the
 
02:28:26.190 --> 02:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
full 2 minutes I don't know if that was
 
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
2 minutes but that's what I have to
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
share I have submitted my testimony
 
02:28:32.830 --> 02:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
online great thank you thank
 
02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
you Carol Pickford followed by
 
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
GES hi yeah um my name is Carol Pickford
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
I'm from Allenstown and I'm here
 
02:28:49.150 --> 02:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill as a transgender
 
02:28:51.349 --> 02:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
individual the propos law threatens my
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
dignity safety and rights coming out of
 
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
the closet um then trying to get to uh
 
02:28:58.590 --> 02:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
go back into it is a lot like trying to
 
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
put toothpaste back in the tube 10 years
 
02:29:03.150 --> 02:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
ago I made the choice to live my life as
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
a woman and that choice has had
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
irreversible consequences including the
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
shattering of many long-standing
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
previous relationships in the time since
 
02:29:12.670 --> 02:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
I have worked hard to gain respect and
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
acceptance from my peers I I didn't
 
02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
choose uh my innate physical
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
characteristics and I can assure you
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
that it is something that makes me more
 
02:29:21.670 --> 02:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable every day than it does
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else around me to say that my
 
02:29:25.950 --> 02:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
presence in the women's washroom somehow
 
02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
affects the safety of others around me
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
is denigrating beyond belief while the
 
02:29:31.269 --> 02:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't use these words
 
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
specifically it's clear such language
 
02:29:35.389 --> 02:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
makes out transgender people such as
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
myself to be rapists and predators not
 
02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
only is such an assertion patently false
 
02:29:41.309 --> 02:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
it's an assault on my dignity and
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
threatens to to erase that respect which
 
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
I have worked so hard to build before
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
attending law school I wrote magazine
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
articles covering a variety of
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
transgender related topics
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
one such topic I covered in depth was
 
02:29:54.030 --> 02:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
transgender prison reform under the
 
02:29:55.950 --> 02:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration and what brought it
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
about one of the cases I covered was
 
02:30:00.990 --> 02:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
Raven V polus in Colorado where 160
 
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
trans women incarcerated in male prisons
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
sue the state their assertions included
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
but were by no means limited to sexual
 
02:30:09.870 --> 02:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
harassment by prisoners and guards being
 
02:30:11.950 --> 02:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
raped by prisoners and guards being
 
02:30:13.870 --> 02:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
forcibly tattooed by male prisoners and
 
02:30:16.389 --> 02:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
treated as property and more I'm happy
 
02:30:18.150 --> 02:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
to say that Raven V polus had a good
 
02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
ending involving the gradual integration
 
02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
of trans women into women's correctional
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
facilities but today I stand Here
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
speaking against a bill proposing to
 
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
open the door to doing the opposite
 
02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
prisons for trans women especially have
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
historically been a place of violence
 
02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
and Trauma outside the public eye and
 
02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
Consciousness putting transgender women
 
02:30:37.269 --> 02:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
in men's prisons constitutes cruel and
 
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
unusual punishment and forces the state
 
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
to uh choose between housing them in the
 
02:30:43.070 --> 02:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
general population where they are
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
frequently raped or isolating them for
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
indefinite periods of time uh I
 
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
apologize but that's your time uh please
 
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
please uh post Bill thank you thank
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
you Katie
 
02:31:04.349 --> 02:31:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
Smith hi I'm Katie Remish I'm from
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hollis and I grew up next door in BO I
 
02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
am opposed to this bill people will
 
02:31:14.349 --> 02:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
speak and have spoken about the science
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
and morality and opposition to this
 
02:31:17.870 --> 02:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
issue and I will try to appeal to your
 
02:31:20.309 --> 02:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
hearts to paraphrase a testimony I heard
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill and Simo bills
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
here and in the Senate session last week
 
02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
a boy little boy fifth grade maybe walks
 
02:31:28.750 --> 02:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
into a school bathroom and discover
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
someone he had believed to be female in
 
02:31:33.309 --> 02:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
the boy's bathroom he is uncomfortable
 
02:31:35.309 --> 02:31:35.319 align:start position:0%
confused and has not encountered this
 
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
before so he returns to class and
 
02:31:38.830 --> 02:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
refuses to use the bathroom for the rest
 
02:31:41.389 --> 02:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
of the day or any day going forward this
 
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:45.160 align:start position:0%
is awful I feel for this child no child
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
should feel uncomfortable using the
 
02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
bathroom at school but those are the
 
02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
feelings and this is the story of every
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
trans child every day when they cannot
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
use the bathroom that aligns with their
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
gender this is every trans kid the boy
 
02:31:59.910 --> 02:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the story was told he could get
 
02:32:02.230 --> 02:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
permission to use a special bathroom
 
02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
this was upsetting to him and his
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
parents rightly so no child should have
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
to feel negatively singled out but trans
 
02:32:11.710 --> 02:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
children are often told they have to use
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
a different or special bathroom in the
 
02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
school we are parents we want all your
 
02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
children to be happy why can't everyone
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
empathize with trans kids this choice
 
02:32:25.070 --> 02:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
right here choosing between two groups
 
02:32:27.309 --> 02:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
of people cisgender and trans is the
 
02:32:29.710 --> 02:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
problem instead look at this situation
 
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
as a teachable moment how do you resolve
 
02:32:34.429 --> 02:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
problems between kids you sit them down
 
02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
and you talk it out you teach them to
 
02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
show kindness to one another teach them
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
about pronouns and non-binary and gender
 
02:32:43.150 --> 02:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
expression and gender identity so there
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
is no confusion the fifth grade boy now
 
02:32:47.389 --> 02:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
knows that trans people exist and they
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
are normal and they are good he is no
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
longer on un comfortable in the bathroom
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
he has learned that it is okay that it
 
02:32:55.110 --> 02:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
is acceptable and when he encounters the
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
situation again because he will trans
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
people are everywhere he won't give it a
 
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
second thought open conversations solve
 
02:33:05.710 --> 02:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
this problem not banss not
 
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
ostracization please oppose this Bill
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you perfect timing thank
 
02:33:18.510 --> 02:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
you Jennifer Smith followed by posher
 
02:33:21.269 --> 02:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
Roberts hi Jennifer Smith from penbroke
 
02:33:23.950 --> 02:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony um
 
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
almost all of what I would say has been
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
said many times um and I just would
 
02:33:32.590 --> 02:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
reinforce that I I did send you um email
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning um I included my
 
02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
email at the end of it in case you don't
 
02:33:41.190 --> 02:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
see it up the top for some reason and I
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
would love to answer questions I am
 
02:33:46.950 --> 02:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
Christian and I am a medical doctor and
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
both of those things are important to me
 
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
um and I just listening to that right
 
02:33:56.590 --> 02:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
now I want to talk about the fact that
 
02:33:59.710 --> 02:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
when I was first in kindergarten some
 
02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
older boys thought I didn't belong in
 
02:34:04.870 --> 02:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
the bathroom and I messed myself for a
 
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
while after that because I didn't think
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
I should be going there for the next 40
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
years I worked hard at acting the part
 
02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
and I did a pretty successful job and
 
02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
you know I thought when puberty hit I'd
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
be fine you know I'd turn into a guy and
 
02:34:25.230 --> 02:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy with it I never was and um
 
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
by the time I was in my mid-40s and
 
02:34:30.269 --> 02:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
things had not been going well I got
 
02:34:32.269 --> 02:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
some counseling and I began to think
 
02:34:35.670 --> 02:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
about things and I got a long way along
 
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
and then I was in the midst because I
 
02:34:40.030 --> 02:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
love scripture reading Matthew from
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
front to back and discovered that there
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
really not is not only anything against
 
02:34:48.429 --> 02:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
there being more than one gender in the
 
02:34:51.309 --> 02:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
gospel but Jesus actually talks about
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
people who were born Unix and people who
 
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
chose to be Unix for the sake of the
 
02:34:58.830 --> 02:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
kingdom of
 
02:35:02.070 --> 02:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
God and that really hit me hard and said
 
02:35:05.710 --> 02:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
yeah this transition stuff is real and I
 
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
need to do it and I have been much
 
02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
happier as anybody can attest since that
 
02:35:14.349 --> 02:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
time and um in the last several years
 
02:35:18.110 --> 02:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
I've been back to playing tennis and uh
 
02:35:20.670 --> 02:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
I play on a woman's team and I assure
 
02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
you I am not the strongest the fastest I
 
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
apologize but that's your time limit
 
02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
okay and I be happy to answer questions
 
02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
about any of the medical aspects that
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
have been brought up and um any other
 
02:35:36.590 --> 02:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
questions you have I have a lot of
 
02:35:39.070 --> 02:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
experience in a lot of
 
02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:02.830 --> 02:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
Wall hello um honorable members of the
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee I'm posha Roberts
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
from Wilman New Hampshire and I'm on the
 
02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
board of 603 equality and I'm speaking
 
02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:11.590 align:start position:0%
board of 603 equality and I'm speaking
against

02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
hp48 uh there is a moral panic in this
 
02:36:18.590 --> 02:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
country around transgender people the
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
idea of this bill
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
is to return to simpler times to
 
02:36:26.349 --> 02:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
biological sex the bill does not define
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
biological sex really so we're
 
02:36:31.230 --> 02:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
encouraged to use common sense and I
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
take that to mean
 
02:36:35.309 --> 02:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
genitals I'm here to remind you that
 
02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
nature is not so simple or comforting I
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
was born into a category known as
 
02:36:45.990 --> 02:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
intersex not exactly male or female at
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
Birth the truth is it's not genitals
 
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's not the big cell and the little
 
02:36:54.670 --> 02:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
cell it's not even xx and XY there is no
 
02:36:58.110 --> 02:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
easy definition for sex I know many
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
people who are born with female genitals
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
but are
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
XY I know people who carry two DNA types
 
02:37:11.469 --> 02:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
both XX and XY they absorbed a twin I
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
know people whose chromosomes are xxy or
 
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
XXX or just X I've even met people with
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
one ovary and one testicle and people
 
02:37:20.429 --> 02:37:20.439 align:start position:0%
who were born born with
 
02:37:23.790 --> 02:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
none there are 35 Medical variations or
 
02:37:26.190 --> 02:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
ways that a baby can be born intersex
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
like me there's no bright line nature is
 
02:37:33.230 --> 02:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
wild this isn't woke this is just how
 
02:37:36.429 --> 02:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
bodies go how babies are born in
 
02:37:38.269 --> 02:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
response to the challenge of my body I
 
02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
was put through two difficult surgeries
 
02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
as a child to conform me to be male they
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
rebuilt me so I could look the way they
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
wanted and use a bathroom the way that
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
they wanted I was a triangular Peg and
 
02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
they jammed me into a square
 
02:37:59.630 --> 02:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
hole pretty darn hard this bill is based
 
02:38:03.389 --> 02:38:03.399 align:start position:0%
on a flawed non-de of biological sex I
 
02:38:05.269 --> 02:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
apologize about that your time if a bill
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
is based on easily disproven medical
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
itl BJ
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:25.150 --> 02:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
hi my name is BJ wall I live in Sullivan
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is near Keane and I
 
02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill on so many things but
 
02:38:32.590 --> 02:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
most of the people who have come before
 
02:38:34.469 --> 02:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
me have already said them so I'm just
 
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
going to keep it very brief I have two
 
02:38:39.309 --> 02:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
trans grandsons whom I love very much
 
02:38:42.190 --> 02:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
the older one who is at UNH and will
 
02:38:44.429 --> 02:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
graduate next year looks like a lot of
 
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
the other trans men and he has a full
 
02:38:49.269 --> 02:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
beard and he's a little Hefty and I
 
02:38:51.469 --> 02:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
think I think if he goes in the women's
 
02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
bathroom where he would be required by
 
02:38:56.110 --> 02:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
this law to do so that the women are
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to get a little upset when they
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
see him in there and I think if their
 
02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
husbands are waiting in the hall they're
 
02:39:03.309 --> 02:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
going to say what are you doing and
 
02:39:05.469 --> 02:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
maybe pull him aside and maybe hurt him
 
02:39:07.150 --> 02:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't want him to get hurt
 
02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the other part of this is
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
sports sports have never been fair and
 
02:39:14.950 --> 02:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
never will be fair because everybody's
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
body type is totally different I think
 
02:39:22.429 --> 02:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
of um the swimmer Michael Phelps who was
 
02:39:25.269 --> 02:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
not only had a great wingspan and a and
 
02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
a huge long body but was uh hyper had
 
02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
hyperextensive joints and double
 
02:39:34.030 --> 02:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
jointedness he won all the races CU his
 
02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
body was just better adapted for
 
02:39:39.309 --> 02:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
swimming than anyone else and most trans
 
02:39:42.349 --> 02:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
women who have been on HRT
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
therapy for a few years act more like
 
02:39:49.469 --> 02:39:49.479 align:start position:0%
women physically than they do like men
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's an N issue as well
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's very dangerous to put trans
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
women in a Men's
 
02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
prison I think this bill really needs to
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
be ited
 
02:40:03.070 --> 02:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
thanks thank
 
02:40:05.190 --> 02:40:05.200 align:start position:0%

Dole followed by Eileen sahajan
 
02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%

to sit here and receive the the passion
 
02:40:21.790 --> 02:40:21.800 align:start position:0%

02:40:22.990 --> 02:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
kind of bring sometimes so thank you
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
very much U my name is Kaden I'm a grad
 
02:40:27.150 --> 02:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
student at UNH and I've lived back and
 
02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
forth across the Vermont New Hampshire
 
02:40:30.389 --> 02:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
border my whole life I'm here today
 
02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
because I care about the safety of the
 
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
women and girls in my community and I
 
02:40:35.150 --> 02:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
have three younger sisters and I want
 
02:40:37.349 --> 02:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
them to be safe in the bathroom so I'll
 
02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
start by asking what bathroom do you
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
think I belong in would a woman feel
 
02:40:43.950 --> 02:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
safe if I entered the women's bathroom
 
02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
do I belong in a woman's restroom no
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm a man clearly right I'm not
 
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
a woman when I was born the doctor
 
02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
handed me to my parents and said
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
congratulations it's a girl 22 years
 
02:40:55.150 --> 02:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
later after living as the girl I was
 
02:40:58.030 --> 02:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
born as I started my transition I am
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
transgender if you want this bill to
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
pass you want me in a women's restroom
 
02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill will allow it's
 
02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
not enforceable to try to figure out who
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
is Trans in what bathroom uh all women
 
02:41:10.510 --> 02:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
will be subject to questions simply
 
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
because they don't look girly enough do
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
you want someone checking if your
 
02:41:17.309 --> 02:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
daughter is in the right
 
02:41:19.630 --> 02:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
bathroom that uh that makes a bathroom
 
02:41:21.309 --> 02:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
more dangerous for women and girls
 
02:41:23.349 --> 02:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to a mom who's by
 
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
herself with a 2-year-old little boy
 
02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
that little 2-year-old's got to stay
 
02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
outside the bathroom that's dangerous uh
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
bathrooms are uncomfortable for all of
 
02:41:31.630 --> 02:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
us I'm uncomfortable in the bathroom
 
02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
with you there too um instead of
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
scapegoating trans people as the source
 
02:41:37.150 --> 02:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
of that problem let's talk about the
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
real problem which is that whoever
 
02:41:41.030 --> 02:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
designed bathrooms was a super villain
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
they're awful they are uncomfortable um
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
so let's decide here together to
 
02:41:47.950 --> 02:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
legislate bathrooms to be built better
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
rather than to legislate to discriminate
 
02:41:51.870 --> 02:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
against trans people with that I just
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
kindly ask you to oppose this bill uh
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I am here to voice my
 
02:42:34.150 --> 02:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB
 
02:42:38.030 --> 02:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
148 I was a teacher for 46 years and I
 
02:42:41.070 --> 02:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
apologize if I morph into my teacher
 
02:42:43.030 --> 02:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
voice but it's
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
coming I had the honor and privilege of
 
02:42:48.309 --> 02:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
working with many beautiful trans
 
02:42:48.319 --> 02:42:49.990 align:start position:0%
working with many beautiful trans
students

02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps you do not know what life is
 
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
really like for most trans people it
 
02:43:01.150 --> 02:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
usually takes many years to realize that
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
you are in the body of the wrong gender
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
there are years and years of counseling
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
and the awful awful proven truth about
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
being trans is this I will say it loudly
 
02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:14.630 align:start position:0%
being trans is this I will say it loudly
and

02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
slowly people in this situation are
 
02:43:22.110 --> 02:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
often suicide Idol for
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
years imagine being the loved one of
 
02:43:26.510 --> 02:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
someone who has suffered and suffered
 
02:43:29.230 --> 02:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
for years imagine being that person who
 
02:43:32.429 --> 02:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
has suffered when a transperson who is
 
02:43:35.150 --> 02:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
finally realigning their body to match
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
who they are eventually feels
 
02:43:39.309 --> 02:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable to go in public and is
 
02:43:42.190 --> 02:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
finally happy there is absolutely no
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
reason to afflict upon them the anxiety
 
02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
of not even being able to use the
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
bathroom without fear
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
using the bathroom is a basic bodily
 
02:43:55.550 --> 02:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
function imagine if someone said to you
 
02:43:58.590 --> 02:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative you may not use this
 
02:44:01.309 --> 02:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
bathroom there is absolutely no evidence
 
02:44:03.230 --> 02:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
that trans women are a threatened
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
bathrooms with this proposed legislation
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
we are putting fragile frightened and
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable People In Harm's Way and we
 
02:44:14.349 --> 02:44:14.359 align:start position:0%

02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
inspectors this legislation is cruel and
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%

many ways helped me recognize and
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%

02:45:25.550 --> 02:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
identity uh my son is by far one of the
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
most considerate and caring thoughtful
 
02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
kind funny and wildly creative humans

courageous to be coming into the world
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
just fully willing to uh be himself in
 
02:45:42.399 --> 02:45:43.469 align:start position:0%
just fully willing to uh be himself in
this

02:45:43.469 --> 02:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
world I'm beyond grateful for the
 
02:45:47.790 --> 02:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
support he's re received on his journey
 
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
and some of the folks I my deepest
 
02:45:51.750 --> 02:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
thanks to are here in the building
 
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
today uh as you may have guessed I'm
 
02:45:56.309 --> 02:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
here to speak in opposition to this bill
 
02:45:58.429 --> 02:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
I ask you to carefully consider the harm
 
02:45:59.870 --> 02:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
such a decision would cause to the
 
02:46:02.309 --> 02:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
transgender community and Beyond and to
 
02:46:04.110 --> 02:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
the broader values of equality and
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
justice in our
 
02:46:08.190 --> 02:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
state in my personal experience
 
02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
recognizing the difference between
 
02:46:11.469 --> 02:46:11.479 align:start position:0%
gender which I Now understand as a
 
02:46:14.910 --> 02:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
construct and sex assigned at Birth and
 
02:46:16.510 --> 02:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
and how so many of us are completely
 
02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
crushed by the conflation of the two has
 
02:46:20.910 --> 02:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
been heartbreaking and simultaneously
 
02:46:22.910 --> 02:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
hopeful as there have become more and
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
more ways of expressing identity that
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
allow the two things to be more aligned
 
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
when previously they were not looking
 
02:46:30.389 --> 02:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
back at my own journey I see things so
 
02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
much more clearly now that I understand
 
02:46:34.030 --> 02:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
Who I Am from the inside and way that
 
02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
and the way that conflicts with what
 
02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
I've been taught and how I've been
 
02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
treated based on physical
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the body I was born
 
02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
into the trajectory of my internal
 
02:46:44.830 --> 02:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
Journey could have been so much more
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
peaceful had I the language to
 
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
understand this at an earlier age and
 
02:46:50.590 --> 02:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
the support Express express myself
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%

148 um so I am a Vermont resident uh I

Hampshire uh currently I do all of my
 
02:47:35.790 --> 02:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
shopping in New Hampshire although uh
 
02:47:37.309 --> 02:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
we'll see how things go in the next few
 
02:47:40.910 --> 02:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
years um I also have been an advocate
 
02:47:42.990 --> 02:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
for gender inclusive restroom access for
 
02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
over six years uh what that means is
 
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
I've become very familiar with building
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
codes um if any of you have read uh New
 
02:47:53.269 --> 02:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Building Code um which
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
you really should it's fascinating um
 
02:47:56.520 --> 02:47:57.950 align:start position:0%
you really should it's fascinating um
any

02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
multi-user uh public restroom facility
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
with very limited exceptions is
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
currently required to be marked by a
 
02:48:06.750 --> 02:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
sign that says men or women uh I have
 
02:48:09.150 --> 02:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
complicated feelings about this policy
 
02:48:11.950 --> 02:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that has been the policy
 
02:48:14.349 --> 02:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
and the Assumption has always been up
 
02:48:17.110 --> 02:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
until 2018 that the way the separation
 
02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
of genders and restrooms would be
 
02:48:18.319 --> 02:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
of genders and restrooms would be
enforced

02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
02:48:23.190 --> 02:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
would be by random people using the
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
restroom to assess whether other people
 
02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the restroom match the sign on the
 
02:48:29.790 --> 02:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
door or not that was the
 
02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
Assumption finally in
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
2018 trans people in New Hampshire got
 
02:48:39.630 --> 02:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
some protection against being harassed
 
02:48:42.269 --> 02:48:42.279 align:start position:0%
out of the restroom the only thing this
 
02:48:44.670 --> 02:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
bill would accomplish is to bring that
 
02:48:47.469 --> 02:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
back um and I want to be clear uh I
 
02:48:49.150 --> 02:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
speak on the Wern portion of this bill
 
02:48:50.910 --> 02:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
because that is something that I am very
 
02:48:53.230 --> 02:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with I oppose all aspects of
 
02:48:55.389 --> 02:48:55.399 align:start position:0%
this bill uh the other portions
 
02:48:59.150 --> 02:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
targeting uh trans people in uh prisons
 
02:49:01.710 --> 02:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
and trans people in psychiatric
 
02:49:04.590 --> 02:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
facilities are blatantly
 
02:49:10.269 --> 02:49:10.279 align:start position:0%
cruel uh this this bill is a bill about
 
02:49:13.150 --> 02:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
harassing trans people thank is your
 
02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:17.080 align:start position:0%

02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
horse hello first time um Dear honorable
 
02:49:36.229 --> 02:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
members of the Judiciary Committee my
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
name is Stacy Esposito I'm a resident of
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
Brooklyn and I'm here in opposition of
 
02:49:43.030 --> 02:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
HB 148 as a mental health professional
 
02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
and practice owner with Advanced degrees
 
02:49:47.429 --> 02:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
in both research and Clinical Psychology
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
I speak to you from both scientif ific
 
02:49:52.190 --> 02:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
and clinical perspectives HP 148 is
 
02:49:53.429 --> 02:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
based on the false premise that
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
transgender people do not exist a claim
 
02:49:57.550 --> 02:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
that is not only inhumane but factually
 
02:49:59.469 --> 02:49:59.479 align:start position:0%
incorrect the existence of trans
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
identity is widely recognized as a
 
02:50:03.429 --> 02:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
fundamental part of human diversity by
 
02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of academics and
 
02:50:07.710 --> 02:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
professionals the few who deny this are
 
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
dismissed within the scientific
 
02:50:10.990 --> 02:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
communities for pushing baseless
 
02:50:13.349 --> 02:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
ideology attempting to legislate people
 
02:50:15.710 --> 02:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
out of existence does not erase them it
 
02:50:18.030 --> 02:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
denies reality and hurts people I've
 
02:50:19.950 --> 02:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
worked closely with transgender adults
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
children and families and I'm deeply
 
02:50:23.309 --> 02:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about the harm this bill will
 
02:50:25.790 --> 02:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
cause in supporting trans clients I've
 
02:50:27.190 --> 02:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
learned so much about our shared
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
Humanity I've seen heartbreak and
 
02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
humility grief and courage pain and
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
perseverance self-doubt and
 
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
self-awareness and a fight for oneself
 
02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
cuz there is no other way shockingly
 
02:50:41.110 --> 02:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
enough I haven't heard any processing
 
02:50:42.830 --> 02:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
related to trying to creep into bathroom
 
02:50:44.990 --> 02:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
stalls but I have heard heartbreak from
 
02:50:46.389 --> 02:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
a client that was unable to join a
 
02:50:48.309 --> 02:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
sports team and had to surrender the
 
02:50:50.710 --> 02:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
sport altogether due to policy a loss
 
02:50:52.590 --> 02:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
they had to take to fight for themselves
 
02:50:55.150 --> 02:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
but a loss nonetheless regardless of
 
02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
what you all think and how this bill
 
02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
pans out people are still going to come
 
02:51:00.190 --> 02:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
to me exploring their gender identity
 
02:51:02.110 --> 02:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
trans identity isn't going away but if
 
02:51:03.870 --> 02:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
this bill passes people are going to get
 
02:51:06.150 --> 02:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
hurt bills like this endorse violence
 
02:51:08.229 --> 02:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
through forced outing placing an already
 
02:51:10.269 --> 02:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population at significantly
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
higher risk bullying is already a
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
significant problem my clients face at
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
school and I'm legitimately worried
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
about their safety being enclosed in
 
02:51:20.229 --> 02:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
spaces simply trying to use the bathroom
 
02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
if we're concerned about fairness in
 
02:51:24.030 --> 02:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
sports or safety and shared spaces let's
 
02:51:25.710 --> 02:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
engage in nuanced evidence-based
 
02:51:27.389 --> 02:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
discussions not broad policies that
 
02:51:29.269 --> 02:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
erase the existence of an entire
 
02:51:31.229 --> 02:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
population history has shown us what
 
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
happens when we legislate against
 
02:51:34.269 --> 02:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
marginalized communi I apologize but
 
02:51:37.429 --> 02:51:37.439 align:start position:0%

you thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:51:57.349 --> 02:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Jonah Sutton
 
02:51:59.429 --> 02:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
Morse I live in Canterbury New Hampshire
 
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify against this
 
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill I want to start by affirming that
 
02:52:06.910 --> 02:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
trans men are men trans women are women
 
02:52:10.229 --> 02:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
trans non-binary people exist I'm here
 
02:52:13.550 --> 02:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
today as a parent uh my kids are no
 
02:52:15.349 --> 02:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
longer at the point where we're doing
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
potty training and getting out of potty
 
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
training but recently enough that I
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
remember that one of the really
 
02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
important questions planning a trip is
 
02:52:24.990 --> 02:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
what do I do if my kid says Daddy I have
 
02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
to go potty right
 
02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
now access to public restrooms is access
 
02:52:33.150 --> 02:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
to public spaces and what this bill says
 
02:52:35.309 --> 02:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
is anybody who has control over the
 
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
signage on public restrooms can tell
 
02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
trans people you are icky and not wanted
 
02:52:44.110 --> 02:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
here I understand why a lot of the
 
02:52:46.190 --> 02:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
discussions about athletic competitions
 
02:52:48.750 --> 02:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
has been about high school sports
 
02:52:50.309 --> 02:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
as a former High School swimmer I have
 
02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
some thoughts about that but also last
 
02:52:53.870 --> 02:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
year I didn't do any High School sports
 
02:52:56.790 --> 02:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
I went to a charity 5k with my kids and
 
02:52:59.469 --> 02:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
some colleagues I went to Canter's toown
 
02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
Fair it's always the last Saturday in
 
02:53:04.349 --> 02:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
July and my kids did the obstacle course
 
02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
those are athletic or sporting events
 
02:53:07.870 --> 02:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
covered by the bill they're not about
 
02:53:10.670 --> 02:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
the outcome they're about participating
 
02:53:13.510 --> 02:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
in community what this bill would say is
 
02:53:16.389 --> 02:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
anybody who's organizing a 5k or a
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
Turkey Trot or an obstacle course
 
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
can tell trans people you are icky and
 
02:53:24.670 --> 02:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
not wanted here we know what to call the
 
02:53:26.469 --> 02:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
behavior of telling people you're icky
 
02:53:28.670 --> 02:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
and unwanted because of who you are we
 
02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
call it bigotry and we say it's wrong we
 
02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
know what to do when we encode that in
 
02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
legislation we call it state sponsored
 
02:53:40.030 --> 02:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination and we say it's
 
02:53:44.830 --> 02:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
wrong please vote itl in this Bill thank
 
02:53:49.150 --> 02:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:55.590 --> 02:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:00.030 --> 02:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
Stratton hey um I'm AJ I'm 19 I lived in
 
02:54:02.550 --> 02:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire my whole life um a lot of
 
02:54:05.790 --> 02:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
what I wrote down to say I feel like has
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
kind of already been said the first part
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
kind of just goes over how Ambiguously
 
02:54:12.670 --> 02:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
worded the bill is and how that could be
 
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
hold on I'll just read it real quick
 
02:54:16.590 --> 02:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the purpose of this bill comes
 
02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
across blatantly contradictory to the
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
first purpose of New Hampshire's law
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination it is a means to
 
02:54:22.910 --> 02:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
introduce unnecessary government control
 
02:54:24.510 --> 02:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the lives of citizens worded and
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic equivocation desperately
 
02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
framed to appear as altruism in the name
 
02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
of Public Safety um and yeah honestly I
 
02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
think it's dumb if I read the rest of it
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's all been said I I kind of just want
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
to tell you guys how I feel after
 
02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
sitting here the entire time um and
 
02:54:44.750 --> 02:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's sphere um I'll reiterate
 
02:54:46.429 --> 02:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
what someone said earlier which was
 
02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for for taking it all in cuz I
 
02:54:50.670 --> 02:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
mean like it's been a lot for me just
 
02:54:52.389 --> 02:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
sitting back there and this is your
 
02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
guys's job um I will add though maybe
 
02:54:56.349 --> 02:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
I'll need to get like a phone bin or
 
02:54:58.030 --> 02:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
something like that like how High School
 
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
classrooms have but um other than that
 
02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much um but witnessing
 
02:55:05.469 --> 02:55:05.479 align:start position:0%
everybody's fear even as somebody part
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the queer
 
02:55:09.429 --> 02:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
Community has shocked me like I know how
 
02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
scared we all are I think people some
 
02:55:13.990 --> 02:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
people are more scared than me I think
 
02:55:15.630 --> 02:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
I'm more privileged than some of those
 
02:55:16.950 --> 02:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
people who are more scared than me
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
because I I passed as they would say to
 
02:55:21.389 --> 02:55:21.399 align:start position:0%
walk into the men's bathroom and not be
 
02:55:23.269 --> 02:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
questioned I I don't really anticipate
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
that if this bill was passed it would
 
02:55:27.070 --> 02:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
really affect my daily life I think that
 
02:55:28.429 --> 02:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
the queer Community would push through
 
02:55:30.429 --> 02:55:30.439 align:start position:0%
like we always do but it creates a
 
02:55:32.190 --> 02:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
terrible world to live in like don't you
 
02:55:34.590 --> 02:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
guys all just want to live in a nice
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
place where people love and accept each
 
02:55:39.150 --> 02:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
other like I mean hearing the fear of
 
02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
the people who are are with this bill
 
02:55:43.550 --> 02:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
shook me because that is not an act like
 
02:55:45.269 --> 02:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
they're not rehearsing that crap like
 
02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
they're really terrified of gender
 
02:55:53.429 --> 02:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
men like harming them um and you know
 
02:55:56.910 --> 02:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
they may say that it is trans people but
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know whatever even if we disagree on
 
02:56:01.070 --> 02:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
on what they're afraid of like I feel
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
their time okay yeah I I would just say
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
consider everybody's fear and if and if
 
02:56:07.550 --> 02:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
you don't want New Hampshire to be a
 
02:56:10.469 --> 02:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
scary place oppose this bill

house hello everyone thank you excuse me
 
02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony my name is
 
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
Stephanie colie I live in Santa Conway
 
02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:58:51.630 --> 02:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
and I am here to oppose HB
 
02:58:55.469 --> 02:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
148 um the reason I I've been involved
 
02:58:58.070 --> 02:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the trans Rights Movement for quite a
 
02:59:01.950 --> 02:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
while um we were here back in 2017 and
 
02:59:03.630 --> 02:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
18 when finally we passed the
 
02:59:07.150 --> 02:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law um and I sat
 
02:59:09.429 --> 02:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
through countless hours of hearings and
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
meetings testifying Etc and um during
 
02:59:15.429 --> 02:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
that time we heard a lot of stories um
 
02:59:18.110 --> 02:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
hypothetical stories how if this pass
 
02:59:20.950 --> 02:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
they would open up um basically women's
 
02:59:23.590 --> 02:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
restrooms to predators and everything
 
02:59:27.030 --> 02:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
else we have real life not hypothetical
 
02:59:28.990 --> 02:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
but real life experience now to know
 
02:59:31.950 --> 02:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
after seven years since 2018 that that
 
02:59:34.790 --> 02:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
simply isn't true um so all the
 
02:59:37.670 --> 02:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
hypothetical fearmongering is really
 
02:59:39.870 --> 02:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
without Merit um so that would be the
 
02:59:41.710 --> 02:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
first point I would take the second
 
02:59:46.229 --> 02:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
point I would say is that um I don't
 
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
know I I would ask any of the women on
 
02:59:49.870 --> 02:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
this committee would you feel
 
02:59:52.190 --> 02:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable going into a men's room I
 
02:59:55.670 --> 02:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
certainly don't and if I if you don't
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
why would I um many of us have to use a
 
03:00:02.630 --> 03:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
women's restroom um and do it our
 
03:00:05.469 --> 03:00:05.479 align:start position:0%
medical transition I simply can't use a
 
03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
urino trust me it won't work so um again
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
I would respect have you be respectful
 
03:00:15.670 --> 03:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
of us human beings um another point is
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
again people have said this how will
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
this be enforced
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
birth certificates to get in and who
 
03:00:22.950 --> 03:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
else is going to be police it will be
 
03:00:27.110 --> 03:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
women who are tall short hear deep
 
03:00:29.269 --> 03:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
voices anybody who doesn't fit a
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
particular stereotype will be forced to
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
prove themselves and that is not a
 
03:00:37.590 --> 03:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
society I think we want to live in
 
03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
another point is think about if we do
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
this trans men now going to have to use
 
03:00:46.150 --> 03:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
the ladies room I apologize com that be
 
03:00:48.550 --> 03:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and again I UR you to
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%

03:01:26.910 --> 03:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
professionals across the grent state as
 
03:01:29.429 --> 03:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
well as uh Town employees we are here in
 
03:01:33.229 --> 03:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
opposition of H billb 148 um I just want
 
03:01:34.830 --> 03:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
to focus on a few points we oppose the
 
03:01:36.429 --> 03:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
whole bill but there's a few things that
 
03:01:38.710 --> 03:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh I want to make sure we say our public
 
03:01:42.349 --> 03:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
schools accept all students and uh we
 
03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
want we need to we have a responsibility
 
03:01:47.349 --> 03:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure they all feel included and
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
that they all feel they belong in our
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
schools all students should be able to
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
fully participate in their public school
 
03:01:55.150 --> 03:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
that includes being able to participate
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
in sports and being able to use the
 
03:01:59.429 --> 03:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
bathroom so we do not want to be forced
 
03:02:01.190 --> 03:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
to discriminate against any students
 
03:02:03.229 --> 03:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
which we feel we would have to if this
 
03:02:05.710 --> 03:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
bill passed my next point is if this
 
03:02:08.229 --> 03:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
bill passes how will it be enforced many
 
03:02:10.670 --> 03:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
of our schools have 300 500 even a
 
03:02:13.150 --> 03:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
thousand students in them not every
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
teacher knows every student so imagine
 
03:02:18.030 --> 03:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
this scenario as a staff person you're
 
03:02:20.190 --> 03:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
in the hallway during passing time you
 
03:02:21.950 --> 03:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
see a student going into the bathroom
 
03:02:24.429 --> 03:02:24.439 align:start position:0%
the student is dressed uh you know in a
 
03:02:26.550 --> 03:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
skirt and a and a blouse and looks like
 
03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
a girl okay do you have to question that
 
03:02:31.710 --> 03:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
that activity what if the student's uh
 
03:02:33.309 --> 03:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
appearance is more ambiguous like mine
 
03:02:35.750 --> 03:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
was in high school I was tall broad
 
03:02:37.630 --> 03:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
shouldered but developed late I wore
 
03:02:39.950 --> 03:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
jeans and a baggy shirt most days would
 
03:02:41.229 --> 03:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
you have to stop that student and
 
03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
question them how do we um enforce this
 
03:02:46.190 --> 03:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
do students have to carry their original
 
03:02:47.870 --> 03:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
birth certificate with them to prove whe
 
03:02:51.150 --> 03:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
whether their biological sex at Birth as
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
register on their birth certificate
 
03:02:54.550 --> 03:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
before they can go in the bathroom going
 
03:02:56.030 --> 03:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
to be an awfully long line and there's
 
03:02:57.950 --> 03:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
only a few minutes between classes we
 
03:02:59.510 --> 03:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to check each one or are you
 
03:03:01.030 --> 03:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting a different way of checking
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
do we have to question them and more
 
03:03:06.269 --> 03:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
carefully examine how they're dressed
 
03:03:08.309 --> 03:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
how they walk how they talk are we now
 
03:03:10.190 --> 03:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
doing gender profiling of students
 
03:03:11.790 --> 03:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
between classes before they can use the
 
03:03:15.429 --> 03:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
bathroom is anyone suggesting we do
 
03:03:18.030 --> 03:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
General Bill checks so we oppose this we
 
03:03:19.870 --> 03:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to be forced to harass our
 
03:03:22.550 --> 03:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
students thank you any
 
03:03:25.389 --> 03:03:25.399 align:start position:0%
questions representa
 
03:03:28.110 --> 03:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
cutell thank you Mr chair and um thank
 
03:03:29.510 --> 03:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it's nice to
 
03:03:31.110 --> 03:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
see you on a different committee yes
 
03:03:33.070 --> 03:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
good to see you again we haven't spoken
 
03:03:36.670 --> 03:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
in a while yes we haven't um my question
 
03:03:40.429 --> 03:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
is so if a girl on an athletic team
 
03:03:43.309 --> 03:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
feels um like she's being discriminated
 
03:03:46.349 --> 03:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
against because there's boys a boy a
 
03:03:48.349 --> 03:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
transgender girl
 
03:03:51.950 --> 03:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
playing on her athletic team would you
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
defend her in that situation if she felt
 
03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:56.990 align:start position:0%
defend her in that situation if she felt
discriminated

03:03:56.990 --> 03:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
discriminated
 
03:03:59.229 --> 03:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
against well your question is lar
 
03:04:00.429 --> 03:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
confusing because you couldn't even
 
03:04:02.229 --> 03:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
quite tell me who was uh on the team
 
03:04:05.309 --> 03:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
with her so um I'm going to let someone
 
03:04:07.150 --> 03:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
else answer that question thank you
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
because you've had a lot of testimony
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
about that already yep any other
 
03:04:14.469 --> 03:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
questions representative Horgan um yes
 
03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
in your experience um the schools when a
 
03:04:20.670 --> 03:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
child enrolls to the school do they even
 
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
does the school even know the child's
 
03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
entire medical history so isn't it
 
03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
possible that some uh
 
03:04:30.150 --> 03:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
trans trans girls or trans boys could
 
03:04:31.469 --> 03:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
enroll at the school without the
 
03:04:31.479 --> 03:04:32.870 align:start position:0%
enroll at the school without the
school's

03:04:32.870 --> 03:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
school's
 
03:04:35.790 --> 03:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge the medical history we have is
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
what the parent provides to us and it is
 
03:04:40.229 --> 03:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
usually very
 
03:04:44.590 --> 03:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
limited um it is usually related to you
 
03:04:46.349 --> 03:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
know like allergies things we would need
 
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
to know about things that might cause an
 
03:04:51.150 --> 03:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
emergency situation in the school um
 
03:04:54.070 --> 03:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
often a vaccine record so that we are
 
03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
aware of what communicable diseases they
 
03:05:02.190 --> 03:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
they might um you know be Pro might be
 
03:05:04.590 --> 03:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated against protected against um
 
03:05:08.269 --> 03:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
and if there is a need for the school
 
03:05:10.349 --> 03:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
nurse to know about a
 
03:05:12.550 --> 03:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
particular um issue that might come up
 
03:05:13.950 --> 03:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
at school so if you've got a medically
 
03:05:15.469 --> 03:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
fragile child we would have more
 
03:05:17.110 --> 03:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
extensive medical records but that child
 
03:05:20.229 --> 03:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
would most likely have an IEP or a 504
 
03:05:23.110 --> 03:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
plan so uh beyond that we don't keep a
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
lot of medical records at school because
 
03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's a privacy thing and you know
 
03:05:28.590 --> 03:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
asking for students to carry their
 
03:05:30.030 --> 03:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
original birth certificate around with
 
03:05:31.710 --> 03:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
them that sounds like a privacy thing to
 
03:05:31.720 --> 03:05:32.910 align:start position:0%
them that sounds like a privacy thing to
me

03:05:32.910 --> 03:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:05:36.429 --> 03:05:36.439 align:start position:0%
too yeah any other
 
03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions I heard it oh sorry that's
 
03:05:41.790 --> 03:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you
 
03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:59.790 --> 03:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
kellerer good afternoon uh Mr chairman
 
03:06:01.389 --> 03:06:01.399 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
record my name is Grace Murray and I'm
 
03:06:05.590 --> 03:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
from Amhurst New Hampshire I work as the
 
03:06:06.750 --> 03:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
political director for New Hampshire
 
03:06:10.229 --> 03:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
youth movement and I oppose HB
 
03:06:12.389 --> 03:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
148 while I have multiple issues with
 
03:06:14.110 --> 03:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm sure those have already
 
03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
been covered or will be covered by other
 
03:06:17.309 --> 03:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
testimonies today and I'm hoping to
 
03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
offer more of a different perspective um
 
03:06:22.110 --> 03:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
than has already been
 
03:06:24.349 --> 03:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
spoken this bill focuses on three
 
03:06:26.229 --> 03:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
situational classifications but I'll be
 
03:06:30.229 --> 03:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
just uh just addressing bathrooms um the
 
03:06:31.950 --> 03:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
text this Bell says that it aims to
 
03:06:33.870 --> 03:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
protect the Privacy rights and safety of
 
03:06:35.670 --> 03:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
citizens but a bill that opens the door
 
03:06:38.429 --> 03:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
to discrimination invasive questions and
 
03:06:40.229 --> 03:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
possibly dangerous assumptions does No
 
03:06:42.830 --> 03:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
Such Thing passing this bill would allow
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
an environment where instead of people
 
03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
just being able to use the restroom for
 
03:06:48.429 --> 03:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
its intended uses they would then have
 
03:06:50.110 --> 03:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
to worry about being accused of whether
 
03:06:51.870 --> 03:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
or not they
 
03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
belong I have polycystic ovarian
 
03:06:57.670 --> 03:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
syndrome PCOS for short a complex
 
03:06:59.429 --> 03:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
hormonal condition that affects around
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
one in 10 women in the
 
03:07:04.870 --> 03:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
US one of the many symptoms of PCOS is
 
03:07:08.670 --> 03:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
facial hair women will wax bleach pluck
 
03:07:10.510 --> 03:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
shave and do all other kinds of hair
 
03:07:11.910 --> 03:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
removal because frankly it can be
 
03:07:13.229 --> 03:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
embarrassing to have hair where you
 
03:07:15.910 --> 03:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't want it some women don't choose to
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
remove it though and maybe there are
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
maybe you're like in between Wax
 
03:07:22.349 --> 03:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
appointments what I'm trying to get at
 
03:07:25.030 --> 03:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
is that it's not uncommon to see by
 
03:07:27.469 --> 03:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
these standards a biological woman with
 
03:07:30.030 --> 03:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
facial hair what should these women do
 
03:07:31.389 --> 03:07:31.399 align:start position:0%
when they need to use the restroom
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
should they be sub subjected to the
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
scrutiny of others when they want to use
 
03:07:37.070 --> 03:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
a woman's restroom I shouldn't have to
 
03:07:39.469 --> 03:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
explain my medical history to to a
 
03:07:42.190 --> 03:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
stranger so I can use the restroom what
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
if they're not believed should that
 
03:07:44.990 --> 03:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
woman then use the men's restroom or
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
just hope she finds a gender neutral
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
bathroom how does that protect our
 
03:07:50.910 --> 03:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
privacy or our safety I'll tell you
 
03:07:52.389 --> 03:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
right now it really
 
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't if this bill passes that's
 
03:07:56.070 --> 03:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
exactly the kind of situation you'll be
 
03:07:58.710 --> 03:07:58.720 align:start position:0%

are they them and I'm going to be
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
speaking a little quickly I'm testifying
 
03:08:27.469 --> 03:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
against HB 148 today because we've heard
 
03:08:29.309 --> 03:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
some testimony of support today based
 
03:08:31.630 --> 03:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
not out of personal experience but fear
 
03:08:33.030 --> 03:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to speak on the violence
 
03:08:34.429 --> 03:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
this bill and its writer alleges to
 
03:08:35.950 --> 03:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
protect against by sharing a few of my
 
03:08:38.429 --> 03:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
personal experiences I'm concerned this
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill creates a precedent for policing
 
03:08:41.830 --> 03:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
bathrooms that results in justification
 
03:08:44.190 --> 03:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
of violence in the public culture the
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
first time I experienced physical
 
03:08:47.150 --> 03:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
violence because of the bathroom I was
 
03:08:48.830 --> 03:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
at a Walmart in North Carolina on
 
03:08:51.309 --> 03:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
hurricane disaster relief I was with two
 
03:08:53.389 --> 03:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
young 18-year-old gender non-conforming
 
03:08:55.389 --> 03:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
people who were on my Disaster Response
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
Team I was responsible for them a grown
 
03:08:58.870 --> 03:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
man stopped Us coming out of the
 
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
bathroom harassed us through screaming
 
03:09:02.469 --> 03:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
in the building staled us out of the
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
building and we were chased in the
 
03:09:05.910 --> 03:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
parking lot I was swung at by a grown
 
03:09:08.910 --> 03:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
man and hit and went to the ER because I
 
03:09:10.590 --> 03:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
was putting myself between the two young
 
03:09:13.349 --> 03:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
people I was responsible for ironically
 
03:09:14.750 --> 03:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
we were using a bathroom based on
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
assigned gender markers to try and avoid
 
03:09:18.030 --> 03:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
this aggression that certain kinds of
 
03:09:19.950 --> 03:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
states and regions are known for the
 
03:09:22.229 --> 03:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
kind of state ours could become this
 
03:09:23.910 --> 03:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
aggression can be a regular part of our
 
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
Lives as gender nonconforming people I
 
03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
was first sexually harassed at Broken
 
03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
Ground School in conquered in fourth
 
03:09:31.150 --> 03:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
grade when a male classmate slapped my
 
03:09:32.590 --> 03:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
butt and then grabbed my breast at 10
 
03:09:34.150 --> 03:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
years old I was assaulted in the
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
Christen mccul auditorium at conquered
 
03:09:38.269 --> 03:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
High School when a male Class C sorry
 
03:09:40.269 --> 03:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
classmate put his hand into my pants
 
03:09:42.389 --> 03:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
during a puppeted presentation relying
 
03:09:44.429 --> 03:09:44.439 align:start position:0%
on my embarrassment to not speak up I
 
03:09:47.389 --> 03:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
was date raped by an alleged friend male
 
03:09:49.269 --> 03:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
in a spiked beverage on a night I wasn't
 
03:09:51.309 --> 03:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
drinking violence is not coming from
 
03:09:53.510 --> 03:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
trans people and making them feel unsafe
 
03:09:54.870 --> 03:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
is not going to stop the sexual and
 
03:09:56.590 --> 03:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
physical assault perpetrated against
 
03:09:58.229 --> 03:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
women and children because trans people
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
are not the perpetrators they are also
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
the Survivors by passing this bill there
 
03:10:03.990 --> 03:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
are people who will assume you are
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
giving your permission for
 
03:10:07.110 --> 03:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination it is upholding patterns
 
03:10:08.710 --> 03:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
of violence perpetrated by bigots
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
against the trans Community if you
 
03:10:12.110 --> 03:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
support this bill you aren't protecting
 
03:10:13.550 --> 03:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
me you aren't protecting women or
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
children you aren't protecting the trans
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
Community you're inviting a societal
 
03:10:19.030 --> 03:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
standard of violence against us all
 
03:10:20.590 --> 03:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
please vote
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
itl and I'm happy to take any questions
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
any questions my backgrounds in Lakes so
 
03:10:29.790 --> 03:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
seeing n thank you thank you attorney
 
03:10:38.030 --> 03:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:40.229 --> 03:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
cabraal Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:10:42.150 --> 03:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
committee Ian hu appearing for
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone I will not try to cram any
 
03:10:46.590 --> 03:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
dense legal analysis into two minutes
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
but I will say I'd be happy to answer
 
03:10:51.550 --> 03:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
any legal questions and explain why this
 
03:10:54.510 --> 03:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
bill does not contradict title 7 or
 
03:10:58.030 --> 03:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
354a or discuss legal definitions of
 
03:11:00.830 --> 03:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
biological sex in the meantime I will
 
03:11:03.309 --> 03:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
just say I think most of the testimony
 
03:11:05.550 --> 03:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
I've heard in opposition to this bill
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
seems like testimony against a bill that
 
03:11:10.750 --> 03:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
would make being transgender illegal
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
actually of course this bill just says
 
03:11:15.510 --> 03:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
the biological sex exists and that the
 
03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
state may different iate based on
 
03:11:21.550 --> 03:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
biological sex sometimes that has been a
 
03:11:23.830 --> 03:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
feature of every historic legal system
 
03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
from Egypt to Japan since there have
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
been legal systems it happens every day
 
03:11:30.510 --> 03:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire when for example
 
03:11:33.030 --> 03:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
someone is arrested and I've heard
 
03:11:34.670 --> 03:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
virtually no one who speaking in
 
03:11:37.110 --> 03:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill explain why they
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
think biological sex does not exist or
 
03:11:40.990 --> 03:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
explain why the state should be
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited from ever differentiating
 
03:11:46.990 --> 03:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
based on biological sex thank you
 
03:11:50.630 --> 03:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
question questions representative
 
03:11:52.790 --> 03:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:11:57.950 --> 03:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
sir would you agree with the prime
 
03:12:00.389 --> 03:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor that if you want to just get
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
along you should pass this
 
03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
bill I think that this bill is a
 
03:12:07.349 --> 03:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
well-crafted compromise by
 
03:12:09.389 --> 03:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt and uh chief
 
03:12:10.710 --> 03:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
justice Lynn who contributed
 
03:12:13.590 --> 03:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
substantially to it in the last session
 
03:12:15.309 --> 03:12:15.319 align:start position:0%
and I think what you're getting at is
 
03:12:17.550 --> 03:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill allows locality by
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
locality School District by School
 
03:12:22.269 --> 03:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
District agency by agency decision
 
03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
making and so it would lead to people in
 
03:12:26.910 --> 03:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
different communities around the state
 
03:12:29.150 --> 03:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
enacting different policies as they best
 
03:12:31.070 --> 03:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
suit their
 
03:12:34.349 --> 03:12:34.359 align:start position:0%
communities any other
 
03:12:37.229 --> 03:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:12:39.710 --> 03:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
you cara
 
03:12:44.830 --> 03:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:46.710 --> 03:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
West thank you so much for the
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity need to speak my name is
 
03:12:50.710 --> 03:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
Cara cabal and I've been a resident of
 
03:12:52.990 --> 03:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for 36 years I live in
 
03:12:56.670 --> 03:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
Madbury I strongly urge you to oppose HB
 
03:12:59.190 --> 03:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
148 this bill will cause significant
 
03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
harm to transgender and gender
 
03:13:03.790 --> 03:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
non-conforming people broadly and to
 
03:13:06.429 --> 03:13:06.439 align:start position:0%
youth specifically it fails to address
 
03:13:08.550 --> 03:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
any real problems and instead creates
 
03:13:11.269 --> 03:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
new avenues for harm I've had the
 
03:13:13.510 --> 03:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
privilege of working with lgbtq plus
 
03:13:15.550 --> 03:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
youth for over a decade they're a
 
03:13:18.030 --> 03:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
delight they deserve better I've seen
 
03:13:20.269 --> 03:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
firsthand the challenges these young
 
03:13:22.670 --> 03:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
people face and the toll it takes when
 
03:13:24.670 --> 03:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
they aren't able to be who they truly
 
03:13:27.750 --> 03:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
are it erodes their confidence and their
 
03:13:29.910 --> 03:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
mental health and these challenges will
 
03:13:32.670 --> 03:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
only grow worse with policies like HB
 
03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
148 and I feel the weight of their fear
 
03:13:38.990 --> 03:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
in this current moment by advancing HB
 
03:13:41.429 --> 03:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
148 you are exacerbating the trauma they
 
03:13:43.510 --> 03:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
already experience from bullying
 
03:13:46.030 --> 03:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination and rejection depriving
 
03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
them of the opportunity to live
 
03:13:50.429 --> 03:13:50.439 align:start position:0%
authentically and reach their full
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
potential how can you advocate for
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
children's safety while supporting a
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
policy that risks exacerbating their
 
03:13:59.590 --> 03:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
suffering there's no credible evidence
 
03:14:01.750 --> 03:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
to suggest that classifying People based
 
03:14:05.070 --> 03:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
on biological sex and restrooms locker
 
03:14:07.150 --> 03:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
rooms or Sports improve safety or
 
03:14:09.830 --> 03:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
fairness it creates this bill creates a
 
03:14:12.670 --> 03:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
false Narrative of danger the ambiguity
 
03:14:14.110 --> 03:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
surrounding how the bill will be
 
03:14:17.469 --> 03:14:17.479 align:start position:0%
enforced will only lead to confus uson
 
03:14:19.870 --> 03:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination and increased violence I
 
03:14:23.070 --> 03:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
implore you to oppose HB 148 the harm it
 
03:14:25.229 --> 03:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
will cause cannot be understated thank
 
03:14:27.070 --> 03:14:27.080 align:start position:0%

03:14:50.469 --> 03:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
Pembrook and I'm here to oppose this
 
03:14:52.590 --> 03:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
bill unlike a lot of people who have
 
03:14:55.110 --> 03:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
spoken here today I I was not born here
 
03:14:57.550 --> 03:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
and I did not grow up in this state I
 
03:14:59.469 --> 03:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
grew up and started my transition in
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
Vermont and only moved here last year
 
03:15:04.389 --> 03:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
now you have heard a lot on how this
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
bill is harmful but i' would like to
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
speak as to why I moved to this state I
 
03:15:12.349 --> 03:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
moved here for greater opportunities and
 
03:15:14.790 --> 03:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
to build a life in the granite state in
 
03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
making this decision as an out
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
transgender woman a big part of the
 
03:15:21.269 --> 03:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
reason that I ultimately decided to move
 
03:15:23.030 --> 03:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
here after rigorous research and
 
03:15:25.309 --> 03:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
Analysis was the protections that the
 
03:15:28.070 --> 03:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
state has offered for people like me I
 
03:15:29.670 --> 03:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
moved here because I knew I would be
 
03:15:32.590 --> 03:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
safe in employment housing public life
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
and that I would have a bright future
 
03:15:37.070 --> 03:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
however with chilling effects of this
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the many like this I question
 
03:15:45.110 --> 03:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
my I question my future in this state
 
03:15:47.389 --> 03:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
how safe I will be and whether or not
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
this is really the best place for not
 
03:15:51.910 --> 03:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
only myself but for other trans people
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
like me with friends in other states how
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
do I ultimately choose to stay when my
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
ultimate when my future in this state is
 
03:16:02.030 --> 03:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
looking increasingly uncertain how do I
 
03:16:04.590 --> 03:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
tell my friends and queer other queer
 
03:16:06.870 --> 03:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
folks in less safe states that New
 
03:16:10.630 --> 03:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a sa safe state to move to
 
03:16:12.750 --> 03:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
how am I to really lay down roots in
 
03:16:15.550 --> 03:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
this state when it is increasingly when
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
it increasingly seems as though people
 
03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
like me are no longer welcome I urge you
 
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
to vote itl on HB
 
03:16:26.510 --> 03:16:26.520 align:start position:0%

I'm going to open up the hearing on
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 641 and recognize
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative Linda harth G gas right
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:17.950 --> 04:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
there you go good afternoon Mr chair and
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
and committee members I am
 
04:05:22.630 --> 04:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative Linda Harriet gathright
 
04:05:26.349 --> 04:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
out of Hillsboro 10 Nashville Awards
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
nine and I'm here to introduce my bill
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
establishing a private right of action
 
04:05:35.710 --> 04:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
for civil rights violations HB
 
04:05:38.670 --> 04:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
641 and in short I'm going to keep it
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
short because I have others that's
 
04:05:42.189 --> 04:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
coming behind me to
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
speak um in short it's asking that we
 
04:05:50.349 --> 04:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
allow a person to have the right to have
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
a lawyer to represent them for any civil
 
04:05:55.229 --> 04:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
rights violations they think might have
 
04:05:58.830 --> 04:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
been against them so with that
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
said I would recommend that you leave
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
your questions to those that come behind
 
04:06:06.070 --> 04:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
me there's quite a few
 
04:06:08.149 --> 04:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
speakers unless you have something
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
specific to me yes representative
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair thank
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
question um I'm under the impression
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
that somebody already has the right for
 
04:06:20.790 --> 04:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
a private right of action and violation
 
04:06:22.830 --> 04:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
of a discrimination under this chapter
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
under the Human Rights Commission you
 
04:06:26.910 --> 04:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely do but right now today you
 
04:06:29.870 --> 04:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
have to go through the AG's office so
 
04:06:32.670 --> 04:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
this will supplement that just to follow
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
up maybe the AG could probably help this
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
I believe the private right of I believe
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
an individual can file a case in the
 
04:06:44.349 --> 04:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
human rights division not not with the
 
04:06:46.030 --> 04:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
AG along with the AG but I believe an
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
individual themselves are able to do
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to say it's not quite
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
like that because I know others
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
individuals that took the case outside
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.469 --> 04:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any other
 
04:07:05.670 --> 04:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.189 --> 04:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
wheer thank you Mr chairman ranking
 
04:07:16.710 --> 04:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
member Smith friends on the house
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee I'm sure that
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative goth handled it well so
 
04:07:24.109 --> 04:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just here to affirm my support
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
there's a significant rise in these
 
04:07:29.790 --> 04:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
civil rights cases a 465 per rise in
 
04:07:31.389 --> 04:07:31.399 align:start position:0%
these civil rights cases according to
 
04:07:33.550 --> 04:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office and
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
allowing a private right of action for
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
these individuals to address those civil
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
rights cases I think is a very simple
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
common nonpartisan way to move forward
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
in this state so I'll let the good
 
04:07:49.389 --> 04:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
lawyers and people who have come here
 
04:07:52.109 --> 04:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
today with expert testimony
 
04:07:56.229 --> 04:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
testify more comprehensively to what is
 
04:07:57.870 --> 04:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
actually in the bill what's being passed
 
04:08:01.750 --> 04:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
around right now is an amendment to HB
 
04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
641 which would amend section three
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
section one by inserting and replacing
 
04:08:09.630 --> 04:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
the following as found in the bill for
 
04:08:12.670 --> 04:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
the third paragraph of section one um
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
would that Mr chair that's my testimony
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%

Department of Justice the department
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%

04:09:02.070 --> 04:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill representative Smith's
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
favorite comment I get to make um but we
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
do support the amendment we actually
 
04:09:07.870 --> 04:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
asked for this particular Amendment so
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
if you were to vote ought to pass we'd
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
ask that you ought to pass as amended um
 
04:09:14.309 --> 04:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
to the necessary though I do want to
 
04:09:15.990 --> 04:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
provide informational testimony about
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights Act the Civil Rights
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
unit the work that we do at the Attorney
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
General's office because the statute
 
04:09:23.550 --> 04:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
amends the Civil Rights Act I thought
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'd begin with a little background on
 
04:09:28.109 --> 04:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
that particular act and I'll touch on um
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's question as
 
04:09:31.950 --> 04:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
well U but the Civil Rights Act was
 
04:09:34.750 --> 04:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
passed in 1999 and it prohibits
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
interfering with rights and lawful
 
04:09:38.550 --> 04:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
activities of another through actual or
 
04:09:40.269 --> 04:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
threatened uses of force violence
 
04:09:42.910 --> 04:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
property damage or trespass when those
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
unlaw acts are motivated by protected
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
characteristics including race religion
 
04:09:50.229 --> 04:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
national origin disability gender
 
04:09:52.109 --> 04:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
identity sexual orientation and several
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
others it authorizes the Attorney
 
04:09:56.349 --> 04:09:56.359 align:start position:0%
General to bring actions to protect
 
04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
those rights we can seek the Attorney
 
04:10:00.269 --> 04:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
General's office can seek civil
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
penalties of up to $5,000 per violation
 
04:10:06.030 --> 04:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
a restraining order an injunction to
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
protect victims their communities and
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
further the goals of the Civil Rights
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%

04:10:13.870 --> 04:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
people's lawful activities
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
we can also if an order is put in place
 
04:10:17.950 --> 04:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
and later violated by the person who has
 
04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
the order against them pursue criminal
 
04:10:22.349 --> 04:10:22.359 align:start position:0%
charges if and when those orders are
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
violated the goal of the Civil Rights
 
04:10:27.309 --> 04:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
Act is to facilitate public protection
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
by creating an Avenue to use civil
 
04:10:31.710 --> 04:10:31.720 align:start position:0%

04:10:34.030 --> 04:10:34.040 align:start position:0%

scenarios where civil they may not have
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
access to those protections you know all
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
of these uses of force uses of violence
 
04:10:43.389 --> 04:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
property damage there may be Tor claims
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
that can be brought to seek remedies to
 
04:10:48.429 --> 04:10:48.439 align:start position:0%
seek damages for those but you can't
 
04:10:49.790 --> 04:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
where there are damages that could make
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
a person whole you wouldn't necessarily
 
04:10:53.349 --> 04:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
get the restraining order the injunctive
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
relief that the Civil Rights Act
 
04:10:57.109 --> 04:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
envisions and that's its primary
 
04:10:59.950 --> 04:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
function is to create a mechanism to
 
04:11:02.189 --> 04:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
protect rights going forward and to
 
04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
prevent future harm not just to redress
 
04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
what has happened in the past now in
 
04:11:11.109 --> 04:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
more recent history in December of 2017
 
04:11:12.910 --> 04:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
just about 7 years ago then Attorney
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
General McDonald created the Civil
 
04:11:16.349 --> 04:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
Rights unit to exercise The Authority
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
that had been vested in the Attorney
 
04:11:20.990 --> 04:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
General's office and in 2019 I came to
 
04:11:22.389 --> 04:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
lead that
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
unit and shortly after doing so we
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
issued protocols to all law enforcement
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state setting out what
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
we expect from them in terms of
 
04:11:32.830 --> 04:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
identifying not just Civil Rights Act
 
04:11:34.389 --> 04:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
violations but also potential hate
 
04:11:36.630 --> 04:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
crimes if and when they occur in those
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
communities as a result of that since
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter 2020 2021 because of
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um every officer that goes
 
04:11:46.149 --> 04:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
through the police academy receives a
 
04:11:48.030 --> 04:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
two-hour Block in training of training
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
in identifying hate crimes identifying
 
04:11:52.469 --> 04:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
potential identity bias or hate
 
04:11:55.590 --> 04:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
motivated Behavior to facilitate better
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
better kind of hate crime charges but
 
04:11:58.910 --> 04:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
also better more Civil Rights Act
 
04:11:58.920 --> 04:12:00.229 align:start position:0%
also better more Civil Rights Act
enforcement

04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
actions since then we've seen an
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
increase in complaints and referrals and
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
contacts with the public so and as of 24
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
2024 last year we received about 215
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
complaints whether they're from the
 
04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
public or referrals from law enforcement
 
04:12:16.790 --> 04:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
about a quarter to a third of those
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
complaints constitute what we would call
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
potential Civil Rights Act violations so
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's alleging or maybe alleging things
 
04:12:26.269 --> 04:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
that are violations of the
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
statute many of those cases some of many
 
04:12:30.189 --> 04:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
of those cases if they involve things
 
04:12:32.309 --> 04:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
like vandalism it may be difficult to
 
04:12:34.269 --> 04:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
identify suspects so not every single
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
complaint or referral we receive leads
 
04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
to an action because we need a defendant
 
04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
we need someone to charge with the
 
04:12:42.109 --> 04:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
violation um some of these cases involve
 
04:12:44.910 --> 04:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
juveniles and so those cases may be
 
04:12:46.830 --> 04:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
confidential and we can't discuss those
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
cases publicly but we you know we review
 
04:12:51.269 --> 04:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
them we screen them we work with law
 
04:12:52.990 --> 04:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement to further the investigation
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
to the extent we can to identify who if
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
and when to bring those cases
 
04:13:01.269 --> 04:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
forward with that increase in referrals
 
04:13:02.469 --> 04:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
and complaints we received we've been
 
04:13:04.030 --> 04:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
bringing more enforcement actions over
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
the years and we work closely with law
 
04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement to identify and and and
 
04:13:11.550 --> 04:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
establish when if and when violations
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
occur now looking at at this piece of
 
04:13:17.070 --> 04:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
legislation House Bill 641 although
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on the
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
underlying bill on creating that private
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
right of action we're glad to see that
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
the department we were glad to see in
 
04:13:25.389 --> 04:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
the original version of the bill that we
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
would receive notice when these
 
04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
complaints are filed by private citizens
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we know when these cases are
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
happening we know what those outcomes
 
04:13:32.990 --> 04:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
are because we would then be tasked with
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
if there are violations of any orders
 
04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
bringing the criminal
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
charges but we proposed the amendment to
 
04:13:41.189 --> 04:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
also allow the department to intervene
 
04:13:43.469 --> 04:13:43.479 align:start position:0%
in those cases so it's not if we see
 
04:13:45.389 --> 04:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
something that warrants greater
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
protection for the public than maybe
 
04:13:48.349 --> 04:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
what would be resolved between the
 
04:13:51.070 --> 04:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
private parties we can intervene and ask
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
for that relief we can make sure that
 
04:13:54.830 --> 04:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
the public at large is protected and not
 
04:13:57.870 --> 04:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
just the plaintiff in the case the same
 
04:13:59.550 --> 04:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
thing is true and that's kind of where
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
the concern and why we put forward that
 
04:14:03.790 --> 04:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment and ask the prime sponsor to
 
04:14:05.109 --> 04:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
bring that Amendment
 
04:14:07.109 --> 04:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
forward the last thing I want to touch
 
04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
on before I hit on some some questions
 
04:14:11.109 --> 04:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
here that had come up just considering
 
04:14:12.469 --> 04:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
the cost because there are fiscal there
 
04:14:14.990 --> 04:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
should be a f note with this um we do
 
04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
view it as at the very at best cost
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
neutral if you know or more likely it
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
would increase some of the demands and
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
resources placed on the department
 
04:14:23.670 --> 04:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
because we're going to be receiving
 
04:14:25.229 --> 04:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
additional complaints and cases that
 
04:14:26.790 --> 04:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
have been filed from sources outside of
 
04:14:28.830 --> 04:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
what we have been in the past so if
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
someone decides not to go to law
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement but to file an action we'll
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
get notice of that that we wouldn't have
 
04:14:35.349 --> 04:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
before and we'll have to screen that and
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it warrants
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
intervention so that you know we we do
 
04:14:41.950 --> 04:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
see that there may be increased work um
 
04:14:46.389 --> 04:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
that we're kind of happy to take on um a
 
04:14:48.870 --> 04:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
few notes Here I I I want to I did it
 
04:14:50.070 --> 04:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the Senate with the similar
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
version of this bill the 465 per
 
04:14:54.630 --> 04:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
increase that is total number of
 
04:14:57.109 --> 04:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
complaints and points of contact we have
 
04:14:58.189 --> 04:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
and the Civil Rights Union it's not
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily Civil Rights Act violations
 
04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
that have been alleged um I try to
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
clarify that every time I give numbers
 
04:15:07.469 --> 04:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
to the media and they don't put that
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
disclaimer on it they just report the
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers um but we certainly are
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
seeing an increase in hate motivated
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
behavior and Civil Rights Act violations
 
04:15:16.950 --> 04:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
I just don't have hard numbers for that
 
04:15:18.750 --> 04:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
um I also want to clarify we're not
 
04:15:20.590 --> 04:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed with the work that we have
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
we we are able to keep up with the Civil
 
04:15:24.349 --> 04:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
Rights Act violations that we receive
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
we're able to file those as they come in
 
04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
um and to the question about 354a versus
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
354b so three the private rights of
 
04:15:34.670 --> 04:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
action you're talking about with the
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights those fall
 
04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
out of RSA chapter 354a that's the
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
state's law against discrimination which
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
prohibits discrimination housing
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
employment public accommodations and
 
04:15:47.630 --> 04:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
public education yes private individuals
 
04:15:49.750 --> 04:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
have the right to file chart claims with
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission alleging
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
that 354b which this amends is the Civil
 
04:15:55.990 --> 04:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
Rights Act and only the attorney general
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
has the authority to bring actions under
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights Act there's no private
 
04:16:01.389 --> 04:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
right there might be again there's you
 
04:16:03.030 --> 04:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
know maybe underlying tort claims or
 
04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
things like that that someone could
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
bring and 354b addresses that it allows
 
04:16:09.469 --> 04:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
for individuals who may be we bring a
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
case they can still bring their own
 
04:16:12.590 --> 04:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
civil action to collect whatever damages
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
they might be entitled to so there's
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
still some Avenue but it doesn't have
 
04:16:19.229 --> 04:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
the kind of the the injunctive power
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
that comes with 354b if you're bringing
 
04:16:24.750 --> 04:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
a private torque claim um the only other
 
04:16:26.389 --> 04:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
thing I'll note and I I flagged this and
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
I think there'll be a couple other folks
 
04:16:29.189 --> 04:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
talking about it but I mentioned it to
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
the sponsor it's just there's some
 
04:16:33.070 --> 04:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
language in paragraph 2 around not
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily about the damages itself but
 
04:16:39.109 --> 04:16:39.119 align:start position:0%
I think it's lines 10 through 12 it
 
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
talks about methods of competition and
 
04:16:42.429 --> 04:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
Acts or practice that seem to be drawn
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
from the consumer protection act it just
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
might want to be cleaned up and
 
04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
clarified to make it fit this statute
 
04:16:50.109 --> 04:16:50.119 align:start position:0%
rather than think oh well it sounds like
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
OS just kind of pulled language out of
 
04:16:53.070 --> 04:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act and kind of
 
04:16:54.670 --> 04:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
plugged it in here so we just might want
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
to clean up that language a little bit
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
to make it fit the Civil Rights Act
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
rather than language referring to
 
04:17:04.229 --> 04:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
um unfair competition and deceptive
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
practices and with that I'm happy to
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
take any questions you all have
 
04:17:09.319 --> 04:17:11.349 align:start position:0%
take any questions you all have
representative

04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:17:16.149 --> 04:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question can you um
 
04:17:18.429 --> 04:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
provide and I you might have said it the
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
amount of complaints that were received
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
last year through your division of civil
 
04:17:24.030 --> 04:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
rights violations yep so um for the
 
04:17:25.389 --> 04:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
total number of complaints we received
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
there were 215 those alleging potential
 
04:17:29.950 --> 04:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Act violations and I'll say
 
04:17:31.269 --> 04:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
last year was the first time we started
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
segregating the numbers um was it was
 
04:17:36.189 --> 04:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
about I want to say it was about 50 to
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
55 that we received of that 215 50 to 55
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
were potential Civil Rights Act
 
04:17:45.149 --> 04:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
violations okay and if I could follow up
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
follow up um is there any um were there
 
04:17:52.830 --> 04:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
any complaints or potential violations
 
04:17:54.269 --> 04:17:54.279 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General's office did
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
not feel like they had adequate
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
resources to follow up with no CU we
 
04:18:00.550 --> 04:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
work a lot with local law enforcement
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
around investigating those complaints
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
and actions so we do pursue that we do
 
04:18:06.269 --> 04:18:06.279 align:start position:0%
have additional resources now we have an
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
investigator that's they split between
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
our unit and the election law unit so we
 
04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
have some support if we need further
 
04:18:13.469 --> 04:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
investigation that local law enforcement
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
can't do um so we have the resources to
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
follow up in that regard usually if
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
we're not taking an action it's either
 
04:18:22.109 --> 04:18:22.119 align:start position:0%
because a suspect hasn't been identified
 
04:18:24.510 --> 04:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
so we just don't have a person to charge
 
04:18:26.070 --> 04:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
or after we assess the complaint and the
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
evidence we determine and we'll let the
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
person know this that there is an action
 
04:18:32.550 --> 04:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we can pursue okay thank you any
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:40.149 --> 04:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much for being here
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
um just first a little CL clarification
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
you suggested that we should clean up
 
04:18:47.910 --> 04:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
the language does the Attorney General's
 
04:18:51.070 --> 04:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
office have a specific suggestion that
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
they could pass on to us of how they
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
think that that ambiguity would be I can
 
04:18:59.950 --> 04:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and do so I'll you
 
04:19:01.469 --> 04:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
know I haven't yet thought about it
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
because the damages piece is a little
 
04:19:04.309 --> 04:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
beyond our purview we wouldn't be
 
04:19:05.950 --> 04:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
getting damages but I can take a look at
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
that and see if there's anything oh that
 
04:19:10.349 --> 04:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
I hope that doesn't count as a question
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
no that was a a recommendation maybe
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so request thank you very
 
04:19:17.469 --> 04:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
much request maybe I I do have a
 
04:19:17.479 --> 04:19:19.189 align:start position:0%
much request maybe I I do have a
question

04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
I going back to the beginning you talked
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
about you said that um the the law
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement people have two hours of
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
training on hate
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
crimes um as you uh so clearly
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
stated the incidence of those crimes is
 
04:19:42.080 --> 04:19:43.189 align:start position:0%
stated the incidence of those crimes is
increasing

04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
04:19:45.870 --> 04:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
significantly do you believe that two
 
04:19:51.309 --> 04:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
hours of training is adequate to capture
 
04:19:51.319 --> 04:19:52.429 align:start position:0%
hours of training is adequate to capture
the

04:19:52.429 --> 04:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:55.269 --> 04:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
importance of that training for the work
 
04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement is expected to do
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
only because I do this I could probably
 
04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
spend entire days talking to law
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement about different aspects of
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
it but the point of the training block
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
for a new officer is just to give kind
 
04:20:08.910 --> 04:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
of it it I I often describe some of the
 
04:20:10.910 --> 04:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
sections when we talk about identifying
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
hate crimes as these are Flags like this
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
is when something should be kind of
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
going you should be hearing an alarm in
 
04:20:18.750 --> 04:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
the distance kind of in your mind that
 
04:20:20.389 --> 04:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
there's more to look at here and maybe
 
04:20:22.349 --> 04:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
contacting our office so we can assist
 
04:20:24.030 --> 04:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
them as they kind of conduct that
 
04:20:26.189 --> 04:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
investigation so it's not meant to be an
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing they will now know
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
everything to know it's about knowing
 
04:20:32.030 --> 04:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
when to ask for additional help or when
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
to look more deeply at a case than to
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
kind of Simply kind of brush off
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
something as potential coincidence or
 
04:20:39.630 --> 04:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
happen stance to know that there could
 
04:20:41.550 --> 04:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
be more there I mean there's you know
 
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
some of what we talk about talk about
 
04:20:44.670 --> 04:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
hate symbols and what to kind what
 
04:20:46.670 --> 04:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
common ones are you could do entire days
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
of training on different hate symbols
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
that exist so you know I think the point
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
is to ground them in um kind of what to
 
04:20:56.590 --> 04:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
look for and where there should be kind
 
04:20:58.269 --> 04:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
of like I said red flags for further
 
04:21:00.510 --> 04:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
followup well also as part of that
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
training um we have we go through a
 
04:21:04.389 --> 04:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
series of case studies where we take
 
04:21:06.189 --> 04:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
fact patterns and they take and they
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
apply some of the things they've learned
 
04:21:10.510 --> 04:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
about in the training to actual fact
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
pattern or to fact patterns so kind of
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
crafted from cases we may have brought
 
04:21:17.229 --> 04:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
or cases that maybe kind of people might
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
recognize but the idea is to Think
 
04:21:20.910 --> 04:21:20.920 align:start position:0%
Through what would happen What would I
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
ask for what evidence would I gather how
 
04:21:25.710 --> 04:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
do I further my suspicion of potential
 
04:21:28.269 --> 04:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
bias motivation and and so they can kind
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
of think in that moment because that's
 
04:21:33.070 --> 04:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be doing um out on
 
04:21:35.550 --> 04:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
patrol thank you is that is that
 
04:21:37.630 --> 04:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
training done yearly or is it a one-time
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
training it's um so for the police
 
04:21:41.710 --> 04:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
academy it's every police cadet so it's
 
04:21:43.070 --> 04:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think I actually do it six times a
 
04:21:45.070 --> 04:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
year but it's each class of police
 
04:21:46.990 --> 04:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
officers and then we have follow-up
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
training we've done some training for
 
04:21:51.109 --> 04:21:51.119 align:start position:0%
existing officers as well as prosecutors
 
04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
around identifying and Prosecuting hate
 
04:21:54.910 --> 04:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
crime offenses and what that might do in
 
04:21:56.830 --> 04:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
the criminal case if you were to charge
 
04:21:58.030 --> 04:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
something as a hate crime what you need
 
04:22:00.189 --> 04:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
to do as a result of that thank you
 
04:22:03.070 --> 04:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative tur yeah thanks um real
 
04:22:04.269 --> 04:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
real brief and thanks for taking the
 
04:22:05.830 --> 04:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
question real real briefly it may not be
 
04:22:08.030 --> 04:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
your area um if we're talking about
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
amending the language a little bit I
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
noticed in the analysis it mentions
 
04:22:14.830 --> 04:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
punitive damages uh by name and my
 
04:22:16.269 --> 04:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
understanding and if you could could
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
verify or not that our state doesn't
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
award punitive damages I'm not sure how
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
important it is that that gets that that
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
gets fixed but I think that language I
 
04:22:26.710 --> 04:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's not the way I read the bill itself
 
04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
but that that terminology seemed
 
04:22:31.229 --> 04:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
inconsistent for what I understood I I
 
04:22:33.790 --> 04:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
I'd share that I I would agree the state
 
04:22:35.109 --> 04:22:35.119 align:start position:0%
as a matter of the New Hampshire Court
 
04:22:36.830 --> 04:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't recognize punitive damages a lot
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
of times in statutes where there might
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
be what we would probably call punitive
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
damages it's enhanced compensatory
 
04:22:45.149 --> 04:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
damages um but I don't see the reference
 
04:22:46.750 --> 04:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
to it in the bill I just see it in that
 
04:22:48.990 --> 04:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
analysis piece so I'm not sure that
 
04:22:51.149 --> 04:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
that's what would that you would be able
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
to say these are punitive damages it
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
certainly sets a minimum damage
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
threshold um but I think um I it
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't reference punitive
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
damages here like I've seen in other
 
04:23:04.109 --> 04:23:04.119 align:start position:0%
statutes or other bills yeah thanks I I
 
04:23:05.790 --> 04:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what the the relevance of the
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
analysis after this moves on is I just
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
was Raising it as potential correction I
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
know when we when it goes into the rsas
 
04:23:15.309 --> 04:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
all that anal is gone so um it's just
 
04:23:16.830 --> 04:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
the it's just the changes listed out in
 
04:23:16.840 --> 04:23:18.030 align:start position:0%
the it's just the changes listed out in
the

04:23:18.030 --> 04:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:25.710 --> 04:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
ban thank you answering my question I
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know does this
 
04:23:30.990 --> 04:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
deal he hasn't answered it yet so hold
 
04:23:34.510 --> 04:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
on and ask he's giving you a hard time
 
04:23:36.429 --> 04:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
go ahead oh go
 
04:23:40.429 --> 04:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
ahead does this address students at all
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
or is it 18 above or what is it so
 
04:23:44.910 --> 04:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
anyone can be charged when this was a
 
04:23:46.750 --> 04:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
big point of debate actually in 1999
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
when the Civil Rights Act was passed
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
about whether juveniles could be covered
 
04:23:51.149 --> 04:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
under it juveniles can be and we've
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
brought actions I think internally we'd
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
be uncomfortable bringing actions
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
against someone under the age of 16
 
04:23:59.469 --> 04:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
probably but um we have brought actions
 
04:24:01.469 --> 04:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
against 16 and 17 year
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
olds um and and it involved incidents
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
that occurred in school um but in other
 
04:24:08.269 --> 04:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances particularly again with
 
04:24:10.149 --> 04:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
younger juveniles we leave that to the
 
04:24:12.750 --> 04:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system and um you like
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
families schools to address the behavior
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
at least in the Civil Rights Act there
 
04:24:17.790 --> 04:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
may be issues of discrimination law and
 
04:24:19.590 --> 04:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
public education that we'd get involved
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
in but that's a different Target when
 
04:24:23.550 --> 04:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking at those
 
04:24:26.670 --> 04:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
cases any other questions representative
 
04:24:30.590 --> 04:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thanks for taking my
 
04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
question what type of cases are you
 
04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
seeing it runs a range so we have cases
 
04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
from acts of violence we just Pro we
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
just actually received an order a few
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
weeks ago in a case where um it was
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
during a relationship had a romantic
 
04:24:50.149 --> 04:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
relationship had ended um the defendant
 
04:24:53.109 --> 04:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
in that case had kind of cornered the
 
04:24:54.750 --> 04:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
victim and convinced her to travel with
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
him she to try to escape disclosed that
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
she believed she was bisexual and he
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
began to savagely beat her he broke her
 
04:25:04.109 --> 04:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
eye orbital um he strangled her he bit
 
04:25:06.349 --> 04:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
her on the arm and he hit her with a bat
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
so we brought so we have cases from that
 
04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
to you know and those would be what I
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
call kind of I mean that's probably one
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the most egregious fact patterns
 
04:25:15.870 --> 04:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
we've had but we've had individuals one
 
04:25:17.790 --> 04:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
of the first cases I brought was an
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
individual who brandished a gas hose at
 
04:25:21.269 --> 04:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
a black family at a gas station in
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
Seabrook and threatened to douse them
 
04:25:25.349 --> 04:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
with gasoline and set them on fire um
 
04:25:27.870 --> 04:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
while shouting racial slurs at them so
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know there are some very outrageous
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
fact patterns that have come across my
 
04:25:34.469 --> 04:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
desk over the past several years many of
 
04:25:35.870 --> 04:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
our complaints though that we receive I
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
would say our vandalism it's a very
 
04:25:39.790 --> 04:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
common thing and a lot of times these
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
locations are chosen because of their
 
04:25:43.830 --> 04:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
remote nature so the lonia state school
 
04:25:45.870 --> 04:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
has been a target of vandalism multiple
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
times with
 
04:25:49.950 --> 04:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
swastikas um tags kind of supporting
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
neonnazi and white supremacist groups
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
tags calling out individual members of
 
04:25:55.309 --> 04:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
the Jewish community and threatening
 
04:25:58.030 --> 04:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
them with violence so um again it's it's
 
04:26:00.429 --> 04:26:00.439 align:start position:0%
it's a wide array of different things um
 
04:26:01.790 --> 04:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
but you know in know some of these
 
04:26:03.870 --> 04:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances people choose locations
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
especially for vandalism that are hard
 
04:26:06.990 --> 04:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
to you know there aren't cameras there
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
aren't you know contrary to what we all
 
04:26:09.870 --> 04:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
believe there are not cameras everywhere
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire recording
 
04:26:13.510 --> 04:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
all that we do um and so a lot of people
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
go undetected just the violence the
 
04:26:17.550 --> 04:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
suffering is what gets
 
04:26:21.309 --> 04:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
reported thank you any other questions
 
04:26:25.229 --> 04:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:36.189 --> 04:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:39.149 --> 04:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
Atkins good afternoon Mr chairman
 
04:26:41.469 --> 04:26:41.479 align:start position:0%

office I've been a member of the bar in
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since
 
04:26:52.269 --> 04:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
1989 in a volunteer capacity I'm the
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
legal redress chair for the greater NASA
 
04:26:59.469 --> 04:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
NAACP um I'm here to speak in support of
 
04:27:02.830 --> 04:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 641 on behalf of all of the
 
04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
branches of the NAACP in New Hampshire
 
04:27:07.590 --> 04:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
of which there is one in the greater
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
nsha Manchester Sea Coast and we have an
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
NAACP chapter College chapter at
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth for those that are not
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
familiar the NAACP is the oldest civil
 
04:27:21.790 --> 04:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
rights organization in the United States
 
04:27:22.910 --> 04:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
formed in
 
04:27:26.189 --> 04:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
1909 with a simple mission that includes
 
04:27:29.349 --> 04:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
protecting the civil rights of all
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
people the purpose of HB 641 as you've
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
heard is simply to provide a private
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
cause of action um for people who are
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
grieved and the victim of offenses
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
already prohibited by RSA
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
354b I think it's important to know that
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
all of our surrounding states that have
 
04:27:51.670 --> 04:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
similar statutes uh my understanding of
 
04:27:53.870 --> 04:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont Maine and Massachusetts provide
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
a private cause of action for its
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
citizens not only the Attorney General
 
04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
can uh bring a suit um attorney lock uh
 
04:28:07.630 --> 04:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
indicated that the amendment about
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
having the ability of the Attorney
 
04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
General to intervene uh um we have no
 
04:28:15.389 --> 04:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
problem with that we think that's a
 
04:28:18.229 --> 04:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
great idea we look to continuing to work
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office and
 
04:28:21.630 --> 04:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
the great work that they're doing in
 
04:28:25.309 --> 04:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
this regard because the simple facts are
 
04:28:28.149 --> 04:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
since 2017 the complaints being an
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
04:28:33.550 --> 04:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
465 in the state you asked about fact
 
04:28:36.750 --> 04:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
patterns this is not isolated it's not
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
in one Community it's from the madok
 
04:28:42.910 --> 04:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
region to the Lakes Region to Manchester
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
to nashwa to the Sea Coast and being a
 
04:28:48.950 --> 04:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
member of the bar for almost 36 years
 
04:28:52.630 --> 04:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
now I've never seen conduct like this in
 
04:28:55.309 --> 04:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
in the communities throughout our state
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
and if all of the complaints that are
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
made that attorney lock talked about to
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office think
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
about the number of complaints that
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
Susie Jones or Joe Smith whoever is the
 
04:29:09.710 --> 04:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
victim they're not calling the Attorney
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
General's office right so this is I
 
04:29:15.710 --> 04:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
think just a sample that's only the
 
04:29:17.389 --> 04:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
complaints that the Attorney General's
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
office um receives so again I ask uh uh
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
that this committee support this um and
 
04:29:30.870 --> 04:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith she stepped out um
 
04:29:33.189 --> 04:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
I will work with attorney lock to clean
 
04:29:34.790 --> 04:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
up some of the language that he
 
04:29:37.870 --> 04:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
suggested I think he uh hit it uh
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
correctly and I'm I'm happy to take any
 
04:29:43.030 --> 04:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
questions anyone may have representative
 
04:29:43.040 --> 04:29:44.990 align:start position:0%
questions anyone may have representative
uh

04:29:44.990 --> 04:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:48.910 --> 04:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
counselor for taking my
 
04:29:54.630 --> 04:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
question to put it
 
04:29:58.910 --> 04:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
simply um this is an ability
 
04:30:00.910 --> 04:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
irrespective irrespective of the
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office though they
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
can intervene irrespective of the
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office for an
 
04:30:11.550 --> 04:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
individual to bring a private suit uh
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
for civil rights
 
04:30:17.389 --> 04:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
violation so assuming that's what
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
happens my question has to do with an
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
attempted waiver of the right to damages
 
04:30:25.389 --> 04:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
uh shall be voided
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
unenforcable so I'm a plaintiff you're a
 
04:30:33.670 --> 04:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
defendant I sue you um under this
 
04:30:38.309 --> 04:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
statute and at some point we reach an
 
04:30:42.109 --> 04:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
agreement it can be uh before
 
04:30:44.229 --> 04:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
a court adjudication or perhaps even
 
04:30:47.309 --> 04:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
after adjudication and we may agree on
 
04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
an injunction we may agree on a number
 
04:30:54.149 --> 04:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:58.510 --> 04:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit me as the plaintiff from
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
waving uh I don't know it's called
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
statutory damages or whatever
 
04:31:07.550 --> 04:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
but any agreement that we make that
 
04:31:10.950 --> 04:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
waves the damage aspect would be void
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what the reason for that
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
is or if I just have it wrong sure the
 
04:31:17.229 --> 04:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is no it would
 
04:31:20.710 --> 04:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
not prevent or wave anyone's rights um
 
04:31:23.469 --> 04:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
in the hypothetically you provided there
 
04:31:25.630 --> 04:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
was a civil suit and again we're talking
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
civil actions here and someone um I'm
 
04:31:31.349 --> 04:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
the defendant you're the plaintiff and
 
04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're hypothetical um you bring an
 
04:31:37.349 --> 04:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
action and I agree to resolve the case
 
04:31:39.870 --> 04:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
with you I say yes I did it and I won't
 
04:31:43.550 --> 04:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
do it anymore and um we agree that there
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
won't be any damages that's fine that's
 
04:31:48.510 --> 04:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
not prohibited or we agree there would
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
be some that's fine not
 
04:31:56.109 --> 04:31:56.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited following up then what's the
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of this line in the
 
04:32:03.590 --> 04:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill yeah a couple things I think that
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
um RSA 358a the consumer protection act
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
uh was looked at as a model for this
 
04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
version and draft uh the bill that's
 
04:32:16.269 --> 04:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
submitted um and I think that situation
 
04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
would be in that same hypothetical you
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
and I had some relationship and you
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to enter agreement with me I was
 
04:32:23.760 --> 04:32:24.510 align:start position:0%
wanted to enter agreement with me I was
your

04:32:24.510 --> 04:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:32:27.870 --> 04:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
tenant okay and you wanted to enter an
 
04:32:30.309 --> 04:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
agreement with me that say hey here's
 
04:32:32.309 --> 04:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
the lease and by the way you can't ever
 
04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
say I violated your civil rights that
 
04:32:36.910 --> 04:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited you can't enter an
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
agreement and wave your fundamental
 
04:32:42.269 --> 04:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.109 --> 04:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any other
 
04:32:49.630 --> 04:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

2018 I appear here today as a private
 
04:33:31.990 --> 04:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
citizen to speak in support of HB 641 FN
 
04:33:33.510 --> 04:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
which would create a private right of
 
04:33:35.510 --> 04:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
action for any person aggrieved by a
 
04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
violation of New Hampshire's Civil
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
Rights Act HB 641 adds a necessary elent
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
that has been missing from our state
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
civil rights act the ability of an
 
04:33:48.990 --> 04:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
individual or business to speak for
 
04:33:51.310 --> 04:33:51.320 align:start position:0%

rights in
 
04:33:57.629 --> 04:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
court HB 641 is also a necessary coraly
 
04:33:59.470 --> 04:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
to the private right of action which has
 
04:34:01.629 --> 04:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
been available in the federal civil
 
04:34:06.310 --> 04:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
1871 I have the greatest respect and
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
admiration for the New Hampshire
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office which added a
 
04:34:15.470 --> 04:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
civil rights unit during my tenure as
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
chair of the Human Rights Commission and
 
04:34:19.590 --> 04:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
with whom I had a cordial and
 
04:34:21.709 --> 04:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
collaborative relationship during my
 
04:34:24.390 --> 04:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
time as chair nonetheless the State
 
04:34:27.310 --> 04:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office uh advocates
 
04:34:28.830 --> 04:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
for the best interest of the State of
 
04:34:31.470 --> 04:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and while those interests
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
May overlap and indeed often do overlap
 
04:34:37.150 --> 04:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
with individual interests in protecting
 
04:34:39.310 --> 04:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
their own civil rights the state has
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
limited human and financial resources
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
and cannot possibly give attention to
 
04:34:45.609 --> 04:34:45.619 align:start position:0%
every meritorious

04:34:49.470 --> 04:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
case that resource Gap is also true of
 
04:34:50.910 --> 04:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
Commission which does the best it can
 
04:34:55.269 --> 04:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
with limited resources but in answer to

representative
 
04:34:59.230 --> 04:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
Alexander's questions it's an agency of

Alexander's questions it's an agency of
limited

04:35:00.189 --> 04:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
limited
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction it only adjudicates cases
 
04:35:05.949 --> 04:35:05.959 align:start position:0%
involving discrimination and housing
 
04:35:08.189 --> 04:35:08.199 align:start position:0%

04:35:14.150 --> 04:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
education uh chapter 35 4 a is the is
 
04:35:16.990 --> 04:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission's enabling
 
04:35:20.390 --> 04:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
act uh this this uh bill would amend
 
04:35:23.470 --> 04:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
354b which sweeps much more
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
broadly the Human Rights Commission
 
04:35:30.990 --> 04:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
also um is unable to give Equitable
 
04:35:33.551 --> 04:35:33.561 align:start position:0%
relief uh the damages that it gives are
 
04:35:36.789 --> 04:35:36.799 align:start position:0%
limited to strictly compensatory
 
04:35:36.799 --> 04:35:39.310 align:start position:0%
limited to strictly compensatory
damages

04:35:39.310 --> 04:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
damages
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh the resource Gap at the Human
 
04:35:46.629 --> 04:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission is is clear in that in
 
04:35:49.029 --> 04:35:49.039 align:start position:0%
the fact that they have a a a statutory
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
time frame within which they're supposed
 
04:35:53.349 --> 04:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
to resolve their cases and for many
 
04:35:56.029 --> 04:35:56.039 align:start position:0%
years now they have far exceeded that
 
04:35:59.390 --> 04:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
statutory time frame uh it's it's a it's
 
04:36:01.230 --> 04:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
a great agency but unfortunately it's
 
04:36:02.910 --> 04:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
not an effective
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
agency uh for handling these kinds of
 
04:36:10.390 --> 04:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
cases uh HP 641 addresses these resource
 
04:36:12.990 --> 04:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
gaps by by empowering individuals and
 
04:36:15.310 --> 04:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
businesses to advocate for
 
04:36:18.590 --> 04:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
themselves to bring actions in their own
 
04:36:21.869 --> 04:36:21.879 align:start position:0%
names to assert their own rights to
 
04:36:23.310 --> 04:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
speak up for
 
04:36:25.470 --> 04:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
themselves and to have their day in
 
04:36:28.269 --> 04:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
court whenever they have suffered an an
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
injustice that rises to a violation of
 
04:36:30.840 --> 04:36:31.910 align:start position:0%
injustice that rises to a violation of
the

04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
law private rights of action already
 
04:36:37.629 --> 04:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
exist throughout New Hampshire law this
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
legislature over time has authorized
 
04:36:41.949 --> 04:36:41.959 align:start position:0%
private rights of action in the state's
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%

political advertising law and just last
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
year you enacted the uh law prohibiting
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
the use of deep fakes which has a
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
private right of action this list is not
 
04:37:01.830 --> 04:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
exhaustive but it gives you a sense of
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
the scope of the private rights of
 
04:37:05.230 --> 04:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
action that are already available to
 
04:37:06.910 --> 04:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
granted Staters in the
 
04:37:09.869 --> 04:37:09.879 align:start position:0%
law our state courts are by now well
 
04:37:11.551 --> 04:37:11.561 align:start position:0%
accustomed to handling these types of
 
04:37:14.189 --> 04:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
cases as part of their
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
dockets HB 641 FN authorizes individuals
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%
to take responsibility for themselves it
 
04:37:25.150 --> 04:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
is an act of individual empowerment at a
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
time when government is shrinking I urge
 
04:37:29.910 --> 04:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
you to give this power to the people of
 
04:37:34.029 --> 04:37:34.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and to approve HB 641
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
FN thank you I'm happy to take any
 
04:37:41.629 --> 04:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
questions any questions sentive Bur
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
a brief question that just occurred to
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
me perhaps might have gone better to
 
04:37:49.189 --> 04:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
attorney lock is part of your testimony
 
04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
has been
 
04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
that the private action contemplated by
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
this bill uh gives more powers of uh
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
of making things better than the current
 
04:38:08.551 --> 04:38:08.561 align:start position:0%
uh statute under which the AG's office
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
operates terms of injunctive or whatever
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
other kind we leave would it make sense
 
04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
uh at some point also to increase the
 
04:38:20.109 --> 04:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
power of the AG's office in terms of his
 
04:38:20.119 --> 04:38:23.070 align:start position:0%
power of the AG's office in terms of his
potential

04:38:23.070 --> 04:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.390 --> 04:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
remedies uh I I'm not going to speak to
 
04:38:28.470 --> 04:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
that I I'm attorney in private practice
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
I have uh an occasional case that goes
 
04:38:33.150 --> 04:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
up against the state of New Hampshire
 
04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
I'm not generally an advocate of
 
04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
increasing the power of the state um but
 
04:38:40.109 --> 04:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
I would leave that to Mr Lock to answer
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
that question better than I thank you
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:38:49.150 --> 04:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.029 --> 04:39:09.039 align:start position:0%
Katie good afternoon been a long time
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
since I've been here only three
 
04:39:14.629 --> 04:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
now exist that were here when I was
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
here so um you just pull that microphone
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit closer yeah it's good to
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
see so many people serving the
 
04:39:25.910 --> 04:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
public I come with only a couple of
 
04:39:29.109 --> 04:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
minutes one is this bill doesn't do
 
04:39:32.429 --> 04:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
something that for years I fought for
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
special education for my son who was a
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
high IQ and had a a
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
damage to the brain through a baseball
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
bat hitting his head and it caused an
 
04:39:49.270 --> 04:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
auditory sequential learning
 
04:39:51.868 --> 04:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
disability which caused him not to hear
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
all the
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
instructions my point being that from
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
first grade through sixth grade I went
 
04:40:03.868 --> 04:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
before hearing officer at the State
 
04:40:06.350 --> 04:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
Board of Education who found for me I
 
04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
went before complaints to the Department
 
04:40:12.750 --> 04:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
of Education who found down for
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
myself nothing
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
worked and what I feel is there are a
 
04:40:28.270 --> 04:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
couple of things that need to be added
 
04:40:31.070 --> 04:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
in the student handbook there should be
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
a section of
 
04:40:37.708 --> 04:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
501 uh C4 I'm I'm not quite Public Law
 
04:40:37.718 --> 04:40:39.150 align:start position:0%
501 uh C4 I'm I'm not quite Public Law
anyways

04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
Federal and so you should in amend this
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
to have a section in the student
 
04:40:47.070 --> 04:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
handbook I
 
04:40:49.590 --> 04:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
believe that tells the parents their
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
right for a handicapped
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
child I don't is this
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
the yeah this is Bill
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
641 that's what I've got I'm saying the
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:08.708 --> 04:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
addition the second thing is I
 
04:41:12.590 --> 04:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
believe that if there were fine
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
for violations
 
04:41:20.510 --> 04:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
of children's rights under handicapped
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
education we would have
 
04:41:27.150 --> 04:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
accountability there are no
 
04:41:31.830 --> 04:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
fines that you have I had to go
 
04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
to the New England Department of
 
04:41:37.628 --> 04:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
Education with my complaint
 
04:41:40.470 --> 04:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
before the school district was punished
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
by making them put out a pamphlet for
 
04:41:48.030 --> 04:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
every child in the school to take home
 
04:41:52.270 --> 04:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:56.190 --> 04:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
rights and the further things that they
 
04:41:58.830 --> 04:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
did at the
 
04:42:02.310 --> 04:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
school but this bill doesn't
 
04:42:02.320 --> 04:42:03.868 align:start position:0%
school but this bill doesn't
do

04:42:03.868 --> 04:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
enough I support it but I think you need
 
04:42:07.760 --> 04:42:09.390 align:start position:0%
enough I support it but I think you need
to

04:42:09.390 --> 04:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
have a section to
 
04:42:18.070 --> 04:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
501c4 and if you had for everybody in
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
the school the right to a pamphlet
 
04:42:28.150 --> 04:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
telling them their rights under handicap
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
education it would very
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
nicely give the parent the idea of what
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
they could expect for their
 
04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
trial thank you any questions
 
04:42:46.590 --> 04:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:05.230 --> 04:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:08.788 --> 04:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
elely hello and thank you for hearing me
 
04:43:08.798 --> 04:43:09.788 align:start position:0%
elely hello and thank you for hearing me
and

04:43:09.788 --> 04:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm Ray elely from
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
Lichfield and uh I do SE while I
 
04:43:19.550 --> 04:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
celebrate the fact that we do have an
 
04:43:22.510 --> 04:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general and they do seem to be
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
trying that's a good thing so but I do
 
04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
know that these things are under
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
reported I know of one myself just
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
recently where a lot of stuff happened
 
04:43:37.868 --> 04:43:37.878 align:start position:0%
but nothing was written down and there's
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
no record of it at
 
04:43:43.788 --> 04:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
all so we do need a greater mechanism
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
even though I'm not accusing anybody but
 
04:43:47.948 --> 04:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
I think the way the thing is done now
 
04:43:50.310 --> 04:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
even though we are in good faith trying
 
04:43:53.430 --> 04:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
to fix things I think that it uh
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
violates the 14th Amendment a little bit
 
04:43:59.070 --> 04:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
the uh first section where it says no
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
State shall make or enforce any law
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
which shall abridge the Privileges or
 
04:44:06.270 --> 04:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
immunities of citizens of the United
 
04:44:09.270 --> 04:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
States and I think it may be an undue
 
04:44:13.230 --> 04:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
burden to have people have to go through
 
04:44:16.350 --> 04:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General when people that
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
are not minorities they would consider
 
04:44:22.628 --> 04:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
absurd to have to go to the attorney
 
04:44:24.670 --> 04:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
general if they
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
were attacked coerced beaten tortured
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
threatened they would consider it absurd
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
to have to go to the attorney
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
general they would want that settle on
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
its own and I think this is a a good
 
04:44:41.868 --> 04:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
move forward I I think we've done what
 
04:44:44.590 --> 04:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
we could in the past and that was good
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
but I think we have to move forward and
 
04:44:48.990 --> 04:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
I think if we don't do that what we're
 
04:44:51.990 --> 04:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
doing is we're encouraging lawlessness
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
because of human nature if there's no
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
law if there's no punishment I'm going
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
to do more and if we look at the way
 
04:45:01.070 --> 04:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
things are going right now people are
 
04:45:03.070 --> 04:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
just seeing how much they can get away
 
04:45:05.948 --> 04:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
with and so I think we need things in
 
04:45:08.430 --> 04:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
place to say as a matter of fact
 
04:45:10.750 --> 04:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
whatever we can do to make it better so
 
04:45:12.910 --> 04:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
people people don't just ignore laws
 
04:45:14.990 --> 04:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
because it comes down to that age-old
 
04:45:17.948 --> 04:45:17.958 align:start position:0%
thing of the war on the weak people
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
think it's a war on brown and black
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
people or other minorities but it's
 
04:45:26.350 --> 04:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
always been a war on the week and WW2
 
04:45:28.628 --> 04:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
and should have taught us that sooner or
 
04:45:31.628 --> 04:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
later it may start out with the Jews but
 
04:45:34.510 --> 04:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
it gets around to everybody including
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
the French the Italian the Polish
 
04:45:39.230 --> 04:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
Romanians and everybody else including
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
Germans so if we stop it at the
 
04:45:44.590 --> 04:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
beginning it won't get to
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
us and that's my
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
comments thank you representative
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman is your
 
04:45:56.110 --> 04:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
testimony relevant to HB
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
641 this this wasn't to me 641 because
 
04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
we have a requirement that minorities
 
04:46:06.590 --> 04:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
have to go through the Attorney General
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
in order to get some sort of recompense
 
04:46:11.788 --> 04:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
that's a a burden to them whereas if
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
they could just file something
 
04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
themselves and they should have the
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
rights of we should be moving so that
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
they have rights like everybody else so
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm here to support this
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill any other
 
04:46:28.590 --> 04:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:30.670 --> 04:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
okay is there anyone else that wishes a
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
speak on house bills
 
04:46:35.628 --> 04:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
641 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
641 and I'm going to open the hearing on
 
04:46:42.788 --> 04:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:49.150 --> 04:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
right and representative are you ready
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
do you have your witness you do okay
 
04:46:54.750 --> 04:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize uh representative papichi
 
04:47:19.150 --> 04:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:20.910 --> 04:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
if it's okay I just want to wait a few
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:17.430 --> 04:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
ready thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:48:19.150 --> 04:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
distinguished members of the committee I
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to introduce
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
this bill for the record my name is
 
04:48:25.670 --> 04:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
Daniel popovic mu I represent wiam
 
04:48:29.548 --> 04:48:29.558 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 17 and um this is a
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill that intends to protect
 
04:48:36.190 --> 04:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
free speech in the uh in the during the
 
04:48:38.350 --> 04:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
exercise of religious
 
04:48:42.670 --> 04:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
beliefs to introduce the reason for it
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
at this point in time this right is
 
04:48:46.830 --> 04:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
federally protected through the
 
04:48:48.788 --> 04:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
religious freedom restoration act which
 
04:48:51.990 --> 04:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
was passed in 1993 almost unanimously by
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
the Congress and Senate federally signed
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
in by President Clinton at a later point
 
04:48:59.590 --> 04:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court correctly ruled that
 
04:49:01.270 --> 04:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
the compelling interest test that this
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
Federal legislation provides cannot be
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
enforced on the states unless they adopt
 
04:49:09.070 --> 04:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
it themselves in New Hampshire we do
 
04:49:11.470 --> 04:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
have a 2020 Supreme cour Court decision
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
in the state versus MAC that does that
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
that basically says that the compelling
 
04:49:18.110 --> 04:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
interest test has to be used to burden
 
04:49:18.120 --> 04:49:19.270 align:start position:0%
interest test has to be used to burden
religious

04:49:19.270 --> 04:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
religious
 
04:49:22.350 --> 04:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
exercise but I've never found it to be
 
04:49:25.270 --> 04:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
good practice to rely on uh Court
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
precedence when legislation would do a
 
04:49:31.390 --> 04:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
better job so the intent of HB 620 is to
 
04:49:33.670 --> 04:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
code those protections the appropriate
 
04:49:35.948 --> 04:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
level of protections into state law so
 
04:49:38.350 --> 04:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't have to worry about the
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court potentially reversing
 
04:49:40.200 --> 04:49:41.350 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court potentially reversing
itself

04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:49:43.990 --> 04:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's actually a very short piece of
 
04:49:46.670 --> 04:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
legislation I usually skip prefatory
 
04:49:48.190 --> 04:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
Clauses but I felt that in this
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
particular case it was valuable to
 
04:49:52.590 --> 04:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
briefly explain what the intent is it
 
04:49:54.910 --> 04:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
may make it easier for courts to later
 
04:49:56.830 --> 04:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
understand exactly the intent of the
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
language and really the entire meat of
 
04:50:01.510 --> 04:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is on the bottom of page one
 
04:50:05.150 --> 04:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
and the top of page two which says that
 
04:50:07.708 --> 04:50:07.718 align:start position:0%
we have to use a compelling government
 
04:50:09.548 --> 04:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
interest test and only the least
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
restrictive means
 
04:50:13.150 --> 04:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
of furthering the compelling govern
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
governmental interest should be
 
04:50:19.548 --> 04:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
used remedies are very basic and the
 
04:50:21.990 --> 04:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
last part of the bill the construction
 
04:50:23.430 --> 04:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
Clause is
 
04:50:26.190 --> 04:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
really technically not needed because it
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
basically repeats what the
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
federal Clause says and we cannot really
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
overcome the supremacy clause makes them
 
04:50:35.788 --> 04:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
theirs Prevail over hours but the intent
 
04:50:37.590 --> 04:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
of putting it into the state legislation
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
is to clearly signal that we are not
 
04:50:42.270 --> 04:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
trying to you know interfere with it in
 
04:50:43.750 --> 04:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
any way
 
04:50:48.150 --> 04:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
so this type of legislation has been
 
04:50:51.150 --> 04:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
um adopted by a majority of the US
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
states quite a few other states that
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
have not adopted it are relying on their
 
04:50:58.510 --> 04:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court existing decisions to not
 
04:51:01.350 --> 04:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
adopt it but typically when it's passed
 
04:51:02.708 --> 04:51:02.718 align:start position:0%
it tends to be passed with broad
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisan margins because everybody
 
04:51:07.390 --> 04:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
agrees that you know it's a
 
04:51:09.070 --> 04:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional right that needs to be
 
04:51:11.390 --> 04:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
protected so I'm going to try to keep
 
04:51:13.868 --> 04:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
this short and U I'll be happy to answer
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
any questions of course any
 
04:51:19.868 --> 04:51:19.878 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you oh
 
04:51:19.878 --> 04:51:21.470 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you oh
representative

04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
Smith you're hiding behind
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
Joe well I'm always proud to be sitting
 
04:51:27.718 --> 04:51:28.990 align:start position:0%
Joe well I'm always proud to be sitting
behind

04:51:28.990 --> 04:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
behind
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
Joe um thank you uh for being here um
 
04:51:39.628 --> 04:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
can you uh relate the impact or import
 
04:51:41.230 --> 04:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
might be a better word
 
04:51:43.948 --> 04:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
of the proposed 620
 
04:51:48.150 --> 04:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
FN on the use of
 
04:51:51.868 --> 04:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
um uh public
 
04:51:54.830 --> 04:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
money um
 
04:51:58.510 --> 04:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh in uh religious
 
04:52:01.708 --> 04:52:01.718 align:start position:0%
education I in my understanding of the
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
two areas of the laws I do not think
 
04:52:07.868 --> 04:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
this has any practical impact on that
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
because again under
 
04:52:13.548 --> 04:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
State versus MAC we already have that
 
04:52:15.390 --> 04:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
decision by the Supreme Court so this
 
04:52:18.670 --> 04:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
will not change the current practices it
 
04:52:20.910 --> 04:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
will just enshrine the current state of
 
04:52:24.670 --> 04:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
affairs into the you know state law
 
04:52:28.030 --> 04:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
and I I genuinely don't see this as
 
04:52:30.948 --> 04:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
impacting that directly because I don't
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
think we are sending you know State
 
04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
money directly to any uh you know
 
04:52:37.708 --> 04:52:37.718 align:start position:0%
religious organizations that would
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
create a legal issue here
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
representative Povich Müller uh I have
 
04:52:50.670 --> 04:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
been looking at some of the online
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
testimony uh around this bill and I see
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
for example that we have testimony from
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
the American atheists organization in
 
04:53:01.868 --> 04:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
opposition to HP 620 they assert that it
 
04:53:03.788 --> 04:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
would somehow interfere with the
 
04:53:05.990 --> 04:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of uh New
 
04:53:08.830 --> 04:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens um I I think they
 
04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
might have say Granite State as they say
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rights my question is
 
04:53:15.110 --> 04:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
this can you see any possible
 
04:53:17.670 --> 04:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this bill and of the
 
04:53:19.948 --> 04:53:19.958 align:start position:0%
effect that it would produce which would
 
04:53:22.548 --> 04:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
infringe upon anyone's constitutional
 
04:53:26.590 --> 04:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
rights no I don't and frankly anybody
 
04:53:28.548 --> 04:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
asserting that discretes constitutional
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
obligations must have not read the
 
04:53:33.788 --> 04:53:33.798 align:start position:0%
Constitutions correctly because both the
 
04:53:35.310 --> 04:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution and the state
 
04:53:36.990 --> 04:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
constitution clearly establish the
 
04:53:39.390 --> 04:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
rights that this is protecting we are
 
04:53:40.750 --> 04:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
just talking about a specific specific
 
04:53:43.708 --> 04:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
judicial standard that has to be applied
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
which again has been established as the
 
04:53:47.910 --> 04:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
correct one at every level of courts in
 
04:53:50.430 --> 04:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
this country so I genuinely am a bit
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
confused as to what their concern is but
 
04:53:57.990 --> 04:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh my cell phone is 6032 67 4142 if they
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
want to reach out to me I'll be happy to
 
04:54:01.590 --> 04:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
address any concerns they may have thank
 
04:54:05.470 --> 04:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions seeing
 
04:54:10.910 --> 04:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.270 --> 04:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
is it Lance
 
04:54:22.990 --> 04:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:26.590 --> 04:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
yes provided a fairly large packet of
 
04:54:27.788 --> 04:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
information maybe more than the
 
04:54:29.548 --> 04:54:29.558 align:start position:0%
committee will have time to to look at
 
04:54:32.430 --> 04:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
but my name is Lance kinzer um I
 
04:54:34.350 --> 04:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
represent a group called First Amendment
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
partnership and uh my background with
 
04:54:39.628 --> 04:54:39.638 align:start position:0%
riff roads that I had the opportunity
 
04:54:41.470 --> 04:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
for six years to chair the house
 
04:54:42.910 --> 04:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee in the state of
 
04:54:46.990 --> 04:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
Kansas when we passed a rifra in 2013
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a story I'll get to in a
 
04:54:50.948 --> 04:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
moment as to why we in particular Pastor
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
riffer in Kansas that I think is helpful
 
04:54:55.788 --> 04:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
uh in understanding just how important
 
04:54:57.788 --> 04:54:57.798 align:start position:0%
having Clarity with respect to the
 
04:55:00.430 --> 04:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
standard of review in religious liberty
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
cases can be in fact in the Kansas
 
04:55:04.750 --> 04:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
instance it was a matter of life and
 
04:55:06.548 --> 04:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
death for one Jehovah's Witness woman
 
04:55:08.030 --> 04:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll get back I'll come to that at
 
04:55:10.590 --> 04:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
the conclusion of my remarks the the
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative already did a good job of
 
04:55:15.270 --> 04:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
expressing the fact that uh unlike many
 
04:55:17.470 --> 04:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
states the courts in New Hampshire have
 
04:55:19.990 --> 04:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
been quite solicitous of protecting
 
04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
religious liberty under the New
 
04:55:23.708 --> 04:55:23.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution and there's 2020
 
04:55:25.990 --> 04:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
case state vmac in which the New
 
04:55:28.470 --> 04:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court was clear that
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
as they currently interpret the
 
04:55:32.670 --> 04:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
constitution of state of Massachusetts
 
04:55:34.470 --> 04:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny the compelling State
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
interest test applies in cases where
 
04:55:41.070 --> 04:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
there's a viol where there's a there's a
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
government action that substantially
 
04:55:45.390 --> 04:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
burdens a sincerely held religious
 
04:55:48.350 --> 04:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
belief and the way that your court
 
04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
articulated that standard was that the
 
04:55:53.070 --> 04:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
government must show a compelling State
 
04:55:55.470 --> 04:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
interest and they must show that the
 
04:55:57.430 --> 04:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
that the bill has been narrowly tailored
 
04:55:59.708 --> 04:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
in order to achieve that interest what
 
04:56:03.190 --> 04:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the bill is very similar
 
04:56:05.708 --> 04:56:05.718 align:start position:0%
language but with a slightly but with
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
slightly different verbage and I want to
 
04:56:09.310 --> 04:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
draw the committee's attention to that
 
04:56:11.470 --> 04:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
because I think it is important uh to
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
recognize we're not trying to shift
 
04:56:14.788 --> 04:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
anything here the least restrictive
 
04:56:17.470 --> 04:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
means test and the narrow tailoring test
 
04:56:18.830 --> 04:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
generally speaking are going to be
 
04:56:21.310 --> 04:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
interpreted the same way in fact if at
 
04:56:23.070 --> 04:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
some point the committee wanted to use
 
04:56:25.070 --> 04:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
the Mac language and talk about narrow
 
04:56:26.590 --> 04:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
tailoring instead of lease restrictive
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
means I don't think it would change it
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at the Mac opinion you'll
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
see that they actually site they
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
actually use least restrictive means
 
04:56:37.270 --> 04:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
language as well in that opinion citing
 
04:56:40.310 --> 04:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
favorably to another case and so my
 
04:56:41.788 --> 04:56:41.798 align:start position:0%
point is to say those standards are the
 
04:56:43.510 --> 04:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
same the representative already
 
04:56:46.230 --> 04:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that if you look at the bill
 
04:56:48.350 --> 04:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
um towards the end there's a provision
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
that talks about construction and that
 
04:56:54.910 --> 04:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
is when this was drafted the intent was
 
04:56:57.190 --> 04:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
to try to make it look as close as
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
possible to the federal riff so that
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
there wasn't any kind of sense that we
 
04:57:04.190 --> 04:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
were trying to hide the ball and act a
 
04:57:06.070 --> 04:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
super rifra at a bunch of additional
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
protections a lot of States like
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
sticking very closely to the federal
 
04:57:11.750 --> 04:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
language because there's 30 plus years
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
of stable precedent around how that's
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
been interpreted um but as the
 
04:57:18.390 --> 04:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative noted that construction
 
04:57:20.150 --> 04:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
clause which basically talks about the
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
fact that nothing in the bill can impact
 
04:57:24.788 --> 04:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
the interpretation of The Establishment
 
04:57:27.788 --> 04:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
Clause um in some ways is superflous
 
04:57:29.470 --> 04:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
because of course nothing a state
 
04:57:31.788 --> 04:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
legislature can do can impact the way
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
courts interpret a con a federal
 
04:57:37.590 --> 04:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision so with all of
 
04:57:40.270 --> 04:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
that said um let me return to the the
 
04:57:43.150 --> 04:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
Kansas story and why I think Clarity on
 
04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
this issue is so so important and why
 
04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
having it in statute like 20 other eight
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
other states have done is important even
 
04:57:53.868 --> 04:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
when you have pretty good case law in
 
04:57:58.230 --> 04:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
Kansas we had pretty clear case law um
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
up through the early 90s uh that strict
 
04:58:02.830 --> 04:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
scrutiny was the Constitutional standard
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
under our state Bill of Rights we then
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
had some dicta in a late 90s case that
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
created some confusion as to what
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
whether perhaps at least in some cases
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
the Smith rational basis test applied
 
04:58:17.350 --> 04:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
and to step back I'm presuming a lot of
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
Baseline knowledge here but the reality
 
04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
is that for
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
Generations um under the First Amendment
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution any time where there
 
04:58:27.510 --> 04:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
was a substantial burden on religious
 
04:58:30.030 --> 04:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
liberty the court would ask is there a
 
04:58:31.708 --> 04:58:31.718 align:start position:0%
compelling governmental interest for
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
this action and has the government used
 
04:58:35.708 --> 04:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive means to achieve
 
04:58:37.948 --> 04:58:37.958 align:start position:0%
it if so even though there's a burden on
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
religious liberty the law stays in place
 
04:58:42.350 --> 04:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
however um if those if those factors
 
04:58:45.390 --> 04:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
aren't met uh then you don't get um you
 
04:58:48.150 --> 04:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
don't get then you if those factors
 
04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
aren't met then the state action is is
 
04:58:53.670 --> 04:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
invalid and the plain if can Prevail so
 
04:58:56.430 --> 04:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
in 1990 an Employment Division V Smith
 
04:58:59.868 --> 04:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
for a wide array of um cases under
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
federal law the standard of proof was
 
04:59:05.190 --> 04:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
shifted to rational basis essentially if
 
04:59:07.390 --> 04:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's a if you get the rational basis
 
04:59:09.070 --> 04:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
test you're almost always going to lose
 
04:59:11.150 --> 04:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
I think any litigator would uh would
 
04:59:13.948 --> 04:59:13.958 align:start position:0%
tell you that and so Congress uh passed
 
04:59:15.548 --> 04:59:15.558 align:start position:0%
the religious freedom restoration act in
 
04:59:18.510 --> 04:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
'93 signed by by President Clinton and
 
04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
since then 28 states have passed their
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
own State rias making it clear that they
 
04:59:25.868 --> 04:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
want the strict scrutiny standard now
 
04:59:27.750 --> 04:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
what happened in Kansas going back to my
 
04:59:30.150 --> 04:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
story we had a lack of clarity we had
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat confusing case law we didn't
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
have a state rifra and we had a
 
04:59:38.910 --> 04:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
Jehovah's Witness woman who needed a a
 
04:59:40.868 --> 04:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
she was a Medicaid recipient needed an
 
04:59:44.510 --> 04:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
organ transplant and she was asking for
 
04:59:46.548 --> 04:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
a religious waiver so she could go out
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
of state to have that procedure take
 
04:59:51.430 --> 04:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
place in a way that comported with her
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
sincerely held religious beliefs around
 
04:59:56.948 --> 04:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
blood transfusions there was a Medicaid
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
waiver board in Kansas promulgating our
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
state our State Medicaid RS and they
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
said no you don't get the waiver now
 
05:00:07.070 --> 05:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
that was absurd there were all sorts of
 
05:00:08.670 --> 05:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
things in the process that were broken
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
but Mary Stein Mets went through an
 
05:00:13.190 --> 05:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing a district court
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and a Kan and and took her case
 
05:00:17.628 --> 05:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
ultimately to the Kansas court of
 
05:00:20.628 --> 05:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
appeals all because there was confusion
 
05:00:22.510 --> 05:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
as to whether she got rational basis
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
review or strict scrutiny review and
 
05:00:30.030 --> 05:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately um she won her case they said
 
05:00:31.628 --> 05:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
that you should have been granted this
 
05:00:34.230 --> 05:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh this waiver but by the time she had
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
finished doing all of that litigation
 
05:00:38.670 --> 05:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
her situ her condition had so
 
05:00:40.670 --> 05:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
deteriorated that she was no longer
 
05:00:43.230 --> 05:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
eligible for the transplant list so in
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
2012 Mary Stein Mets died in the United
 
05:00:48.948 --> 05:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
States of America for her sincerely held
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
religious belief and so the reason I'm
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
here all the way from Kansas despite
 
05:00:55.070 --> 05:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
canceled flights a whole A real plane
 
05:00:57.390 --> 05:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
trains and automobile story I could tell
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
about getting here just a couple minutes
 
05:01:02.430 --> 05:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
before the hearing started um is because
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
I want to as much as I can I feel like
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
we in Kansas passing our riffer in 2013
 
05:01:11.670 --> 05:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
a year after Mary Stein Mets died um
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
failed her and I want to communicate to
 
05:01:17.390 --> 05:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
other states that just clarifying you're
 
05:01:19.948 --> 05:01:19.958 align:start position:0%
already existing standard uh that your
 
05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
courts have adopted would be a wise
 
05:01:25.310 --> 05:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
thing to do a prudent thing to do and
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately will is a good thing for the
 
05:01:29.788 --> 05:01:29.798 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire so I
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the committee's Indulgence in
 
05:01:32.750 --> 05:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
letting me speak for so long and I'd be
 
05:01:35.628 --> 05:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions
 
05:01:38.590 --> 05:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:01:41.948 --> 05:01:41.958 align:start position:0%
Burch thank thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:01:45.628 --> 05:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
for taking my will be in artfully
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
phrased questions and uh the compliment
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
that we're all as deeply versed in this
 
05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
as you are because we're not um I
 
05:01:56.910 --> 05:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
noticed in the bill the site to the
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
Flores case and perhaps you and I can
 
05:02:04.230 --> 05:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
agree or can we agree that it's really
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
the Smith case that we're talking about
 
05:02:09.390 --> 05:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the New Hampshire
 
05:02:13.110 --> 05:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um said that the New
 
05:02:16.190 --> 05:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution provides more
 
05:02:18.510 --> 05:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
protections than the Smith case am I
 
05:02:21.030 --> 05:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
correct so the Smith case is the the the
 
05:02:23.390 --> 05:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
generating cause of of why we're here
 
05:02:26.430 --> 05:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
today that's true the Flores case when
 
05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
when riff was Tim initially passed at
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
the federal level the intent of Congress
 
05:02:33.190 --> 05:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
was to have it apply to the states and
 
05:02:34.788 --> 05:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
there was a little window in there from
 
05:02:38.590 --> 05:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
93 to 97 where that was kind of the
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
understanding but that was test Ed in
 
05:02:42.990 --> 05:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
this Flores case and the US Supreme
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
Court in a win for federalism said
 
05:02:47.788 --> 05:02:47.798 align:start position:0%
Congress lacked the authority to impose
 
05:02:50.510 --> 05:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
that on the states and so um you you got
 
05:02:52.230 --> 05:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of you got a few states in the
 
05:02:57.110 --> 05:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
90s right after um Employment Division V
 
05:02:59.548 --> 05:02:59.558 align:start position:0%
Smith that that passed statutes and then
 
05:03:00.868 --> 05:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
you get a pause because everybody
 
05:03:02.830 --> 05:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
thought oh we don't even need it because
 
05:03:04.548 --> 05:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
we have the federal riff and then a
 
05:03:07.150 --> 05:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
bunch of States pass it post Flores
 
05:03:08.948 --> 05:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
because it's clear the federal riffer is
 
05:03:12.910 --> 05:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
not going to apply it state law followup
 
05:03:17.590 --> 05:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so we have what is it the Mac
 
05:03:23.390 --> 05:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
State ma H the peyot case and um I'm
 
05:03:26.310 --> 05:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
wondering other than hey it's nice to
 
05:03:26.320 --> 05:03:27.510 align:start position:0%
wondering other than hey it's nice to
pass

05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislation um is there any value added
 
05:03:34.150 --> 05:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
legislation to what the the New
 
05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has already
 
05:03:44.430 --> 05:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
said that article one part five yeah uh
 
05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
provides what's the value added if
 
05:03:48.548 --> 05:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
anything yeah so as someone who works on
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
religious liberty issues across the
 
05:03:53.948 --> 05:03:53.958 align:start position:0%
country um Mac is a great opinion and
 
05:03:56.510 --> 05:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
your current interpretation of your
 
05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
state constitution applying strict
 
05:03:59.520 --> 05:04:01.628 align:start position:0%
state constitution applying strict
scrutiny

05:04:01.628 --> 05:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
scrutiny
 
05:04:04.590 --> 05:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
is there put it this way a number of
 
05:04:07.510 --> 05:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
states even states that have passed
 
05:04:09.910 --> 05:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
riffer relatively recently for example
 
05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
Montana have done so despite the despite
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
or maybe in some ways even inspired by
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
or by the fact that they know that we've
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
got a long history of
 
05:04:27.070 --> 05:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
interpreting our constitutional
 
05:04:28.910 --> 05:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions in a way that's solicitous of
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
religious liberty and we want to make
 
05:04:34.628 --> 05:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
sure that we lock that in as a statutory
 
05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
matter so that there changes in the
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
composition of the courts um that that
 
05:04:42.510 --> 05:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
standard is here and so in this instance
 
05:04:44.110 --> 05:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
in some states where it's less clear
 
05:04:45.990 --> 05:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire I can I can see
 
05:04:47.310 --> 05:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
somebody saying the need is more
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
pressing but my view is that having
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
Clarity on this issue by a reinforcing
 
05:04:57.070 --> 05:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
statute is prudentially wise for states
 
05:04:59.868 --> 05:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
to do because you don't know um how the
 
05:05:01.390 --> 05:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
composition of the Court might change or
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
how might you might get a different
 
05:05:04.990 --> 05:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
opinion in the future you know people
 
05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
the feds didn't realize until the Smith
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
case happened that they needed a riffa
 
05:05:09.440 --> 05:05:10.230 align:start position:0%
case happened that they needed a riffa
so

05:05:10.230 --> 05:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
I just one follow up onee yeah quickly
 
05:05:13.440 --> 05:05:15.628 align:start position:0%
I just one follow up onee yeah quickly
go

05:05:15.628 --> 05:05:15.638 align:start position:0%
go
 
05:05:20.110 --> 05:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
yeah but what I hear from you is that
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
life doesn't change if we pass this
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow for the next day and the next
 
05:05:24.240 --> 05:05:25.750 align:start position:0%
tomorrow for the next day and the next
day

05:05:25.750 --> 05:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
but you suggest that the protection of a
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
statute might protect against the future
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court my question
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
is if a future New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:05:41.948 --> 05:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
Court thinks uh Max wrongly decided the
 
05:05:44.470 --> 05:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
fact that we have a statute won't make
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
okay this is a great question because it
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
leads to an issue that sometimes is a
 
05:05:49.510 --> 05:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
confusing the legislature can't just
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
like Congress couldn't tell the US
 
05:05:55.948 --> 05:05:55.958 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court the New Hampshire
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
legislature can't tell the state supreme
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
court how to
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
interpret the Constitution that's the
 
05:06:04.990 --> 05:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
perview of the court but what the what A
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
legislature can do what the federal
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
riffer did and what this bill would do
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
is it can create an independent
 
05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
statutory protection that is parallel to
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
or in some instances like at the federal
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
level broader so this wouldn't change
 
05:06:21.628 --> 05:06:21.638 align:start position:0%
and it wouldn't direct the the courts of
 
05:06:23.190 --> 05:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court to
 
05:06:25.390 --> 05:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
interpret the Constitution any
 
05:06:26.990 --> 05:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
differently than it does now because
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's their prerogative but it would
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
say that you could as a New Hampshire
 
05:06:33.230 --> 05:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
citizen bring both a claim under the
 
05:06:35.470 --> 05:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
State Constitution and you could bring
 
05:06:37.510 --> 05:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
your statutory claim which is an
 
05:06:40.390 --> 05:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
independent right and so um it's
 
05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
different in that sense that you would
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
have both of those claims and if you
 
05:06:46.628 --> 05:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
know for years and years we could have
 
05:06:48.150 --> 05:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
been sitting in you know in Congress in
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
' 89 and somebody could have said we
 
05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
have sherbet V verer why do we need this
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
you know this riffer bill um to protect
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
our rights and I think the person
 
05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
sitting there would have said what I
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
said we we don't know when we may get a
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
contrary opinion and having an
 
05:07:04.868 --> 05:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
independent statutory right protects our
 
05:07:07.628 --> 05:07:07.638 align:start position:0%
citizens against that eventuality so it
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
it but it conceptually it is a a
 
05:07:11.910 --> 05:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
statutory right not a constitutional
 
05:07:14.070 --> 05:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
right to preserve the separation of
 
05:07:16.390 --> 05:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
powers thank you representative
 
05:07:19.070 --> 05:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for traveling here and and uh
 
05:07:22.990 --> 05:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
offering us this testimony
 
05:07:26.910 --> 05:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
today as I consider this
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
bill one of the the elements that I see
 
05:07:31.948 --> 05:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:07:35.310 --> 05:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
religion uh is not explicitly defined by
 
05:07:37.990 --> 05:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
the new language in the bill although it
 
05:07:40.230 --> 05:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
does make reference to
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire state constitution
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
part one articles four and five which of
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
course include uh language uh talking
 
05:07:51.270 --> 05:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
about one's right to worship God in the
 
05:07:53.430 --> 05:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
manner and season most agreeable to the
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
dictates of One's Own conscience and so
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
forth if I
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
know that there are uh a good number of
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
people and organizations in our society
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
today who act in the manner of a
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
religion with regard to uh topics like
 
05:08:14.670 --> 05:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
Dei and climate
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
change and if I know that the federal
 
05:08:21.548 --> 05:08:21.558 align:start position:0%
refer act also does not define
 
05:08:24.868 --> 05:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
religion can you articulate what you
 
05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
perceive should be interpreted If This
 
05:08:30.868 --> 05:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
Were passed as a religious belief and
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
how you might view certain other beliefs
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
as being other than religious beliefs so
 
05:08:38.910 --> 05:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
that's a a great question and it's not
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
an easy one in some ways and one of the
 
05:08:43.868 --> 05:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
reasons that the bill doesn't attempt a
 
05:08:46.150 --> 05:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
statutory definition of religion and
 
05:08:49.230 --> 05:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
instead defaults to the way in which the
 
05:08:51.310 --> 05:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
term religion has been interpreted in
 
05:08:56.708 --> 05:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional documents is because um
 
05:09:00.390 --> 05:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
any any attempt to Define religion in a
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
a Webster's Dictionary kind of way in a
 
05:09:06.670 --> 05:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
statute runs the risk of either being
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
overly or underly inclusive and so
 
05:09:14.030 --> 05:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
the the ability to look at the facts and
 
05:09:16.868 --> 05:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
circumstances of a given case to
 
05:09:19.788 --> 05:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
determine whether based upon all the the
 
05:09:21.310 --> 05:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
background and case law that there is
 
05:09:22.788 --> 05:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
around this question of what is a
 
05:09:24.910 --> 05:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
religion whether it applies we just
 
05:09:27.030 --> 05:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
think that caseby casee determination is
 
05:09:28.750 --> 05:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
the better way to go as opposed to
 
05:09:31.990 --> 05:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
trying to Define it in the statute what
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
I will say is this that courts have been
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
very leery uh to question a religious
 
05:09:41.310 --> 05:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
belief based upon the fact of you know
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
do we agree with it do we disagree with
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
it is it rational is it irrational but
 
05:09:48.788 --> 05:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
what courts will evaluate often times is
 
05:09:49.788 --> 05:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
is this
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
belief sincerely held is it sincerely
 
05:09:54.990 --> 05:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
religious and so courts actually are
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
quite good um at and I think New
 
05:10:00.708 --> 05:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts would be as well they
 
05:10:03.868 --> 05:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
at faring out kind of pretext religion
 
05:10:07.390 --> 05:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
claims and so religion typically is more
 
05:10:09.990 --> 05:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
than a mere philosophical belief
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and and but um I I guess I'll just
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
leave it there to say no State Rios
 
05:10:18.240 --> 05:10:20.548 align:start position:0%
leave it there to say no State Rios
attempt

05:10:20.548 --> 05:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
a blackl definition of religion because
 
05:10:28.030 --> 05:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
it really has to be determined based
 
05:10:30.628 --> 05:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
upon the facts and circumstances of a
 
05:10:30.638 --> 05:10:31.990 align:start position:0%
upon the facts and circumstances of a
given

05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
given
 
05:10:33.670 --> 05:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
individual thank
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
05:10:38.190 --> 05:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:10:42.670 --> 05:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:42.680 --> 05:10:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
Peter

05:10:47.670 --> 05:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:50.110 --> 05:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
Chamberlain thank you so much I'm Peter
 
05:10:51.868 --> 05:10:51.878 align:start position:0%
Chamberlain I Pastor the granite state
 
05:10:54.430 --> 05:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
Baptist Church right here in conquer and
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm not here as a lawyer to be able
 
05:10:59.948 --> 05:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
to defend those those are interesting
 
05:11:01.910 --> 05:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions which we could answer from our
 
05:11:05.230 --> 05:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
perspective on uh religion but we're
 
05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
asking in support of this bill simply
 
05:11:10.470 --> 05:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
because we know that the Constitution
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
does give freedom of
 
05:11:16.990 --> 05:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
religion but to have this clarified that
 
05:11:19.270 --> 05:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
any laws or anything that is imposed
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
upon any church synagogue or religious
 
05:11:25.948 --> 05:11:25.958 align:start position:0%
gathering um not just be a blanket
 
05:11:28.190 --> 05:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
statement this does not just give us
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
cart Blan to do whatever we would like
 
05:11:33.230 --> 05:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
to do but actually have this defined
 
05:11:35.830 --> 05:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
that if a law is going to be imposed or
 
05:11:40.270 --> 05:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions upon a church or assembly
 
05:11:43.430 --> 05:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
that yes it is proven this is in the
 
05:11:45.430 --> 05:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
best interest and then okay we have the
 
05:11:48.548 --> 05:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
defense is what you're requiring
 
05:11:52.910 --> 05:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
actually the most um minimal invasive
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
way to be able to apply that and so to
 
05:11:57.990 --> 05:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
be able to separate that now to go back
 
05:12:00.910 --> 05:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
to one question on making this statutory
 
05:12:02.750 --> 05:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
instead of Precedence when it comes from
 
05:12:04.548 --> 05:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court and basing it upon
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
their judgment I do go back to the
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
scriptures and uh the book of Exodus
 
05:12:12.070 --> 05:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
reminds us that uh there was a pharaoh
 
05:12:13.750 --> 05:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
there was a king that arose that knew
 
05:12:13.760 --> 05:12:14.590 align:start position:0%
there was a king that arose that knew
not

05:12:14.590 --> 05:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
Joseph and everything changed from the
 
05:12:19.310 --> 05:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
previous generation because it was
 
05:12:21.628 --> 05:12:21.638 align:start position:0%
subjective and now they interpreted
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
things completely different and so when
 
05:12:28.750 --> 05:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
we are in a society that a law can be
 
05:12:31.150 --> 05:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
subjective that it can change
 
05:12:32.910 --> 05:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation we would rather have
 
05:12:35.390 --> 05:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
something codified in law that clearly
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
defines uh exactly what the parameters
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
are and not B in it upon just the
 
05:12:42.670 --> 05:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to go back and
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
reinterpret what a precedent would be or
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
something that was put forth and so to
 
05:12:51.548 --> 05:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
help clarify in your mind about religion
 
05:12:53.190 --> 05:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
and this is from our perspective when we
 
05:12:56.190 --> 05:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
do go to scripture uh James does the
 
05:12:58.430 --> 05:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
Book of James does Define that very well
 
05:13:00.990 --> 05:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
pure religion and undefiled before God
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
is to visit the fatherless and the
 
05:13:05.390 --> 05:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
widows and to keep himself unspotted
 
05:13:08.070 --> 05:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
from the world now in Christianity when
 
05:13:10.590 --> 05:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
we hold to the scripture ures uh we
 
05:13:13.030 --> 05:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
believe that that also not more than
 
05:13:16.150 --> 05:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
just a philosophical belief but actually
 
05:13:18.270 --> 05:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
having actions behind that so I believe
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
it would have to be a sincere belief
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
that causes actions and has an outflow
 
05:13:25.070 --> 05:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
not just hold up in a room somewhere
 
05:13:26.750 --> 05:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
saying I believe this therefore give me
 
05:13:28.910 --> 05:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
all the benefits and so there has to be
 
05:13:31.230 --> 05:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
a sincerely held belief and also an
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
outward acting on those beliefs to be
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
able to make a difference in those that
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
are around so that's why we as a church
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
I have uh two other pastors were not
 
05:13:43.070 --> 05:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
able to be here and so combined we would
 
05:13:45.510 --> 05:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
be representing just in our three
 
05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
between four and 500 people that we
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
could March through asking for this to
 
05:13:52.110 --> 05:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
be codified and support the bill and uh
 
05:13:54.310 --> 05:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
several others you say why is a man come
 
05:13:57.030 --> 05:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
from Kansas to be able to help he is
 
05:14:00.430 --> 05:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
here with us we are in um Fellowship
 
05:14:03.788 --> 05:14:03.798 align:start position:0%
over this and uh to be able to discern
 
05:14:05.590 --> 05:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more so from our
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
perspective as a pastor and our church
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
we are asking for support of the bill to
 
05:14:12.470 --> 05:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
be able to codify this just Define it
 
05:14:15.030 --> 05:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
and will it change anything tomorrow no
 
05:14:17.350 --> 05:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
but it may help things not to change for
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
our next Generation that's coming and uh
 
05:14:21.628 --> 05:14:21.638 align:start position:0%
to be able to protect that and that's
 
05:14:23.310 --> 05:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
what we're after so thank you very much
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
for the time if there are any questions
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
from a pastor's perspective I'll be
 
05:14:28.990 --> 05:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them for you any
 
05:14:32.750 --> 05:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
05:14:41.910 --> 05:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:44.110 --> 05:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Timothy Shaler
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney here in Conquer New
 
05:14:48.110 --> 05:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire live in Lowden have four kids
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
I've had the privilege of studying
 
05:14:50.708 --> 05:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional law extensively in law
 
05:14:52.430 --> 05:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
school and in continued education
 
05:14:54.430 --> 05:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
programs as a lawyer and one thing I've
 
05:14:56.510 --> 05:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
seen is that many times people that are
 
05:14:57.868 --> 05:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs or defendant in these
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
cases are law-abiding citizens who
 
05:15:02.708 --> 05:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
suddenly get a spot of conflict between
 
05:15:04.390 --> 05:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
the the government and the religion and
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
they're trying to reconcile it so on a
 
05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
practical level how do we help those
 
05:15:10.110 --> 05:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
people resolve those problems and how do
 
05:15:11.990 --> 05:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
we do it efficiently you know if someone
 
05:15:13.990 --> 05:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
calls me as an attorney and asks me
 
05:15:15.670 --> 05:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
about constitutional law how do you
 
05:15:17.708 --> 05:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
interpret that what might they do let's
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
read through this big MA case let's try
 
05:15:21.510 --> 05:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
to guess it gets pretty complicated and
 
05:15:22.830 --> 05:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
that makes it more expensive and that's
 
05:15:25.350 --> 05:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
a barrier to resolving these things
 
05:15:27.150 --> 05:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
efficiently so I think if we have a
 
05:15:29.670 --> 05:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
statute that lays something out clearly
 
05:15:30.910 --> 05:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
that someone's in this troubled
 
05:15:32.510 --> 05:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
situation can open the statute said
 
05:15:34.830 --> 05:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
here's the law it's clear they can go
 
05:15:36.830 --> 05:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
through a process to solve it it can
 
05:15:38.390 --> 05:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
help us to get through those difficult
 
05:15:38.400 --> 05:15:39.670 align:start position:0%
help us to get through those difficult
situations

05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
situations
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
and as a society I think we do want to
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
accommodate people who may see things
 
05:15:45.390 --> 05:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
different than us I think that's a a
 
05:15:47.788 --> 05:15:47.798 align:start position:0%
strength of our society that diversity
 
05:15:49.708 --> 05:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
there's also Val have a process to do
 
05:15:52.150 --> 05:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
that because ideals are just ideals

um my name is Sarah Burke Cohen I
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:16:39.270 --> 05:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
Association um the New Hampshire
 
05:16:41.830 --> 05:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association sorry if I'm not
 
05:16:43.708 --> 05:16:43.718 align:start position:0%
talking to that straightly uh opposes
 
05:16:47.670 --> 05:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
this bill uh we feel that this bill has
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
several issues that could present
 
05:16:52.548 --> 05:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
themselves um part of those issues um
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
were uh brought forward in actually the
 
05:16:57.990 --> 05:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
city of War versus flues where um a
 
05:17:01.548 --> 05:17:01.558 align:start position:0%
church was attempting to was in a
 
05:17:04.270 --> 05:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
historic district and looking to um get
 
05:17:06.270 --> 05:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
an extension onto it and was denied that
 
05:17:07.708 --> 05:17:07.718 align:start position:0%
permit and went up to the Supreme Court
 
05:17:11.230 --> 05:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
as we know um um and the federal rifra
 
05:17:14.190 --> 05:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
was um found to be unconstitutional as
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
it applied to states that the the
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution didn't reach to
 
05:17:20.150 --> 05:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
States um the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:17:22.470 --> 05:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
association's biggest concern is that
 
05:17:26.030 --> 05:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
similar to um what has happened in uh
 
05:17:28.788 --> 05:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
the city of Bourne uh that uh religious
 
05:17:31.788 --> 05:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
institutions could use um the compelling
 
05:17:35.948 --> 05:17:35.958 align:start position:0%
uh interest um test to expand and use
 
05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
that so that they would um be able to
 
05:17:40.830 --> 05:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh make a claim that they wouldn't have
 
05:17:45.030 --> 05:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
to uh follow uh normally neutral uh laws
 
05:17:48.990 --> 05:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
such as um zoning or uh similar
 
05:17:52.190 --> 05:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
ordinances although there although there
 
05:17:54.430 --> 05:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
is is the state court uh the Supreme
 
05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
Court test uh that has been put forward
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
we think that uh having it in the
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
statute uh would again open up for
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
possible abuse for for these neutral um
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
tests it also uh could uh cause
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination as you know against
 
05:18:12.750 --> 05:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
marginalized people we also have some
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
some um you know unintended consequences
 
05:18:17.708 --> 05:18:17.718 align:start position:0%
I think um representative McFarland
 
05:18:19.350 --> 05:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
asked about the definition of religious
 
05:18:21.910 --> 05:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
or religious beliefs that is not settled
 
05:18:24.750 --> 05:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
this could uh create um complex
 
05:18:27.628 --> 05:18:27.638 align:start position:0%
litigation that involves um this statute
 
05:18:29.708 --> 05:18:29.718 align:start position:0%
including trying to Define what a
 
05:18:33.070 --> 05:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
religious or religious belief is um it
 
05:18:35.868 --> 05:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
also could include complex litigation
 
05:18:37.590 --> 05:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
relative to what is a compelling
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
interest what is Al tailored means these
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
as uh the attorney that uh just
 
05:18:45.310 --> 05:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
testified can be costly and would be
 
05:18:47.628 --> 05:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
costly for municipalities who are
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
attempting to enforce their uh local
 
05:18:53.670 --> 05:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances or otherwise uh
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
neutral neutrally applicable laws um
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
with that are there any questions for me
 
05:19:01.440 --> 05:19:02.750 align:start position:0%
with that are there any questions for me
representative

05:19:02.750 --> 05:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
mcfallen thank you Mr chairman I I just
 
05:19:07.270 --> 05:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
had a question on your commentary there
 
05:19:11.628 --> 05:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
about the perspective uh potential for
 
05:19:14.470 --> 05:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
emerging legislation along the lines of
 
05:19:16.830 --> 05:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
the question I had asked earlier and I'm
 
05:19:19.548 --> 05:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
I must admit perplexed by your comments
 
05:19:22.270 --> 05:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
in light of the fact that we have had
 
05:19:24.150 --> 05:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
the the current language in our state
 
05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
constitution for quite a long time and I
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't recall any such legislation
 
05:19:30.390 --> 05:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can expand upon why you
 
05:19:32.470 --> 05:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
think this would suddenly precipitate
 
05:19:35.430 --> 05:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about this legislation
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
that there is potential for if suits
 
05:19:41.070 --> 05:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
were brought claims were made under this
 
05:19:43.470 --> 05:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
this specific legislation that it could
 
05:19:46.708 --> 05:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
create complex legis uh complex suits
 
05:19:49.270 --> 05:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
involving trying to Define religion
 
05:19:51.948 --> 05:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
trying to Define religious beliefs
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
trying to Define what a compelling
 
05:19:55.350 --> 05:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
interest would be and trying to Define
 
05:19:58.110 --> 05:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
what narrowly tailored means means
 
05:20:00.910 --> 05:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
follow up means follow
 
05:20:03.708 --> 05:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
up let me see if I can ask the question
 
05:20:03.718 --> 05:20:04.670 align:start position:0%
up let me see if I can ask the question
more

05:20:04.670 --> 05:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:20:08.470 --> 05:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
simply anyone seeking to bring such a a
 
05:20:09.750 --> 05:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
a set of
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
claims would they not have already been
 
05:20:16.350 --> 05:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
able to bring similar claims against uh
 
05:20:19.110 --> 05:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know based on our constitution for
 
05:20:20.830 --> 05:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
as long as that's been around I must be
 
05:20:20.840 --> 05:20:27.070 align:start position:0%
as long as that's been around I must be
missing

05:20:27.070 --> 05:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:29.910 --> 05:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
something relative to claims under for
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
freedom of exerc free exercise of
 
05:20:35.390 --> 05:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
religion well I assume people have
 
05:20:37.628 --> 05:20:37.638 align:start position:0%
brought claims under free exercise for
 
05:20:39.548 --> 05:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
religion under the New Hampshire
 
05:20:41.270 --> 05:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution thank
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Alexander thank you
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:20:46.830 --> 05:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
question I guess you you brought up
 
05:20:48.190 --> 05:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
something I didn't even think about are
 
05:20:49.868 --> 05:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
you saying
 
05:20:52.708 --> 05:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
that a violate like a zoning ordinance
 
05:20:55.110 --> 05:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
that violates somebody's free exercise
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
of religion would allow them the
 
05:20:59.590 --> 05:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sue the town in violation
 
05:21:01.788 --> 05:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
of their freedom of religion under this
 
05:21:08.070 --> 05:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
bill so you can start but yeah um so as
 
05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
I was talking about the city of Bourne
 
05:21:13.948 --> 05:21:13.958 align:start position:0%
versus Flores um part of what
 
05:21:17.350 --> 05:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
so the area where the the um religious
 
05:21:19.510 --> 05:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
institution was the church was was a
 
05:21:22.110 --> 05:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
historic district they applied to get a
 
05:21:23.990 --> 05:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
building permit to extend their church
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
it was
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
denied um they made a claim under the
 
05:21:31.310 --> 05:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
federal rra saying that the denial of
 
05:21:34.470 --> 05:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
the permit violated their free exercise
 
05:21:37.868 --> 05:21:37.878 align:start position:0%
uh of religion um that decision was
 
05:21:37.878 --> 05:21:39.430 align:start position:0%
uh of religion um that decision was
never

05:21:39.430 --> 05:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
never
 
05:21:42.670 --> 05:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
you know never made so to speak because
 
05:21:44.910 --> 05:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
the the the Supreme new Hamp uh
 
05:21:46.110 --> 05:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the United States Supreme
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
Court found that it couldn't apply to
 
05:21:50.670 --> 05:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
States right um so that that is a
 
05:21:54.628 --> 05:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
concern is that the these types of cases
 
05:21:57.948 --> 05:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
zoning cases where it's a neutral uh a
 
05:22:00.110 --> 05:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
neutrally applicable zoning
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
law under this new statute and uh an
 
05:22:07.230 --> 05:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
entity could get denied a permit and
 
05:22:10.510 --> 05:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
bring a claim under this statute thank
 
05:22:12.070 --> 05:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
you that was great information for me
 
05:22:13.628 --> 05:22:13.638 align:start position:0%
and very helpful thank
 
05:22:16.750 --> 05:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:22:19.628 --> 05:22:19.638 align:start position:0%
bur I want to go back and revisit for a
 
05:22:24.390 --> 05:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
moment the the problem of lack of
 
05:22:28.270 --> 05:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
definition of religion or religious
 
05:22:30.510 --> 05:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
practice and whether you think it's
 
05:22:34.230 --> 05:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
necessary in a bill such as that this
 
05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
because and it's my question two of the
 
05:22:41.150 --> 05:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
three court cases were talking about the
 
05:22:44.430 --> 05:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire case and the Smith case
 
05:22:47.230 --> 05:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
both had to do with the question of
 
05:22:50.390 --> 05:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
whether the use of peyote which was
 
05:22:53.708 --> 05:22:53.718 align:start position:0%
banned by a law of General
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
applicability our criminal law or
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
whatever state it was criminal laws uh
 
05:23:03.510 --> 05:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
balanced against the religious needs and
 
05:23:06.750 --> 05:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
whether the use of peyote claimed to be
 
05:23:10.830 --> 05:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
for religious purposes and and I'm not
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
the one to decide whether it was or not
 
05:23:16.150 --> 05:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
is that problematic in a bill such as
 
05:23:19.070 --> 05:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
this when there's no mention at all
 
05:23:22.788 --> 05:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
about laws of General applicability in
 
05:23:28.190 --> 05:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:30.708 --> 05:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
balance can you rephrase your question
 
05:23:33.868 --> 05:23:33.878 align:start position:0%
I'm it's yeah moving around in my head
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
the ba the balance referred to in in
 
05:23:40.990 --> 05:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
like the Smith case uh had to do with
 
05:23:43.590 --> 05:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
you've got laws of general applicability
 
05:23:46.390 --> 05:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
and then you've got uh specific
 
05:23:46.400 --> 05:23:47.590 align:start position:0%
and then you've got uh specific
religious

05:23:47.590 --> 05:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
religious
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
claims and in doing the balance there's
 
05:23:53.310 --> 05:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
a standard of uh compelling State
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
interest uh least restrictive in
 
05:23:59.628 --> 05:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
ETC but if there's
 
05:24:04.030 --> 05:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
already no definition of religious or
 
05:24:07.390 --> 05:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
religion and there's no mention in here
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the whole concept of laws of General
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:18.990 --> 05:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
problematic am I any clear I would say
 
05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:29.270 --> 05:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
um how riffa could be used right um you
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
are correct there isn't anything in here
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
about laws um laws of General
 
05:24:36.548 --> 05:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
applicability um nor is there definition
 
05:24:39.510 --> 05:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
of religion I think this goes back to
 
05:24:42.110 --> 05:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
the complexity of legal actions that
 
05:24:44.430 --> 05:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
could could in fact take place under
 
05:24:49.070 --> 05:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
this under this uh proposed um bill that
 
05:24:51.948 --> 05:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
it would o this bill is Broad enough
 
05:24:55.150 --> 05:24:55.160 align:start position:0%
that it would allow for an it to become
 
05:24:57.030 --> 05:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
more complex at the time right you have
 
05:24:59.270 --> 05:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
general laws of
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
applicability and there's no definition
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
of religious religion or religious
 
05:25:06.270 --> 05:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
beliefs um so I think that would just
 
05:25:08.990 --> 05:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
amount to more complex and more time
 
05:25:12.670 --> 05:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
consuming um
 
05:25:15.910 --> 05:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
litigation any other questions seeing
 
05:25:18.110 --> 05:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
none thank
 
05:25:35.230 --> 05:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.868 --> 05:25:37.878 align:start position:0%
Trumble thank thank you Mr chairman my
 
05:25:39.430 --> 05:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
name is David Trumble I'm from the town
 
05:25:42.310 --> 05:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
of where um I just come with some basic
 
05:25:44.470 --> 05:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns about the bill uh
 
05:25:46.030 --> 05:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
going back to when the federal law was
 
05:25:48.750 --> 05:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
first passed with broad support uh it
 
05:25:51.910 --> 05:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
was seen as a way to make sure that
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
everybody could fre freely exercise
 
05:25:56.350 --> 05:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
their own religions and at that point in
 
05:25:58.150 --> 05:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
time I think we had as a society a
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
pretty common understanding that there
 
05:26:04.230 --> 05:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
was a hard line between free exercise
 
05:26:06.110 --> 05:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
and The Establishment Clause that the
 
05:26:08.350 --> 05:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
government was not in in any way
 
05:26:10.150 --> 05:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to be helping to establish
 
05:26:13.030 --> 05:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
religions there was a a test the lemon
 
05:26:14.350 --> 05:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
test would said
 
05:26:16.990 --> 05:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
that any assistance to religions had to
 
05:26:19.270 --> 05:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
be done solely or primarily for secular
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
purposes so I would you know certainly
 
05:26:23.788 --> 05:26:23.798 align:start position:0%
support uh they're not being laws that
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
would stop people from exercising their
 
05:26:27.548 --> 05:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
freedom of religion I just wanted to go
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
to the question that was raised by
 
05:26:31.628 --> 05:26:31.638 align:start position:0%
representative Smith which was about
 
05:26:33.788 --> 05:26:33.798 align:start position:0%
what about financial assistance from the
 
05:26:37.310 --> 05:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
government um because I think that's the
 
05:26:40.230 --> 05:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
the next area that's concerned and so
 
05:26:41.390 --> 05:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
the question is what if that the
 
05:26:43.070 --> 05:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
government has a program that has direct
 
05:26:45.868 --> 05:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
assistance and religion wants to access
 
05:26:48.910 --> 05:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
that direct assistance as I understand
 
05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
the uh answer from the prime sponsor he
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
indicated that that was not a problem
 
05:26:56.150 --> 05:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
because uh we're not giving any money
 
05:26:58.990 --> 05:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
directly to religious schools right now
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
so just and and he also said he thought
 
05:27:02.830 --> 05:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
that the construction statute was not
 
05:27:04.590 --> 05:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
really needed so I just want to be clear
 
05:27:06.548 --> 05:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
because the construction statute says
 
05:27:09.868 --> 05:27:09.878 align:start position:0%
that granting government funding to the
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
extent permissible Under The
 
05:27:13.990 --> 05:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
Establishment Clause shall not
 
05:27:15.868 --> 05:27:15.878 align:start position:0%
constitute a violation of this chapter
 
05:27:18.310 --> 05:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
so in other words that the government
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to give money to
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
religions to do things to the extent
 
05:27:24.150 --> 05:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
permissible Under The Establishment
 
05:27:25.830 --> 05:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
Clause so as long as everybody is in
 
05:27:28.270 --> 05:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
agreement that that means if what the
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
church is doing is primarily for a
 
05:27:34.110 --> 05:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
secular purpose and not to promote its
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
religious purposes then that would be uh
 
05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with the understanding that
 
05:27:43.030 --> 05:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
goes way back to what we understood in
 
05:27:45.628 --> 05:27:45.638 align:start position:0%
1990s when the federal law was passed so
 
05:27:47.110 --> 05:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you would run up
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
against serious problems in New
 
05:27:49.868 --> 05:27:49.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a
 
05:27:51.868 --> 05:27:51.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional um provision against
 
05:27:53.350 --> 05:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
money going to religious schools you
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
have a lot of civil rights issues
 
05:27:57.948 --> 05:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
involved that would involve civil rights
 
05:28:00.310 --> 05:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
not being applied at religious schools
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make sure that that
 
05:28:05.670 --> 05:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
as I was listening to this that it's the
 
05:28:07.788 --> 05:28:07.798 align:start position:0%
understanding of the legislature that
 
05:28:11.110 --> 05:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
this is not um this this is to stop as
 
05:28:13.190 --> 05:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
the Pastor said is to stop laws that
 
05:28:15.350 --> 05:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
would impose and restrict somebody's
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
freedom of practicing their religion
 
05:28:19.350 --> 05:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's not meant to authorize the
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
government to fund religion I just want
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that was issue was
 
05:28:24.788 --> 05:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
brought up and that there was
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
understanding on that thank you
 
05:28:29.788 --> 05:28:29.798 align:start position:0%
sir any
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
questions no seeing none thank you thank
 
05:28:34.390 --> 05:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
you that's the last card I have on House
 
05:28:36.430 --> 05:28:36.440 align:start position:0%

Gary Daniels I'm a representative from
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 43 representing the
 
05:32:28.270 --> 05:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
town of Milford I'm also Prime sponsor
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
05:32:32.910 --> 05:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
633 uh bipartisan bill that seeks a
 
05:32:35.470 --> 05:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
private sector solution to the housing
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
crisis through the use of housing invest
 
05:32:41.430 --> 05:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
Investment Trust New Hampshire faces a
 
05:32:44.150 --> 05:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
significant housing crisis with high
 
05:32:47.070 --> 05:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
rental costs and expensive home prices
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
leading to a shortage of affordable
 
05:32:52.590 --> 05:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
homes for working families and an and an
 
05:32:57.628 --> 05:32:57.638 align:start position:0%
expected deficit of 60,000 units by 2030
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
now I've always contended that I
 
05:33:01.948 --> 05:33:01.958 align:start position:0%
personally don't have the answers to all
 
05:33:05.150 --> 05:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the challenges before us but I've
 
05:33:07.868 --> 05:33:07.878 align:start position:0%
always contended that by working
 
05:33:11.070 --> 05:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
together we may find those Solutions in
 
05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
my last two terms as Senate Finance
 
05:33:15.788 --> 05:33:15.798 align:start position:0%
chair I recognized that we were pouring
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars into
 
05:33:21.270 --> 05:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
efforts to find a private sector excuse
 
05:33:23.708 --> 05:33:23.718 align:start position:0%
me a public sector solution to
 
05:33:26.270 --> 05:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
affordable housing yet the problem
 
05:33:27.548 --> 05:33:27.558 align:start position:0%
continued to
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
grow it therefore was intriguing to me
 
05:33:33.390 --> 05:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
when Michael del aano contacted me to
 
05:33:35.628 --> 05:33:35.638 align:start position:0%
discuss the idea of a private sector
 
05:33:38.548 --> 05:33:38.558 align:start position:0%
solution to housing an in ative idea
 
05:33:41.470 --> 05:33:41.480 align:start position:0%

only could we contribute to a solution

to the housing crisis but we could do it
 
05:33:49.470 --> 05:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
without adding to the state budget an
 
05:33:52.230 --> 05:33:52.240 align:start position:0%

the members to look at the trust

housing in New Hampshire um that that
 
05:37:09.670 --> 05:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
state desperately needs to act as a
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
magnet for younger working wage families
 
05:37:15.190 --> 05:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
enabled under
 
05:37:17.990 --> 05:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
293b the trust manages a series of
 
05:37:20.830 --> 05:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
subsidiary trusts that buy and renovate
 
05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
if needed uh Workforce housing units
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
funded by private donations and income
 
05:37:28.310 --> 05:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
qualified investors each subsidiary
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
trust in the series will own one
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
property title and um or a long-term
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
tency rights to a rental unit or an ad
 
05:37:42.788 --> 05:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
you um and holding these rights enables
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
the trust to maintain the affordability
 
05:37:48.110 --> 05:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
of that unit for multiple families and
 
05:37:50.270 --> 05:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
the economic model is really Simply
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
Built on the fact that one investment in
 
05:37:55.470 --> 05:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
one property serves many
 
05:37:58.230 --> 05:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
families and the trust financing
 
05:38:03.270 --> 05:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
structure was designed um to draw
 
05:38:03.280 --> 05:38:04.910 align:start position:0%
structure was designed um to draw
talented

05:38:04.910 --> 05:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
talented
 
05:38:07.830 --> 05:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh young families looking for career
 
05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities and to build wealth so
 
05:38:13.150 --> 05:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
that they can move out of these homes
 
05:38:14.990 --> 05:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
and buy their own
 
05:38:18.110 --> 05:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
home uh the trust will offer governance
 
05:38:20.590 --> 05:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
funding and counseling support to
 
05:38:23.670 --> 05:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
householders Across the state um with
 
05:38:25.868 --> 05:38:25.878 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take your questions
 
05:38:27.910 --> 05:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
05:38:31.470 --> 05:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
Oregon um it says there's no State uh
 
05:38:35.030 --> 05:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
taxes or revenues but um if it's a 501c3
 
05:38:37.948 --> 05:38:37.958 align:start position:0%
would these properties be subject to to
 
05:38:39.708 --> 05:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
property tax it seems like or would they
 
05:38:42.270 --> 05:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
be exempt from property tax well it's
 
05:38:43.948 --> 05:38:43.958 align:start position:0%
interesting you asked that we had
 
05:38:46.190 --> 05:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
discussions just on that matter uh with
 
05:38:49.590 --> 05:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
the I'm sorry yes we we discussed this
 
05:38:51.910 --> 05:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Revenue last week
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
and um they think that um on a Town
 
05:39:01.468 --> 05:39:01.478 align:start position:0%
Bytown basis uh would be a determination
 
05:39:04.350 --> 05:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
because the way it's my walk away
 
05:39:06.910 --> 05:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
Takeaway on it was that every year a
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
form needs to be filled out uh asking
 
05:39:12.468 --> 05:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
for an exemption which is pretty
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
honorous if we are spread across the
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
state different towns so it's unlikely
 
05:39:18.868 --> 05:39:18.878 align:start position:0%
that we'll go after any kind of
 
05:39:21.510 --> 05:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
charitable deduction unless there is a
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
charitable purpose that demands that
 
05:39:28.150 --> 05:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
kind of treatment and that's based on
 
05:39:29.628 --> 05:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
who sponsors the
 
05:39:32.910 --> 05:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
home right if the town for example wants
 
05:39:36.510 --> 05:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
to uh sponsor a home in the trust uh
 
05:39:37.910 --> 05:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's their prerogative whether they
 
05:39:39.708 --> 05:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
collect taxes on it or not but they'll
 
05:39:39.718 --> 05:39:40.948 align:start position:0%
collect taxes on it or not but they'll
tell

05:39:40.948 --> 05:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
tell
 
05:39:44.670 --> 05:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
US Representative Perez you thanks for
 
05:39:47.390 --> 05:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question this is way above my
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
pay grade I was a nurse for 42 years so
 
05:39:52.230 --> 05:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
I have two quick questions first of all
 
05:39:54.230 --> 05:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
do you have investors lined up already
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
that are interested in this
 
05:40:00.510 --> 05:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
well right now it's way too early to
 
05:40:03.150 --> 05:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
solicit money um the process that we're
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
going through is to establish this in
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
law and over the next summer work with
 
05:40:09.868 --> 05:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
the attorneys to fill in the gaps and
 
05:40:12.230 --> 05:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
answer all the questions like the tax
 
05:40:16.030 --> 05:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
question that just came up so um I am
 
05:40:18.990 --> 05:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
starting to get investment calls I got
 
05:40:21.590 --> 05:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
calls just yesterday from Wellington
 
05:40:24.788 --> 05:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
Management which is a well-known fund uh
 
05:40:27.030 --> 05:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
asking me how much money we need so
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of capital out
 
05:40:31.350 --> 05:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
there chasing opportunity but we're not
 
05:40:33.310 --> 05:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
ready to accept it second question
 
05:40:37.350 --> 05:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
quickly go ahead my concern is about big
 
05:40:41.670 --> 05:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
conglomerates coming in and buying up
 
05:40:44.590 --> 05:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
and being part of this from out of state
 
05:40:46.788 --> 05:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
and that's my concern is there going to
 
05:40:50.468 --> 05:40:50.478 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate any regulations around
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining it
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
as I
 
05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
mean whatever your concern is
 
05:40:58.320 --> 05:41:01.270 align:start position:0%
mean whatever your concern is
well-founded

05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
well-founded
 
05:41:06.430 --> 05:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
um we're asking the governor to appoint
 
05:41:09.110 --> 05:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh the board of director s and the
 
05:41:12.430 --> 05:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
trustees uh and to establish this as a
 
05:41:15.430 --> 05:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
public private cooperation or
 
05:41:17.628 --> 05:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
collaboration where the state will have
 
05:41:19.628 --> 05:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
their finger on the steering wheel but
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
it'll be a privately funded organization
 
05:41:24.990 --> 05:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
running it just to avoid the situation
 
05:41:26.910 --> 05:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
that you're talking
 
05:41:29.948 --> 05:41:29.958 align:start position:0%
about representative
 
05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um I I need
 
05:41:38.750 --> 05:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
help I don't understand understand where
 
05:41:43.548 --> 05:41:43.558 align:start position:0%
the money is going to come from why if
 
05:41:43.558 --> 05:41:44.390 align:start position:0%
the money is going to come from why if
this

05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:41:46.590 --> 05:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
is a good
 
05:41:51.190 --> 05:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:55.110 --> 05:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
someone contribute to this rather than
 
05:41:58.310 --> 05:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
just go and do exactly what you're
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
asking out there in the free
 
05:42:04.390 --> 05:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
market great question
 
05:42:06.910 --> 05:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
um you know when people say it's a great
 
05:42:08.670 --> 05:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
question question I'm always curious
 
05:42:12.750 --> 05:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
about what they mean well it it for my
 
05:42:16.590 --> 05:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
it to to me it means uh your perception
 
05:42:21.270 --> 05:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
of the situation is Right On Target
 
05:42:23.590 --> 05:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's the question that you're answering
 
05:42:27.310 --> 05:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
is who gets what and when and the
 
05:42:28.990 --> 05:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
capital investors out there now are
 
05:42:30.670 --> 05:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
looking for double-digit returns and
 
05:42:32.990 --> 05:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
they're not getting any they're willing
 
05:42:35.548 --> 05:42:35.558 align:start position:0%
to accept market rate returns for
 
05:42:38.070 --> 05:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
example mortgage bonds
 
05:42:40.230 --> 05:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh when Banks originate mortgages and
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
they sell them to the secondary Market
 
05:42:44.830 --> 05:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
those are packaged and sold to investors
 
05:42:48.150 --> 05:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
earning earning rates that are driven by
 
05:42:50.070 --> 05:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
the market that are in the range of
 
05:42:52.350 --> 05:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
something just less than the mortgage
 
05:42:54.948 --> 05:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
rates um and that those are the
 
05:42:57.590 --> 05:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
investors that we would be looking for
 
05:43:00.910 --> 05:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
that want an a return on and return of
 
05:43:03.830 --> 05:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
investment that is fair but this is also
 
05:43:06.548 --> 05:43:06.558 align:start position:0%
a socially responsible investment so you
 
05:43:08.708 --> 05:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
have a whole cohort of investors that do
 
05:43:11.670 --> 05:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
nothing but invest in this kind of thing
 
05:43:13.750 --> 05:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
the structure is set up so that it
 
05:43:16.230 --> 05:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
conforms with the 1940s Investment Trust
 
05:43:19.430 --> 05:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
act which is federal legislation
 
05:43:22.830 --> 05:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
293b the state statute RSA is the
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
state's enablement to allow companies
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
and organizations in New Hampshire to
 
05:43:30.230 --> 05:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
operate under the 1940s Investment Trust
 
05:43:34.150 --> 05:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
act the Investment Trust Act is what uh
 
05:43:37.628 --> 05:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
ETFs and mutual funds and re
 
05:43:41.030 --> 05:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
operate under and the point being is
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
that if we can get an up up running
 
05:43:47.190 --> 05:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
prototype that this is scalable to
 
05:43:51.510 --> 05:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
attract money nationally through things
 
05:43:54.548 --> 05:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
like mutual funds uh that would socially
 
05:43:56.468 --> 05:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
responsible mutual funds that would take
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
a return on investment that is
 
05:44:00.390 --> 05:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
commensurate with what we can afford to
 
05:44:04.510 --> 05:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:12.350 --> 05:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:15.548 --> 05:44:15.558 align:start position:0%
I recognize your good faith in answering
 
05:44:19.390 --> 05:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
um it answers my question it doesn't
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
satisfy my concerns you if I may please
 
05:44:31.590 --> 05:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
followup okay okay representative
 
05:44:37.830 --> 05:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
McFarland thank you thank you Mr
 
05:44:42.390 --> 05:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
chairman so I I I have to to use um
 
05:44:44.868 --> 05:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's term concerns
 
05:44:46.948 --> 05:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
that I would like to clarify your intent
 
05:44:48.350 --> 05:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
with you
 
05:44:51.390 --> 05:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
on first of all and I know we already
 
05:44:54.868 --> 05:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
touched on the question of If This Were
 
05:44:57.310 --> 05:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
to pass this is what the statutory
 
05:45:00.150 --> 05:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
impact might be on property tax but if
 
05:45:01.430 --> 05:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
05:45:05.310 --> 05:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
intent would you agree that it would be
 
05:45:09.150 --> 05:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
wholly wrong for these trusts holding
 
05:45:15.190 --> 05:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:19.350 --> 05:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
tax TR not let me sure if I understand
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
your question you're asking my opinion
 
05:45:25.468 --> 05:45:25.478 align:start position:0%
on whether the intent is to set it up as
 
05:45:28.468 --> 05:45:28.478 align:start position:0%
a charity to avoid
 
05:45:31.910 --> 05:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
taxation uh I I let me rephrase what I'm
 
05:45:34.948 --> 05:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
asking as I'm asking the intent of the
 
05:45:36.708 --> 05:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor and yourself with regard
 
05:45:41.190 --> 05:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
to to whether your expectation is that
 
05:45:44.868 --> 05:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
even with these vehicles in
 
05:45:47.708 --> 05:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
place would you not agree
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
that we should see property taxes being
 
05:45:55.030 --> 05:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
paid on these houses I think so uh all
 
05:45:57.150 --> 05:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
the numbers build in the property tax at
 
05:46:00.070 --> 05:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
the fair market value based on advolum
 
05:46:05.390 --> 05:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
taxation follow up follow up
 
05:46:08.788 --> 05:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
so why then and and and I appreciate all
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
the words that you have
 
05:46:14.948 --> 05:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
spoken but I I'm maybe I'm um tired this
 
05:46:18.350 --> 05:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon I I I guess I am not
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
understanding why this is something that
 
05:46:23.230 --> 05:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
should be the subject of a charitable
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
organization rather than a conventional
 
05:46:30.510 --> 05:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:34.270 --> 05:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
um you need to understand first off is
 
05:46:36.910 --> 05:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
that it isn't what the property is worth
 
05:46:39.030 --> 05:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
that matters it's what the trust pays
 
05:46:41.350 --> 05:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
for it the lower the cost of the
 
05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
property the more effective the trust
 
05:46:46.430 --> 05:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
can be to serve the target
 
05:46:49.390 --> 05:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
audience it's a charity one of the
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
primary reasons it's a charity is the
 
05:46:54.468 --> 05:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
concept of a bargan sale and bargain
 
05:46:58.990 --> 05:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
sale under is rules allows a homeowner
 
05:47:01.788 --> 05:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
in this case to sell their property to
 
05:47:01.798 --> 05:47:02.628 align:start position:0%
in this case to sell their property to
the

05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:47:07.190 --> 05:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
trust and take at a a price below its
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
market value and take a charitable
 
05:47:14.110 --> 05:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
donation in lie of cash so let me give
 
05:47:16.150 --> 05:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
you an example if you had somebody who
 
05:47:17.628 --> 05:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
had a million dollar home and their
 
05:47:20.670 --> 05:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
basis was half a million dollars they
 
05:47:23.030 --> 05:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
would have a capital gain on that half a
 
05:47:26.350 --> 05:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
million in excess of their basis at a
 
05:47:28.948 --> 05:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
20% tax bracket they would have a tax of
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
$100,000 in a very rough numbers and of
 
05:47:33.110 --> 05:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
course the CPAs would have to work with
 
05:47:36.270 --> 05:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
the donor if they had sold that home to
 
05:47:37.628 --> 05:47:37.638 align:start position:0%
the trust at
 
05:47:39.868 --> 05:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
900,000 they would get a tax deduction
 
05:47:41.788 --> 05:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
for 100,000 and walk away with the same
 
05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money but without having to
 
05:47:46.310 --> 05:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
pay a tax but the trust would be
 
05:47:48.708 --> 05:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of a property at a lower
 
05:47:52.070 --> 05:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
price which we could then um subdivide
 
05:47:53.868 --> 05:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
into multiple units to expand the
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
housing Supply so is that kind of
 
05:47:58.430 --> 05:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism that we're trying to leverage
 
05:48:01.230 --> 05:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
with the charitable
 
05:48:03.110 --> 05:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
basis thank
 
05:48:06.110 --> 05:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
you representative B rbo then
 
05:48:08.788 --> 05:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
representative B you can you tell us
 
05:48:10.110 --> 05:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
05:48:12.788 --> 05:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
tell us how this has worked elsewhere uh
 
05:48:16.868 --> 05:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
or if this structure has been deployed
 
05:48:18.548 --> 05:48:18.558 align:start position:0%
uh in other jurisdictions how it's
 
05:48:21.468 --> 05:48:21.478 align:start position:0%
worked or what what problems may have
 
05:48:24.910 --> 05:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
Arisen most of the uh
 
05:48:28.190 --> 05:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable um fact similes of this use
 
05:48:30.070 --> 05:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
real estate investment trusts and what
 
05:48:32.788 --> 05:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
they call shared Equity Arrangements
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
where the Real Estate Investment Trust
 
05:48:37.150 --> 05:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
buys the land and the homeowner buys the
 
05:48:39.190 --> 05:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
improvements above the land and finances
 
05:48:43.030 --> 05:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
them in fact FHA has a whole program on
 
05:48:48.110 --> 05:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
on land trust model uh financing where
 
05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
um they will accept the ground rent or
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
the ground the ground lease as a basis
 
05:48:55.628 --> 05:48:55.638 align:start position:0%
for long-term
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
debt um so I spent a lot of time with um
 
05:49:03.510 --> 05:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
the folks that developed the Burlington
 
05:49:06.830 --> 05:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
Land Trust model um and the the
 
05:49:09.110 --> 05:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys that helped them craft that
 
05:49:11.190 --> 05:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
back years ago when I first
 
05:49:14.670 --> 05:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
started um one of the problems that that
 
05:49:17.468 --> 05:49:17.478 align:start position:0%
model has is Property Management over
 
05:49:19.270 --> 05:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
that single family home and a
 
05:49:21.070 --> 05:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
distributed environment became very
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
problematic for them and that's why you
 
05:49:25.670 --> 05:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
typically see Land Trust models are
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
clustered like in Burlington
 
05:49:30.510 --> 05:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont um what this gives us is the
 
05:49:33.070 --> 05:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have
 
05:49:35.548 --> 05:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
independently operated trusts each
 
05:49:38.990 --> 05:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
subsidiary trust is it is its own uh
 
05:49:42.830 --> 05:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
entity with its own tax reporting it
 
05:49:45.990 --> 05:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
does a couple of things it allows um
 
05:49:49.030 --> 05:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
what we call directed investment so if
 
05:49:52.548 --> 05:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
an employer or a hospital wanted to
 
05:49:55.590 --> 05:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
invest in some of these homes for nurses
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
they could directly invest in specific
 
05:50:00.390 --> 05:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
units and so the the structure we're
 
05:50:02.788 --> 05:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
giving gives us the flexibility to have
 
05:50:05.510 --> 05:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
multiple classes of investors as well as
 
05:50:08.310 --> 05:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
directed investors employers can invest
 
05:50:10.110 --> 05:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
in a particular unit that's close to
 
05:50:12.270 --> 05:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
their place of
 
05:50:14.590 --> 05:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
work guess I'm asking has that been done
 
05:50:16.868 --> 05:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
in other places and how is it how has it
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
succeeded I'm sorry I didn't quite
 
05:50:19.708 --> 05:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
you're describing for instance that
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
nurses or the employer wanting to invest
 
05:50:24.190 --> 05:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
in you know one of the sub trusts for
 
05:50:26.468 --> 05:50:26.478 align:start position:0%
the employees how has that worked out in
 
05:50:28.310 --> 05:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
other instances you talked about the
 
05:50:30.310 --> 05:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
property management concerns right that
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
with the land trust that you
 
05:50:35.270 --> 05:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
described I'm just I'm just looking for
 
05:50:36.910 --> 05:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
more feedback on the experience of
 
05:50:38.468 --> 05:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
working with the structure there is
 
05:50:40.990 --> 05:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
nothing out there that operates the way
 
05:50:44.110 --> 05:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
this structure is set up okay it is set
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
up though taking the best parts of the
 
05:50:49.548 --> 05:50:49.558 align:start position:0%
models that are out there and creating a
 
05:50:52.030 --> 05:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
unique environment for a first
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
internation opportunity for New
 
05:50:55.350 --> 05:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Burch first and
 
05:51:02.310 --> 05:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
then thank you Mr chair uh and thank you
 
05:51:06.030 --> 05:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
for uh for taking my questions I'm
 
05:51:08.590 --> 05:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out some of the tax
 
05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
consequences or whether this is how much
 
05:51:15.948 --> 05:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
of this is simply at some level uh uh a
 
05:51:15.958 --> 05:51:16.868 align:start position:0%
of this is simply at some level uh uh a
tax

05:51:16.868 --> 05:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
tax
 
05:51:19.868 --> 05:51:19.878 align:start position:0%
avoidance system in terms of what towns
 
05:51:22.750 --> 05:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
or the state collects in terms of real
 
05:51:28.270 --> 05:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
estate taxes so if I understand um this
 
05:51:30.468 --> 05:51:30.478 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
05:51:32.590 --> 05:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
rlf uh
 
05:51:37.510 --> 05:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
buys a an existing home from somebody
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
and there's some benefits to the seller
 
05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
by using the
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
charitable um tax rate instead of the
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
regular tax rate to put it in elegantly
 
05:51:52.150 --> 05:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
but as you described 100,000 and you
 
05:51:54.788 --> 05:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to pay as many much taxes
 
05:51:58.110 --> 05:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh capital gains and then the
 
05:52:02.390 --> 05:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
rlf sits there and and tries to fill
 
05:52:05.030 --> 05:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
that house with a homeowner the
 
05:52:07.708 --> 05:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
homeowner is GNA pay the real estate
 
05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
taxes the utilities and everything else
 
05:52:14.070 --> 05:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
but doesn't have ownership in
 
05:52:19.990 --> 05:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
it perhaps at some point the rlf sells
 
05:52:22.990 --> 05:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
that property to an
 
05:52:26.830 --> 05:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
individual and presumably there's a t
 
05:52:31.110 --> 05:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
that generates a taxable event yeah yeah
 
05:52:33.830 --> 05:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm getting lost here who pays what
 
05:52:36.750 --> 05:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
taxes so first first of all the
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan Fund is a separate
 
05:52:41.150 --> 05:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization that we have no
 
05:52:41.160 --> 05:52:42.548 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization that we have no
control

05:52:42.548 --> 05:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:52:46.190 --> 05:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
over it is a funding
 
05:52:47.910 --> 05:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism the
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
charity the housing Investment
 
05:52:54.750 --> 05:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
Trust relies on the revolving Loan Fund
 
05:52:57.708 --> 05:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
as a funding source okay it's an arms
 
05:53:01.390 --> 05:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
lent transaction they do not hold title
 
05:53:04.110 --> 05:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
to any of the trust property however
 
05:53:06.990 --> 05:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
they do have collateral
 
05:53:09.190 --> 05:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
um beneficial interests in the trust
 
05:53:13.150 --> 05:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
property as a lender would normally have
 
05:53:13.160 --> 05:53:14.830 align:start position:0%
property as a lender would normally have
okay

05:53:14.830 --> 05:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:53:19.070 --> 05:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
so in terms of Taxation on the revolving
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund um whatever they would pay in
 
05:53:23.468 --> 05:53:23.478 align:start position:0%
taxes they're going to
 
05:53:28.670 --> 05:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
pay um in terms of Taxation with the the
 
05:53:31.830 --> 05:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
trust uh there would be no uh business
 
05:53:34.868 --> 05:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax because it is a charity
 
05:53:37.070 --> 05:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know transfer taxes and such would
 
05:53:44.868 --> 05:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
all be paid in in the um operation of
 
05:53:46.830 --> 05:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
acquiring and
 
05:53:50.310 --> 05:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
selling uh the properties that the trust
 
05:53:53.788 --> 05:53:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.350 --> 05:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
that and that would be paid at a normal
 
05:53:59.430 --> 05:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
taxable rate or is there some different
 
05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
rate if a charity is buying or selling
 
05:54:04.468 --> 05:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
well I think what you're going to find
 
05:54:06.910 --> 05:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
over the course of the year and and
 
05:54:09.270 --> 05:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
conversation with the attorneys that
 
05:54:12.030 --> 05:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to use to structure this is
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
that uh the transfer tax on an exchange
 
05:54:17.638 --> 05:54:18.390 align:start position:0%
that uh the transfer tax on an exchange
of

05:54:18.390 --> 05:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:54:22.190 --> 05:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
property um would
 
05:54:26.110 --> 05:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
be that portion of the property that the
 
05:54:29.070 --> 05:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
householder purchases so the trust owns
 
05:54:31.590 --> 05:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
the property has title whatever taxes
 
05:54:33.270 --> 05:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
are paid to own the property in the
 
05:54:35.670 --> 05:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
trust that's done so now what the trust
 
05:54:38.990 --> 05:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
does is it has a householder that comes
 
05:54:43.110 --> 05:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
in and acquires a beneficial interest in
 
05:54:46.468 --> 05:54:46.478 align:start position:0%
that specific trust and it's like seller
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
financing the trust provides them with a
 
05:54:54.270 --> 05:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
loan to acquire that beneficial interest
 
05:54:57.150 --> 05:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
now that acquisition is a transfer of
 
05:54:59.788 --> 05:54:59.798 align:start position:0%
beneficial interest which is taxable and
 
05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
on the back end when that property sells
 
05:55:04.350 --> 05:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
is a transfer of beneficial interest
 
05:55:06.990 --> 05:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
that is collected again
 
05:55:09.190 --> 05:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
um what we're hoping to see is that they
 
05:55:11.548 --> 05:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
pay a transfer tax on the portion of
 
05:55:13.708 --> 05:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
beneficial interest that they acquire
 
05:55:15.788 --> 05:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
not a tax on the entire value of the
 
05:55:18.750 --> 05:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
property but we're not sure just yet if
 
05:55:22.030 --> 05:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
how that mechanism will work so taxes
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
will be paid in hopefully in proportion
 
05:55:26.310 --> 05:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
to what they
 
05:55:29.868 --> 05:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
own thank you representative McFarland
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
just following up on representative
 
05:55:35.708 --> 05:55:35.718 align:start position:0%
Rambo's line of questioning so can you
 
05:55:36.990 --> 05:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
explain to
 
05:55:40.910 --> 05:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
me uh You' you've painted a picture of
 
05:55:46.190 --> 05:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
certain scenarios um where we we are
 
05:55:47.590 --> 05:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
supposed I think
 
05:55:51.948 --> 05:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
to infer a social good but you've also
 
05:55:54.990 --> 05:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
painted a picture where for example you
 
05:55:58.910 --> 05:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
have a hospital using this as script
 
05:56:00.590 --> 05:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
housing for their
 
05:56:04.270 --> 05:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce you've painted a picture where
 
05:56:09.750 --> 05:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
um the the housing units could remain
 
05:56:12.708 --> 05:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
within this housing Investment Trust for
 
05:56:15.990 --> 05:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
a long period of
 
05:56:20.030 --> 05:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
time are you not by create by by you
 
05:56:21.350 --> 05:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
know submitting this pill are you not
 
05:56:23.548 --> 05:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
submitting something that is going to
 
05:56:26.110 --> 05:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
distort the marketplace for other
 
05:56:28.708 --> 05:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
builders and are you suggesting that in
 
05:56:30.110 --> 05:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
your hospital
 
05:56:32.590 --> 05:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
example uh the the hospital would make
 
05:56:35.350 --> 05:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
the property available uh at at you know
 
05:56:36.868 --> 05:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
a fair market rent
 
05:56:39.310 --> 05:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
to all comers or or just to their own
 
05:56:39.320 --> 05:56:40.948 align:start position:0%
to all comers or or just to their own
staff

05:56:40.948 --> 05:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
staff
 
05:56:43.708 --> 05:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
well first of all your your question
 
05:56:45.628 --> 05:56:45.638 align:start position:0%
about Market
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
Distortion um a 100 homes is going to
 
05:56:51.310 --> 05:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
cost us $50 million a th000 homes will
 
05:56:55.030 --> 05:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
cost us 5 billion at a median price of
 
05:56:57.270 --> 05:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
$500,000 obviously not every house in
 
05:56:59.350 --> 05:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
the state is worth 500,000 but give or
 
05:57:01.468 --> 05:57:01.478 align:start position:0%
take a few billion dollars so there's an
 
05:57:05.310 --> 05:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
economy of scale here that we are very
 
05:57:09.070 --> 05:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
unlikely we got 640,000 units in the
 
05:57:11.708 --> 05:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
state th000 units is not going to
 
05:57:15.468 --> 05:57:15.478 align:start position:0%
distort anything um what the purpose of
 
05:57:19.350 --> 05:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
this is is to provide a steady inventory
 
05:57:22.150 --> 05:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
of Workforce housing that is available
 
05:57:25.270 --> 05:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis to multiple families
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
in 2008 when I worked with the housing
 
05:57:31.270 --> 05:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
authority to craft the uh Workforce
 
05:57:34.468 --> 05:57:34.478 align:start position:0%
housing uh documentation that was used
 
05:57:36.670 --> 05:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh when the bill first came out
 
05:57:39.868 --> 05:57:39.878 align:start position:0%
uh we never imagined that these homes
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
that were allowed under um 674
 
05:57:48.070 --> 05:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
58 um would be um capitalized on by
 
05:57:51.230 --> 05:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
buyers you go find a Workforce housing
 
05:57:54.628 --> 05:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
unit that was allowed by law uh and try
 
05:57:57.670 --> 05:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
and buy it today and so the problem one
 
05:57:59.030 --> 05:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
of the problems that we're trying to
 
05:58:02.110 --> 05:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
solve here is to hold that unit for its
 
05:58:05.468 --> 05:58:05.478 align:start position:0%
intended purpose and I'm not saying
 
05:58:07.948 --> 05:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
they'll be held forever the trust can
 
05:58:10.310 --> 05:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
sell them if the municipality for
 
05:58:13.628 --> 05:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
example says to us here's an example
 
05:58:17.030 --> 05:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
municipality under 674 allows Workforce
 
05:58:20.070 --> 05:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
housing as part of a development we're
 
05:58:22.230 --> 05:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
asking that we'll be asking that
 
05:58:26.030 --> 05:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
municipality to sell us that home at the
 
05:58:28.510 --> 05:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
price set by the Housing
 
05:58:32.310 --> 05:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
Authority now assuming we buy it and now
 
05:58:35.628 --> 05:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
we'll hold that to that price as long as
 
05:58:38.070 --> 05:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
admin IP ality who allowed that house to
 
05:58:40.270 --> 05:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
be built they have covidence on it they
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
say 20 years well at the end of 20
 
05:58:46.190 --> 05:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
years we can dispose of that property
 
05:58:47.948 --> 05:58:47.958 align:start position:0%
and any profit that's made on that would
 
05:58:49.948 --> 05:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
go be circulated back into buying more
 
05:58:52.670 --> 05:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
affordable housing so our intent is not
 
05:58:55.190 --> 05:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
to lock down and create some private
 
05:58:57.868 --> 05:58:57.878 align:start position:0%
rent control but rather to preserve the
 
05:59:00.190 --> 05:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
housing stock so that we could serve as
 
05:59:02.708 --> 05:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
many families as possible with that
 
05:59:05.590 --> 05:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
entry level price the whole purpose here
 
05:59:08.468 --> 05:59:08.478 align:start position:0%
is to get a home occupied at an
 
05:59:10.708 --> 05:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
entry-level price and make subsequent
 
05:59:12.990 --> 05:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
buyers make that available to subsequent
 
05:59:15.468 --> 05:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
buyers at the same price that the first
 
05:59:18.270 --> 05:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
buyer had so we're not looking to raise
 
05:59:20.590 --> 05:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
the price there is zero Equity
 
05:59:22.430 --> 05:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
appreciation built into the numbers
 
05:59:24.430 --> 05:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
everything is assumed that it's our
 
05:59:27.270 --> 05:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
basis is our basis and every subsequent
 
05:59:29.350 --> 05:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
buyer will have the opportunity to buy
 
05:59:32.190 --> 05:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
at that basis one of the other problems
 
05:59:33.990 --> 05:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's happening right now is because of
 
05:59:36.030 --> 05:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
the mortgage rate homes that have been
 
05:59:37.430 --> 05:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
purchased under the workforce housing
 
05:59:41.110 --> 05:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
law at low interest rates are now trying
 
05:59:42.948 --> 05:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
to sell those Homes at a higher interest
 
05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
rate and the capitalized value of that
 
05:59:47.150 --> 05:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
home is less than what they paid for it
 
05:59:48.310 --> 05:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
even though they bought it as a
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing unit in this situation
 
05:59:53.430 --> 05:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
they don't hold title to the property so
 
05:59:55.788 --> 05:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
if they want to leave all they have to
 
05:59:57.590 --> 05:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
do is give us 30 days notice and we give
 
05:59:59.708 --> 05:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
them a check for their builtup Equity
 
06:00:01.350 --> 06:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
the purpose being is to be able to get
 
06:00:03.230 --> 06:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
them into a position where they can grow
 
06:00:06.230 --> 06:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
roots in the community take jobs grow
 
06:00:08.430 --> 06:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
wealth sufficient so that they have a
 
06:00:10.110 --> 06:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
nest egg that they can invest in their
 
06:00:13.190 --> 06:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
own property in that community and then
 
06:00:16.430 --> 06:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
bring another family and at the same
 
06:00:20.750 --> 06:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:23.788 --> 06:00:23.798 align:start position:0%
question uh I I appreciate the answer I
 
06:00:27.468 --> 06:00:27.478 align:start position:0%
think I have the answer that I need um I
 
06:00:28.750 --> 06:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it addresses my
 
06:00:30.350 --> 06:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
question thank

it's against all my instincts to not
talk

06:16:18.468 --> 06:16:18.478 align:start position:0%

06:16:21.230 --> 06:16:21.240 align:start position:0%

money
 
06:16:36.270 --> 06:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's very rare that I get to say that
 
06:16:40.868 --> 06:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
um so what we're talking about is uh the
 
06:16:42.548 --> 06:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
something called the recruitment statute
 
06:16:44.270 --> 06:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a very brief overview of
 
06:16:47.868 --> 06:16:47.878 align:start position:0%
the recruitment statute uh many years
 
06:16:53.070 --> 06:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
ago uh uh the legislature passed a bill
 
06:16:56.590 --> 06:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
that said uh when somebody is appointed
 
06:16:59.990 --> 06:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
a public defender or a private court
 
06:17:03.830 --> 06:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
appointed lawyer the state has uh the
 
06:17:09.230 --> 06:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
state sh shall recoup money uh from uh
 
06:17:14.270 --> 06:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
that person at a uh a set fee A reduced
 
06:17:19.270 --> 06:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
fee um um it is for at least at one
 
06:17:21.910 --> 06:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
point it was around $800 for a
 
06:17:24.390 --> 06:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor uh so it didn't and that
 
06:17:26.948 --> 06:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
money that was recouped went into the
 
06:17:29.750 --> 06:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
general fund it didn't go to the
 
06:17:32.628 --> 06:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
Indigent defense fund uh it didn't it
 
06:17:36.270 --> 06:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't a mechanism for funding uh
 
06:17:38.230 --> 06:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
Indigent defense Services it just went
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
into the general fund uh and what would
 
06:17:43.190 --> 06:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
happen What originally happened is the
 
06:17:45.230 --> 06:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:17:47.708 --> 06:17:47.718 align:start position:0%
uh an individual who wanted a courta
 
06:17:50.110 --> 06:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
appointed lawyer would file a financial
 
06:17:53.510 --> 06:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit usually at arraignment the
 
06:17:55.110 --> 06:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
judge would look at the financial
 
06:17:58.030 --> 06:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit appoint a lawyer and then look
 
06:18:01.110 --> 06:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
at the financial affidavit to decide
 
06:18:03.628 --> 06:18:03.638 align:start position:0%
whether to send the case to the office
 
06:18:06.750 --> 06:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
of Cost Containment which is a a uh
 
06:18:08.110 --> 06:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
office that's a part of the Department
 
06:18:11.190 --> 06:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
of administrative Services uh that
 
06:18:15.510 --> 06:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
process was essentially Auto relatively
 
06:18:21.270 --> 06:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
automatic um and um and so uh and as a
 
06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
part of that process uh it was also the
 
06:18:28.868 --> 06:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
case that uh the that occurred at the
 
06:18:31.270 --> 06:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of the case which meant that
 
06:18:33.468 --> 06:18:33.478 align:start position:0%
even if somebody were found not guilty
 
06:18:35.788 --> 06:18:35.798 align:start position:0%
on all the charges or all the charges
 
06:18:38.468 --> 06:18:38.478 align:start position:0%
were dismissed they would still recuit
 
06:18:41.350 --> 06:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
they would still recruit money um
 
06:18:45.030 --> 06:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
several years ago about uh five or six
 
06:18:48.110 --> 06:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
years ago now uh this this committee and
 
06:18:50.270 --> 06:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature made changes uh to the
 
06:18:53.670 --> 06:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
recruitment process it said uh from now
 
06:18:56.110 --> 06:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
on we're not going to rec recoup money
 
06:18:58.350 --> 06:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
from people who have been found not
 
06:19:00.468 --> 06:19:00.478 align:start position:0%
guilty in all the charges or had all the
 
06:19:02.990 --> 06:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
charges dismissed number one and number
 
06:19:05.030 --> 06:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
two we're going to move the moment that
 
06:19:07.590 --> 06:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
the judge makes a determination as to
 
06:19:09.430 --> 06:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
whether to send the case to the office
 
06:19:12.430 --> 06:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
of Cost Containment for recruitment uh
 
06:19:14.390 --> 06:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the sentencing
 
06:19:17.468 --> 06:19:17.478 align:start position:0%
hearing um and what has happened is that
 
06:19:20.230 --> 06:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
judges have I've talked to a number of
 
06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
Judges about this what has happened is
 
06:19:24.910 --> 06:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
judges have said what effectively said
 
06:19:26.990 --> 06:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
to themselves well I'm finding this
 
06:19:27.000 --> 06:19:28.590 align:start position:0%
to themselves well I'm finding this
person

06:19:28.590 --> 06:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
person
 
06:19:33.310 --> 06:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
$500 I'm um uh I'm perhaps in that case
 
06:19:35.548 --> 06:19:35.558 align:start position:0%
ordering a restitution
 
06:19:37.590 --> 06:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to take another look at
 
06:19:39.750 --> 06:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
the updated financial affidavit it
 
06:19:43.310 --> 06:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense for me to be also
 
06:19:46.468 --> 06:19:46.478 align:start position:0%
ordering recruitment uh as a financial
 
06:19:49.030 --> 06:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
matter once judges started looking at
 
06:19:52.510 --> 06:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
individual cases on a case-by Case basis
 
06:19:55.590 --> 06:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
they really in large num stop stopped
 
06:19:57.548 --> 06:19:57.558 align:start position:0%
sending cases to the office of Cost
 
06:20:00.948 --> 06:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
Containment thereby the large reduction
 
06:20:02.948 --> 06:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
in the amount of money that the office
 
06:20:05.670 --> 06:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
of Cost Containment is has been
 
06:20:05.680 --> 06:20:08.670 align:start position:0%
of Cost Containment is has been
collecting

06:20:08.670 --> 06:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
06:20:13.230 --> 06:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
um at I I think the um
 
06:20:16.830 --> 06:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
um the financial note uh describes uh
 
06:20:20.590 --> 06:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
where we are now um and I know the
 
06:20:23.868 --> 06:20:23.878 align:start position:0%
director of administrative Services uh
 
06:20:26.910 --> 06:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
and uh a person very familiar with the
 
06:20:28.350 --> 06:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
office of Cost Containment will be
 
06:20:31.670 --> 06:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
testifying after me uh and explaining in
 
06:20:36.430 --> 06:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
more detail uh some uh
 
06:20:38.670 --> 06:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
some things that we might want to add to
 
06:20:43.310 --> 06:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation so that the the end of
 
06:20:45.310 --> 06:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
the office of Cost Containment can
 
06:20:47.868 --> 06:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
happen quickly and as painlessly as
 
06:20:51.110 --> 06:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
possible uh with that I'll take any
 
06:20:53.548 --> 06:20:53.558 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
06:20:56.868 --> 06:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you oh we
 
06:21:00.590 --> 06:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
have one here representative Burch so am
 
06:21:05.270 --> 06:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
I correct in saying two things one
 
06:21:09.948 --> 06:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
that the cost of collection is going up
 
06:21:15.150 --> 06:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
the amount recouped is going down and
 
06:21:18.708 --> 06:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
secondly that the cost of collection is
 
06:21:21.390 --> 06:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
more than is being
 
06:21:25.548 --> 06:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
recouped the second is true the first is
 
06:21:29.270 --> 06:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
not true in this way I think back before
 
06:21:31.590 --> 06:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
the changes were made about five or six
 
06:21:35.948 --> 06:21:35.958 align:start position:0%
years ago the cost of collection was
 
06:21:38.390 --> 06:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
around 600
 
06:21:41.110 --> 06:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
$600,000 the cost of collection is now
 
06:21:43.948 --> 06:21:43.958 align:start position:0%
because there's so much less being
 
06:21:46.708 --> 06:21:46.718 align:start position:0%
collected the the resources you don't
 
06:21:48.750 --> 06:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
need as many resources so the cost of
 
06:21:53.150 --> 06:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
collection has gone down to 380,000 uh
 
06:21:58.350 --> 06:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
this past year but yes the cost of cost
 
06:22:00.708 --> 06:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
the amount collected is less than the
 
06:22:05.270 --> 06:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:06.510 --> 06:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:22:10.468 --> 06:22:10.478 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
06:22:13.548 --> 06:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
you Katherine Keane and Charlie is it
 
06:22:19.150 --> 06:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:21.910 --> 06:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
house like darling was a D in a house on
 
06:22:25.910 --> 06:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
the end um was my grandmother's line uh
 
06:22:27.190 --> 06:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
I'm Charlie Arling housee I'm the
 
06:22:29.468 --> 06:22:29.478 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative Services
 
06:22:30.948 --> 06:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Cassie Keenan the Deputy
 
06:22:34.510 --> 06:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Das um so for the record
 
06:22:35.910 --> 06:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're technically not in favor or
 
06:22:37.070 --> 06:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill I told the
 
06:22:38.910 --> 06:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office because as you
 
06:22:40.548 --> 06:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
probably know I can't testify for or
 
06:22:41.990 --> 06:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
against anything without direct written
 
06:22:44.430 --> 06:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
permission of Major League Baseball um
 
06:22:47.030 --> 06:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're here providing information I will
 
06:22:50.230 --> 06:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
note that our budget as presented in the
 
06:22:52.990 --> 06:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
Govern phase does not include an office
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
of Cost Containment starting on July 1st
 
06:22:59.548 --> 06:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
2026 so you might guess that I can see
 
06:23:03.190 --> 06:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
which way the wind is blowing um
 
06:23:06.628 --> 06:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh just to put it in perspective seven8
 
06:23:09.310 --> 06:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
years ago we collected 2.5 million which
 
06:23:10.910 --> 06:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
goes into the general fund and is in the
 
06:23:12.910 --> 06:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
other line in Revenue this year we'll
 
06:23:14.708 --> 06:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
collect about 300,000 so think of that
 
06:23:18.390 --> 06:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
line is going down and the line of
 
06:23:20.868 --> 06:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
collections has been a little bit bumpy
 
06:23:24.390 --> 06:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
but flattish and it went down a bit uh
 
06:23:26.030 --> 06:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
when those two lines cross it's like in
 
06:23:27.468 --> 06:23:27.478 align:start position:0%
Ghostbusters you're not supposed to
 
06:23:29.628 --> 06:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
cross the lines and so we cross the line
 
06:23:34.628 --> 06:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
so it's time for things to um move on um
 
06:23:36.468 --> 06:23:36.478 align:start position:0%
a couple of thoughts though if if you
 
06:23:38.110 --> 06:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
are going to eliminate the office of
 
06:23:39.948 --> 06:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment the bill has an
 
06:23:42.628 --> 06:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
effective date of January 1st I think it
 
06:23:44.230 --> 06:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
would be sensible to have an effective
 
06:23:47.948 --> 06:23:47.958 align:start position:0%
date upon upon passage um I'm
 
06:23:50.230 --> 06:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the idea of a
 
06:23:53.910 --> 06:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
limbo um where there is a um a period of
 
06:23:56.510 --> 06:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
time where it's been repealed but not
 
06:23:58.628 --> 06:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
effective yet because you're you're
 
06:24:01.868 --> 06:24:01.878 align:start position:0%
Dunning somebody for for $10 a week that
 
06:24:03.708 --> 06:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
he's not going to have to keep paying in
 
06:24:05.868 --> 06:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
about a month or too and it's awkward to
 
06:24:09.910 --> 06:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
say the least um I'm going to suggest to
 
06:24:12.150 --> 06:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
the sponsor language just a sentence
 
06:24:14.030 --> 06:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
along the lines of the commissioner
 
06:24:17.190 --> 06:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
shall be authorized to um take whatever
 
06:24:18.948 --> 06:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable measures to wind the office
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
down as Mak sense um I I would propose
 
06:24:27.868 --> 06:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
that secondly um our our understanding
 
06:24:31.468 --> 06:24:31.478 align:start position:0%
of the bill is that upon passage we
 
06:24:34.830 --> 06:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
should stop collecting we have two kinds
 
06:24:36.670 --> 06:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
of collections one is if a judge happens
 
06:24:38.830 --> 06:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
to assign a new case it doesn't happen
 
06:24:38.840 --> 06:24:39.708 align:start position:0%
to assign a new case it doesn't happen
Much

06:24:39.708 --> 06:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
Much
 
06:24:41.868 --> 06:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
Anymore um but it does happen
 
06:24:43.990 --> 06:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
periodically um the other kind is there
 
06:24:46.548 --> 06:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
are people who are paying $5 a week or
 
06:24:49.350 --> 06:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
something like that a month for and have
 
06:24:52.468 --> 06:24:52.478 align:start position:0%
been for years and and they continue to
 
06:24:55.390 --> 06:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
pay our presumption is that when this is
 
06:24:57.948 --> 06:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
repealed everybody stops paying and
 
06:24:59.510 --> 06:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
which I think is reasonable and fair and
 
06:25:01.830 --> 06:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
helps the state avoid lawsuits and so I
 
06:25:03.510 --> 06:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
so I would tell you that that is Our
 
06:25:05.390 --> 06:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
intention we hope the effective date
 
06:25:09.830 --> 06:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
will be upon passage we hope that um we
 
06:25:11.868 --> 06:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
can have some sort of proformer language
 
06:25:15.990 --> 06:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
about we can take whatever measures um
 
06:25:18.230 --> 06:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
and we hope uh and and we hope our
 
06:25:19.788 --> 06:25:19.798 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct about about
 
06:25:22.390 --> 06:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
that we should stop collecting on on
 
06:25:25.830 --> 06:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
everyone then the fourth thing I would
 
06:25:29.390 --> 06:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
suggest is that we be directed to
 
06:25:31.070 --> 06:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
destroy all the
 
06:25:35.030 --> 06:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
records um I know that sounds weird
 
06:25:36.788 --> 06:25:36.798 align:start position:0%
although if you'd seen the Clutter that
 
06:25:39.270 --> 06:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
is state government where the paper
 
06:25:42.270 --> 06:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
never goes away um it's a good thing but
 
06:25:43.510 --> 06:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
there are records sometimes that we're
 
06:25:45.150 --> 06:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
we're required to keep for like seven
 
06:25:47.788 --> 06:25:47.798 align:start position:0%
years well we're we end a program and
 
06:25:49.468 --> 06:25:49.478 align:start position:0%
we're not really going to go back in six
 
06:25:51.990 --> 06:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
months and say you know what Fred um
 
06:25:53.350 --> 06:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to start collecting from you
 
06:25:55.190 --> 06:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
again I think it would be reasonable to
 
06:25:58.868 --> 06:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
have me um shred everything just to just
 
06:26:02.190 --> 06:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
so it also avoids the possibility of uh
 
06:26:04.830 --> 06:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
of somebody deciding 6 months from now
 
06:26:06.590 --> 06:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know my bad let's start collecting
 
06:26:10.390 --> 06:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
again and that becomes very um
 
06:26:12.910 --> 06:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
awkward actually I think that's about
 
06:26:15.430 --> 06:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
all representative
 
06:26:17.468 --> 06:26:17.478 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair thank
 
06:26:18.708 --> 06:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
you commissioner thank you for being
 
06:26:22.390 --> 06:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
here um on the fiscal note it says um on
 
06:26:23.750 --> 06:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
the second page due to previous
 
06:26:25.830 --> 06:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
legislative changes collections have
 
06:26:28.510 --> 06:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
declined significantly can you touch
 
06:26:30.030 --> 06:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
upon that and
 
06:26:32.510 --> 06:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
why why those changes resulted in a
 
06:26:35.270 --> 06:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
decline in in um
 
06:26:38.030 --> 06:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue so the the two changes and and
 
06:26:40.110 --> 06:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
representative sure outlined them um a
 
06:26:42.270 --> 06:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
little bit I think the two changes the
 
06:26:45.468 --> 06:26:45.478 align:start position:0%
the the one is that we used to do the
 
06:26:48.910 --> 06:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
determination um uh our our staff would
 
06:26:50.430 --> 06:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
would go in and meet and do a
 
06:26:52.430 --> 06:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
determination and and the presumption
 
06:26:54.510 --> 06:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
was uh something along the lines of you
 
06:26:56.708 --> 06:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
can't pay today but you know when you
 
06:26:59.868 --> 06:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
get a job you can pay and we would tend
 
06:27:01.548 --> 06:27:01.558 align:start position:0%
to collect from more people the second
 
06:27:03.548 --> 06:27:03.558 align:start position:0%
is now you can only collect if they were
 
06:27:05.110 --> 06:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
found guilty
 
06:27:06.670 --> 06:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
which is a small fraction of cases so
 
06:27:08.590 --> 06:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
we're collecting on many many many fewer
 
06:27:12.190 --> 06:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
cases and and judges you know we
 
06:27:13.948 --> 06:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
operated on the presumption I think
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
along the lines of our job is to figure
 
06:27:18.270 --> 06:27:18.280 align:start position:0%
out a way to recoup something and I
 
06:27:19.708 --> 06:27:19.718 align:start position:0%
think the judges probably have a
 
06:27:21.788 --> 06:27:21.798 align:start position:0%
slightly different perspective but it's
 
06:27:23.628 --> 06:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
declined I would say this to you every
 
06:27:26.230 --> 06:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
monthly collection this is something I
 
06:27:28.910 --> 06:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
look at has been lower than the same
 
06:27:31.788 --> 06:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
month the prior year for four straight
 
06:27:34.750 --> 06:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
years maybe five actually now
 
06:27:36.830 --> 06:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
in in this is the fifth fiscal year
 
06:27:39.430 --> 06:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing that so there's a it's going
 
06:27:41.948 --> 06:27:41.958 align:start position:0%
down and and if you don't repeal it it
 
06:27:48.830 --> 06:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:52.390 --> 06:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
Smith commissioner I I think you said if
 
06:27:53.750 --> 06:27:53.760 align:start position:0%

06:27:59.548 --> 06:27:59.558 align:start position:0%
