00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
had some questions i um
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
i asked
 
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we need to have more information
 
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.110 align:start position:0%
that we need to have more information
before

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
this is because i'm not sure that this
 
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%
is the proper way to do it and um i
 
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
think that dhhs needs to have some
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
feedback um
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
or to us about the normal process of
 
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.830 align:start position:0%
or to us about the normal process of
this

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
if it's appropriate because i i believe
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
that they probably set this rate
 
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.670 align:start position:0%
that they probably set this rate
themselves

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
and um through rules
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know we can have discussion about
 
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate and needs to be amended but
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh it should go through that rules
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
creating process is my first thought
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
about it and without additional
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
information i i think that that
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
right and i and i agree while the bill
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
is very well intended first of all this
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
is not a budget year so
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
dcyf would have to pull this money out
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
of their existing budget for what the
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
state has to cover
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i think it amounts to 40 cents
 
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.950 align:start position:0%
and i think it amounts to 40 cents
so

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.830 align:start position:0%
so
i

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.950 align:start position:0%
i
right

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
good good intention but
 
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
i think there's a different procedure
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
that this needs to go through
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
my thoughts exactly yeah i think it
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
should be brought back during a budget
 
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
year it's it's
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
important enough to do that
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead josh i'm not sure that it
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
should be brought back i think it may
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
just be going through the wrong process
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
if they if we reached out to dhhs and
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
said hey what's going on
 
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.189 align:start position:0%
said hey what's going on
um

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
is this appropriate they may have
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
information that yes this is appropriate
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
and you know you know based on other
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
states or how like you know more
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
information than we got at the hearing
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
and and say no we're we we're not um
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh supporting a change or an increase or
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
we are supporting a change and it's not
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
happening because x y and z and maybe we
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
can help in those impediments but
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure that this like kind of a
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
reach around
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
control like into their spaces
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
without their input is is the best
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
best avenue right
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%

you um so this amendment is
um

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
kind of uh one of the things that was
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
brought up at the hearing
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
um or
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the language of the bill um it said
 
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
in the language of the bill um it said
that

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
in certain situations the gal can kind
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
of recommend
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
what they think should happen to the
 
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.350 align:start position:0%
what they think should happen to the
judge

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
and that's really not the role of the
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
gal the gal is a fact-finding
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
arm of the
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
judge and not
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
their advisor
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
um this
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
this uh the
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
amendment will replace the
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
the um existing language and will
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill and we'll just amend that
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
the report from the gal shall include
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
only factual information and shall not
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
propose any recommendations
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
because if you recall that was a lot of
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
the complaints that we heard was that
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
there were just a lot of recommendations
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
being made and i will tell you a few
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
years ago representative long and i were
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
on a study committee and it was my
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
we had removed
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
the recommendations
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
part already and then to my surprise i
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
looked it up and apparently didn't
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
follow the bill enough to see that it
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
included three exceptions
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
so what the amendment does is just
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
removes those three exceptions it's not
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
getting rid of gals
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
but hopefully this will create a little
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
less conflict
 
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
less conflict
and

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
we will speak
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
i mean we will
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
vote on adopting amendment
 
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:57.990 align:start position:0%
vote on adopting amendment

1531

00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
modifies the oversight commission on
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
children's services so um
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
can you make who's making that motion
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
about that i'm going to move out to pass
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
please second second
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
i have an amendment
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
that i'll pass out and it has senator
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
carson's name on it
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
but i have one in ols i i mean i had
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
them put it in my name so if we adopt it
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
it'll come out
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
um like that but so what this does
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
it repeals the entire bill the it
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire bill
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
and it just repeals
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
the commission to study grand families
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
and the commission to review child abuse
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
fatalities and i will tell you why that
 
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.389 align:start position:0%
fatalities and i will tell you why that
is

00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
because we are going to combine
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
those two commissions
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
into the oversight commission on
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
children's services
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
this was senator whitley
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting on friday and this is
 
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.949 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting on friday and this is
um

00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
what she requested that we do and she is
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and then when it gets to the senate and
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
we're done hearing from the members as
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
to which roles
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
will be played senator carson is going
 
00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:14.310 align:start position:0%
will be played senator carson is going
to

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
amend it to add those
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
roles the the further members that are
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
needed so to speak for pulling from both
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
of those commissions so that it's all
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
under one and we don't have
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
people trying to be in three places at
 
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.189 align:start position:0%
people trying to be in three places at
once

00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
the director ribsum trying to run
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
everywhere and so this is this is one
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
thing that and i'll be honest when i
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored it it was my intent that
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill would do
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's what i thought it was going to do
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
but when it came before us it was very
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
confusing and stuff so in talking with
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
senator whitley senator carson um
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
who else was there
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
now i can't remember but this is what we
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
came up
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
with okay so do you have a question
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
just a comment oh sure
 
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.470 align:start position:0%
just a comment oh sure
um

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
i i was talking with um
 
00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:14.949 align:start position:0%
i i was talking with um
the

00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:16.390 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
child advocate after that hearing and it
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
did seem that there was a lot of
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
duplication that she was having to go
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
and say the same things to a bunch of
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
different commissions and so i think
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
that um this is a good idea to try and
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
combine some of those so that it will
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
take some load off of her in
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
in not
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
getting less information out just
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
getting it more directly and not having
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
to duplicate
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
so exactly thanks exactly
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
is there any other
 
00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:50.230 align:start position:0%
is there any other
um

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
questions or comments
 
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.270 align:start position:0%
questions or comments
discussion

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
so when the clerk's ready i'll i'll have
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
him call the roll for amendment
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
let me make sure that's the right number
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
on this hold on they may have changed
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
well it's in it's in senator carson's
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
name so we can't
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
so it's 0 5 9 7 h
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
oh really yeah because it can't be it
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
can't be in senator carson's name it's a
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.789 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
introduce an amendment
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
which is coming around
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um so
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
basically when we heard testimony from
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
from many of these people
 
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.149 align:start position:0%
from many of these people
uh

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we wanted to
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
amend this to was to require a database
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
as to the reason why
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
the family court rules were being waived
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
what it does is
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
essentially if a judge waves a court
 
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.190 align:start position:0%
essentially if a judge waves a court
rule

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
they have to explain why
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
there is a database and requires the
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to provide that database
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
to the chair of this committee the chair
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
of senate judiciary and
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
the senate president and the speaker of
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can kind of have an idea of
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
where this goes and i hope that we can
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
support this amendment
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
um i would just like to say when when
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
discussing this amendment that
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
you know we get quarterly reports from
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
um director ribsum
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
um we get quarterly reports from the
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate so i don't
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
think it's unreasonable
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
to request a quarter quarterly report so
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
we can see if there's trends somewhere
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
if there are any changes that maybe we
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
need to make
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
and we can't do that without the
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
information so i think this will give us
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
good information
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
definitely good representative long they
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
can take it madam chair so
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
currently we don't receive any data
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
because they're not keeping the data so
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
this amendment requires them to keep the
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
data and report to us quarterly
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
yes right okay great thank you
 
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
yes right okay great thank you
okay

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion oh representative
 
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.990 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion oh representative
alt-shiller

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at this legislation and it
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
says it takes effect
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
60 days after passage
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
which i don't
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know that uh
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that i don't know that
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
anyone can put a can formulate
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure for a database
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
to be in operation within 60 days is
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
that it seems that seems like for
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't exist we're not
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
asking to
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
reform a database that exists we're
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
asking to
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
asking them to come up with an entirely
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
new system which i don't disagree we
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
should i
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
i am in favor of the
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
nature of this bill and of all the
 
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
nature of this bill and of all the
things

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm worried about the 60 days of
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
passage not being an adequate amount of
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
time to build what we really need
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
okay so let me ask richard head who
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
happens to be sitting in the audience
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
if we have a
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.320 --> 00:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
i mean we're just really looking for
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
names in the
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
reasons we don't i mean not names but
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
the rule that was waived why
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
yeah number line 13 it says the number
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
the the rule wave by number the title
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
the party in whose favor the rule was
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
raised so we wouldn't want a name just
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
just the defendant versus the right the
 
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.990 align:start position:0%
just the defendant versus the right the
um

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
plaintiff right
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you madam chair so i'm
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
wondering it's public information
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
anyways isn't that the name yeah of the
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the parties of the of the case yeah
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
it is that's right public information so
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't matter oh it's not no it's
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
not well
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
no mr head's shaking his head yeah no
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
not all i've got because there are some
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
that they don't put it out there
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
especially in domestic violence cases
 
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:56.070 align:start position:0%
especially in domestic violence cases
correct

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
i mean do we have to specifically say
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
plaintiff versus defendant
 
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.789 align:start position:0%
plaintiff versus defendant
or

00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
but do we have to clarify that in the
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
amendment do you think
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that uh survivors of
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and um i agree family
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
court that has um trafficking involved
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
with it um particularly familial
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
trafficking that this information which
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
is under seal and enclosed courtrooms
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
will now be
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's a long list of people who would
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
have access to that and it's
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think i don't believe there
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
should be any names no case numbers
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
we just want to know
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
why it was waived
 
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.510 align:start position:0%
why it was waived
and

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
whether it was the petitioner or the
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
um what's the other one
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
respondent thank you
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time okay so can that
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
go into the amendment that it clarifies
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
as petitioner and respondent
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
so just instead of the party whose
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
favorite was world like um and whether
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
it was the defendant or respondent who
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to submit the amendment but i
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
was trying to email
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
the other minute and wasn't paying
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
attention fully so if somebody could

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
at the end and the plaintiff or
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
defendant whose favor the rule was
 
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.549 align:start position:0%
defendant whose favor the rule was
waived

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
waived
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%

00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%

whether it's the pointer for the
 
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.110 align:start position:0%
whether it's the pointer for the
defendant

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%

us you know uh you do think it is
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
so because we're not gonna know if it's
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
male or female we're not there's not
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
gonna be any identifying factors other
 
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.789 align:start position:0%
gonna be any identifying factors other
than

00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
they were the plaintiff
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
long's point i i i see kind of where

you're

00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
iffy on the the fact but i think what's
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
important if we're providing if the
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is providing
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
a report on
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
the court rules we want to know
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know was that court rule in favor of
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
person a or was it in favor of person b
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important to know that
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
information so that if there is a trend
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
we can you know the chair can
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
ask those questions and go okay what's
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
going on here
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
um i think it's important piece
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative yokela i think in
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
individual in
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
um the idea is
 
00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.190 align:start position:0%
um the idea is
in

00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
a specific case or a specific rule it's
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
not that valuable but when you aggregate
 
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.870 align:start position:0%
not that valuable but when you aggregate
it

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
over a number of cases it should be
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
about 50 50
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
that it's going one way versus another
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
if it was 75 percent the defendants then
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
really weird um that always get the
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
rules waived and so um just as a
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
statistical thing to make sure that
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
nothing um
 
00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:28.789 align:start position:0%
nothing um
is

00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:29.590 align:start position:0%
is
uh

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
untoward i guess okay representative all
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
chiller thank you madam chair um
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
if i recall from the notes i took during
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
the the testimony um and some of the
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
questions that were coming here out of
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh the the issue was um
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
why why rules were being waived
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
which rules were being waived and for
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
what reason those rules were being
 
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.950 align:start position:0%
what reason those rules were being
waived

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
waived
 
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.669 align:start position:0%
waived
we

00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
and perhaps this is my interpretation
 
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.029 align:start position:0%
and perhaps this is my interpretation
but

00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
we heard from a lot of um
 
00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:10.470 align:start position:0%
we heard from a lot of um
plaintiffs

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
complaints about
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
court rules being waived
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think that i personally i
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
thought that our focus and the reason we
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to do this was to find out if
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
there's an abundance of that we would be
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
able to see like the court heard x
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
number of cases
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
of those x number of cases rules were
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
waived in this percentage of them and of
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
those rules
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
this particular rule seems to be one
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
that gets waved a lot and that was the
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
information we were looking for yeah not
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not necessarily trying to
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
that we were looking for
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
um a scale of
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
which side was being
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
um was being favored or not favored
 
00:34:58.079 --> 00:34:59.750 align:start position:0%
um was being favored or not favored
because

00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
well everyone all of those courses are
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
in family court they're all unique
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
however the the rules that are being
 
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.670 align:start position:0%
however the the rules that are being
waived

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
waived
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then create a further uniqueness and
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
so what that's what i thought that's
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
what we were looking for is what rules
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
seem to always be on the table for
 
00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:20.230 align:start position:0%
seem to always be on the table for
change

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
change
okay

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you uh also on
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
line 17 it says um the case by name and
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
number so that oh yeah
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be omitted yeah we can't
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
have the case by name and number
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
i'll have it stricken yeah
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
a case can be identified by
 
00:35:53.839 --> 00:35:56.230 align:start position:0%
a case can be identified by
um

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.270 align:start position:0%
um
if

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
you know by saying whether it was the uh
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
responder or
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know identifying that i think that
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
with all the um cases they hear area i
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
think somebody would have to be really
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
really good
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean representative
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
yokela yes um i think that if the if the
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
case was um heard in open court then um
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
obviously the anyone that was there or
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
would be able to know
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
firsthand what it was if it wasn't an
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
open court then there's no way that the
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
people not there are going to be able to
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
track one to one
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
you know and so um also
 
00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:43.589 align:start position:0%
you know and so um also
um

00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was brought up in
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
those hearings was um
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
a concern that there was repetitive
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
motions being made
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
by a single party
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this
 
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.470 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this
would

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
would help with that
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
but we may be able to see if multiple
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh examples
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
were waived for a single
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
case that would be
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
um unusual
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
and and something that we might want to
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
look into further
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
versus you know they're scattered one
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
rule you know doesn't apply versus one
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
case that has you know 15 rules that god
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
got waived and
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
and the person obviously the defendant
 
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
and the person obviously the defendant
or

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
the person the responding is
 
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.109 align:start position:0%
the person the responding is
um

00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.390 align:start position:0%
um
or

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's hard for them to know what what to
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
expect if all the rules are just getting
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
thrown out right and so that's that's
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
something that i would be interested in
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
also so thank you
 
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.349 align:start position:0%
also so thank you
okay

00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
but i do agree that we do need to remove
 
00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.109 align:start position:0%
but i do agree that we do need to remove
um

00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
the case by name and number
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
in which the rule was waived
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
man i'm sure
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes i'm currently writing that email now
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
hey before i
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
yeah let's hold off one second to make
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
sure there's nothing else we need to
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.150 align:start position:0%
oh
yes

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
i saw that and i'm gonna fix it anyway
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative yokela so
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
as as i was trying to allude to in my
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
last name and um i don't really care
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
about the case number but i would like
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
some way to identify that you know it's
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
all regarding the same case versus you
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
know all spread out between different
 
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.950 align:start position:0%
know all spread out between different
cases

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
i just don't know how it could be that
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
i mean just any
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
you could say like you know
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
case one we did blah blah blah case two
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
we wave this rule case three we waived
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
seventeen rules case four so you it
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter which then is that
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
you want
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
for each case
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
i mean i want it to be able to be tied
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
back yeah to so that
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
i that we would be able to know if
 
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.670 align:start position:0%
i that we would be able to know if
there's

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
i just don't know how we do that without
 
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.069 align:start position:0%
i just don't know how we do that without
identifying

00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
the people because the case number
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
anyone can go and look up and we don't
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
want to leave
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
put anyone in jeopardy
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
right i mean i know that my case and my
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
information was sealed in my
 
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.870 align:start position:0%
information was sealed in my
um

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
case because
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
the man tried to kill me
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
so and went to jail they didn't want him
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
to ever know where i was
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put anybody
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
in that situation because it's really
 
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.670 align:start position:0%
in that situation because it's really
scary

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
scary
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
so do you know what i mean go ahead
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
so as i was stating i don't think that
 
00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
so as i was stating i don't think that
that

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
the specific case number
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
or is of value to this committee it's
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's knowing that
 
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.589 align:start position:0%
it's knowing that
um

00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
you just want each case anonymized way
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
of saying hey being anonymous
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
and all the rules that were waived for
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
case one say so to speak right all the
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
rules that were
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
so that we so that
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
um it so how do we put that in writing
 
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.829 align:start position:0%
um it so how do we put that in writing
in

00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
here mister head do you have any
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:08.790 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative simone
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm thinking that
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
if we were to use a particular date
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then case one two three four five
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
that would help i mean
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
however but he's got to look at it
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
through the database
 
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.950 align:start position:0%
through the database
right

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.030 align:start position:0%
right
okay

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
is he going to find
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
information or just go next okay that's
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
fine yeah so
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
i mean if i can yep um i don't think
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
that this is like
 
00:41:52.319 --> 00:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
that this is like
the

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
most important issue and i'm not sure
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be solved with this
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
amendment we we can you know talk with
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
mr head and and draft some some language
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
that works with them um in and and
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
propose that in the senate it's not
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be all solved today
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
right okay representative altschiller
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so um
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
the the issue that we're struggling with
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
right now is safety for um
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
the people who are involved in these
 
00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.870 align:start position:0%
the people who are involved in these
cases

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
and how do we keep them safe um and
 
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.829 align:start position:0%
and how do we keep them safe um and
and

00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:28.839 --> 00:42:30.390 align:start position:0%
and
also

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
gather that information and so instead
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
of asking the courts to
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
come up with another identification
 
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
come up with another identification
system

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
with you know
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
passcodes and so on and so forth
 
00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
passcodes and so on and so forth
would

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
would the committee be open to
 
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.150 align:start position:0%
would the committee be open to
um

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
in section
 
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.630 align:start position:0%
in section
three

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry in section four the
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
quarterly report you mean roman numeral
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
for roman numeral four thank you
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
roman numeral four that the quarterly
 
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.510 align:start position:0%
roman numeral four that the quarterly
report

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.790 align:start position:0%
report
um

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
and also roman numeral three that
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
when we when
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
people outside of the court system have
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
access which is a lot of people
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
that those case numbers be redacted is
 
00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:28.390 align:start position:0%
that those case numbers be redacted is
that

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
does that get us to where we want to go
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
do you see what she's saying
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
yes i see what she's saying um but
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
redacted just means like a black line
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
covering over it so that's not going to
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
give us case one click case two no it
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
would be every case the rules that were
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
waived under that case number would be
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
with it but the case number would
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
actually be redacted when it comes out
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
to the reports to the people so
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
yeah if that can be done and that yeah
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
you know we i think the well it can be
 
00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:03.829 align:start position:0%
you know we i think the well it can be
done

00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
no i mean if if it is
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
not um overly burdensome for that
 
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.470 align:start position:0%
not um overly burdensome for that
um

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
to be implemented by the
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
the um judicial branch i am not opposed
 
00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:18.790 align:start position:0%
the um judicial branch i am not opposed
to

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
um a myriad of different ways that they
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
they could get this that us the
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
information so i think that it's best
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
if we kind of like table that idea of
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
by case
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i could reach out to
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh mr head and
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
um between now and in the senate we can
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
get some feedback on that to try and
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
address that specific issue but right
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
now if you didn't have any case numbers
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
in this bill that would be fine with
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
miata and then we can address that um
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
getting it grouped by a case
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
number in the senate when when the
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
judicial branch has had time to see what
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
best work is easiest for their i.t
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know department yeah representative
 
00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:06.790 align:start position:0%
you know department yeah representative
belanger

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
belanger
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
so are we changing this any further than
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
the two changes
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
that we've already addressed three
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
changes the well i've already sent that
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
email so i apologize okay
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative long yeah i think yep
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm fine with the three changes the
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
start date
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
the uh redacting the two
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
initial um the real wave binary and
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh no wait wait the rule waived by name
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
and title
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
is actually the name of the rule
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
no no no on line 18
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
the case by name and number and then the
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
party whose favor
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
part 17 num line 17 the case by name and
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
number those right that's actually we're
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
taking that right you're taking that out
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
and then 18 the party in whose favor the
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
rule was waived to put defendant or
 
00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:02.870 align:start position:0%
rule was waived to put defendant or
right

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then the uh
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
the effective date let's see right okay
 
00:46:08.319 --> 00:46:09.430 align:start position:0%
the effective date let's see right okay
and

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
so do you do you see that representative
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
belanger what we're talking about
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
yes miss uh madam chair so i just was
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
before representative long um
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
jumped in and to clarify that um i have
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
rewritten it and i want to clarify how
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
it sounds before i send off this email
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
so on line 13
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
i said please allow for this to be
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
written um title the reason for which
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
the rule was waived
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
comma and who the waiver favored by
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
identifying if it was the plaintiff or
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
the defendant is that sufficient for
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
it is yeah
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and then
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
the wording that you just read um sorry
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't fast enough to write it down the
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're currently
 
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.710 align:start position:0%
we're currently
saying

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
asking for who
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
um requested the waiver essentially
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're saying the defendant requested the
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
waiver it was granted
 
00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.950 align:start position:0%
waiver it was granted
um

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
or the the plaintiff requested the
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
waiver and the way that that you phrased
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
it it sound like we are now
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
under that language would be collecting
 
00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.510 align:start position:0%
under that language would be collecting
who

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.390 align:start position:0%
who
was

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
who the plaintiff the other one
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
the person that was affected by the
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
waiver and not the person that requested
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
the waiver is that um can you re-read it
 
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.750 align:start position:0%
the waiver is that um can you re-read it
or

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
or answer to who is affected was it the
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
respondent or the
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
or was it the plaintiff or the defendant
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
that requested the waiver sure so the
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
way that i have written it says the
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
reason for which the rule was waived and
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
who the waiver favored by identifying if
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
it was the plaintiff or the defendant
 
00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:01.589 align:start position:0%
it was the plaintiff or the defendant
so

00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
yeah there was testimony um
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
where the judge will wave it without
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
even a request
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
the judge will just say uh okay you had
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
10 days to get this in it's the 13th day
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
i'm waving at
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
and and the person didn't even request
 
00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:20.309 align:start position:0%
and and the person didn't even request
it

00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:48:20.319 --> 00:48:21.750 align:start position:0%
it
right

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.150 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
who who who who it favored
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i think who it favored is is
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
good enough
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i think who it favored is good
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
for defendant
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
what if the
 
00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:39.270 align:start position:0%
what if the
the

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
judge believed that it favored both
 
00:48:41.359 --> 00:48:42.309 align:start position:0%
judge believed that it favored both
parties

00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
then he can say both okay who cares
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
right he can say
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure yes
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
and then to fix representative alt
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
schiller's concerns regarding represent
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
lines 17-19 i have it written as referee

waived that has been stricken
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
and then continues the party
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
if the waiver was ruled in favor of the
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
plaintiff or the defendant the rule wave
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%

00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
which the rule was waived
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
is that sufficient yes
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%

can i just read that back to you
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
starting on 17
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
referee who waved the rule comma
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
which rule was waived
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%

00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
the party okay
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
the party in whose favor the rule was
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
waived rewritten as the party if the
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
waiver was ruled in favor of the
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
the party comma or the party if
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
you already stayed in the first change
 
00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:29.670 align:start position:0%
you already stayed in the first change
right

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
so that's duplicate i'm just
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
i mean it is duplicated in multiple
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
locations on the bill but but if i'm i'm
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
just i'm thinking about like the
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
chronology of how
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
the where the chronology of how this
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
who or referee who waved the rule that
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
would be first so the person who did it
 
00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:52.710 align:start position:0%
would be first so the person who did it
second

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
which rule did they waive
 
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.870 align:start position:0%
which rule did they waive
third

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
what is the name and title of that rule
 
00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
what is the name and title of that rule
fourth

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
the cause for which the rule was waived
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%

00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
i'm certain we won't agree on everything
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
but the best thing about this is we just
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
do it so respectfully with each other
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
and i really appreciate that because
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
there have been moments this morning
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
included i'm just like saying i'm done
 
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.589 align:start position:0%
included i'm just like saying i'm done
so

00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
you guys have all restored some of my
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
faith in this
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
so while we're waiting on that there's
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
no more discussion on that i'm going
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's more discussion
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
no i was just um
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
being that it's 9 50 it would be maybe
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
we could um
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're done with the
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
discussion we could take a break and and
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
have that language completely drafted
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
and then we could come back and maybe a
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
recess of like 20 minutes yes how about
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
we do that a recess of 20 minutes
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
and then we will be back here at 10
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
minutes past
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
10. i'm not going to be back here at 10
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
minutes past 10 why not
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's 20 minutes
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
20 minutes would be 10 minutes can we
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
can we do 10 o'clock madam chair no it
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
has to be 10 10 okay or or 10 15 i mean
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
give them time to write the the
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
amendment he has to do something
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine so 10 15 we'll be back
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
everyone okay
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
is that okay yes right before we leave
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
can can uh representative bollinger read
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
that out loud and make sure we're all
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.559 --> 00:53:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
really

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
so all right so let's all right let's
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
just say if it's not let's come back at
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
10 15 if it's not ready we'll move on to
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
the next one
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
so we're back from recess
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
and we're going to pick up where we left
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
off we were waiting for an amendment to
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh what bill
 
01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.430 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh what bill
1265

01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
1265
 
01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:11.430 align:start position:0%
1265
yes

01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
all right and he has it back and all the
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
changes have been made i think christina
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
just ran up to get us copies
 
01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
that way we can all look over over it
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
and then we can
 
01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:27.669 align:start position:0%
and then we can
hopefully

01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
make a boat
 
01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
make a boat
happen

01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
and hopefully representative yokela will
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
all right so we can all take a minute
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
and look through
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
but up top
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
it states
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
who the
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
who the waiver favored by identifying if
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
it was the plaintiff or defendant
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that kind of clears the way
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
and so you see the new amendment number
 
01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:08.870 align:start position:0%
and so you see the new amendment number
correct

01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative belanger make a motion to
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%

are you voting on the amendment
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we have to vote on the amendment
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%

01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
all right which one is okay i'm going to
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
do 1465 next so we can start
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
then we will move on to house bill 1465
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative long do you have a motion
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
i do thank you madam chair
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'll move uh
 
01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
i'll move uh
amendment

01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
but don't we have to have a motion first
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
a move otp ought to pass on 1465.
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll second it
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna we didn't have this
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
amendment before so i just think it's
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
fair to let
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure representative long gets us
 
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
1465. i passed them i passed them out
 
01:49:37.119 --> 01:49:42.470 align:start position:0%
1465. i passed them i passed them out
earlier

01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.480 --> 01:50:06.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.159 --> 01:50:29.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
now you can introduce your amendment and
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak to it
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
sure thank you madam chair i'll uh i'll
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
and if i could explain it yeah please do
 
01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:51.189 align:start position:0%
and if i could explain it yeah please do
so

01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
so this uh uh details a little better
 
01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:55.750 align:start position:0%
so this uh uh details a little better
the

01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
two issues one was we wanted to assure
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
that the appointed attorney
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't representing the
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't representing the um the juvenile
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
in other matters such as civil
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
civil case or or what have you
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
um however the attorney would be
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
interested in that case ought to be
 
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.030 align:start position:0%
interested in that case ought to be
there

01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
um because it has something to do with
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
the juvenile and that'll that that was
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
the death that was the
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh one of the one of the uh issues that
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
came up during the hearing
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
and then the the other change is uh use
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
statement or confession from them from a
 
01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:37.990 align:start position:0%
statement or confession from them from a
minor

01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
minor
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
it articulates better the uh you know it
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
it articulates better where
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
there there can be an interrogation if
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
the child's arrested
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
feels compelled
 
01:51:55.599 --> 01:51:56.709 align:start position:0%
feels compelled
to

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
either divulge information or
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
say a confession
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh it adds that a reasonable per a
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable person thinking that the cha
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the juvenile may have been in that
 
01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:09.350 align:start position:0%
that the juvenile may have been in that
situation

01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh then the attorney would have had to
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
have been present for that situation so
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the cases of an arrest the attorney's
 
01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:17.109 align:start position:0%
in the cases of an arrest the attorney's
there

01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
because that attorney is appointed right
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
away however it's um
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know if they're if police are just
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
questioning the juvenile or whomever uh
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
you know uh principal in school or
 
01:52:29.199 --> 01:52:30.870 align:start position:0%
you know uh principal in school or
whomever

01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
whomever
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's questioning the juvenile
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
a reasonable person being them
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
thinks that the child may have been
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to get out of something so i'm
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
gonna tell you a lie i'm gonna give you
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
a confession or what have you
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
um so that that's what this amendment uh
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
those are the two effects that this
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay um further discussion
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative ocala
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for recognizing me
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
so as far as the um
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
i i definitely like this new language a
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
lot better as far as i was just thinking
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
about the situation let's say there is
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
um a kid is at school they're not free
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
to leave the school right and so they
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
could feel that they're not able to
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
leave and maybe there's um
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
a police officer there that's
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's helping be the you know school
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
officer and the the kid confesses to the
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
police the to the to the um
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh teacher they're not working in
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
conjunction with
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
the um police trying to interrogate the
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
person and so that makes a lot more
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
sense that this
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
that the conjunction with law
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement language is in there and so
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm definitely a lot more um
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
satisfied with this this language thank
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think this i think that this
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
makes it much better and i think it
 
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%

01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
so the amendment just
 
01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:42.149 align:start position:0%
so the amendment just
addresses

01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:57:42.159 --> 01:57:44.149 align:start position:0%
addresses
1a

01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
1a
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
which is um
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
on line 13 on the first page
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the original bill right and then uh
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
section two with the statement of
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
confession of a minor
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
21.

01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
21.
 
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
21.
so

01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
there was one thing i believe that
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
richard had brought up um
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
night weekends and holidays are not
 
01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:16.229 align:start position:0%
night weekends and holidays are not
available

01:58:16.229 --> 01:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
was that for
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
in the original bill in
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 3
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
lines 11-14
 
01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:26.149 align:start position:0%
lines 11-14
for

01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
the court shall follow the procedures
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
under and if appointment is made
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
promptly notify the minor and appointed
 
01:58:32.639 --> 01:58:33.669 align:start position:0%
promptly notify the minor and appointed
counsel

01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that they that meant that
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't have
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to appoint counsel
 
01:58:41.679 --> 01:58:42.950 align:start position:0%
the ability to appoint counsel
on

01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh nights weekends or holidays
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay where was this do you uh
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah because i i wrote it down and
 
01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:54.870 align:start position:0%
yeah because i i wrote it down and
highlighted

01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
um section three
 
01:59:08.229 --> 01:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
i write stuff down and highlight it like
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna remember it when it's
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
time for me to be here
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
i should know better by now
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so so it says that um upon receipt
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
of such petition
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
the court shall follow the procedure so
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to file a petition
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
if it was saturday or
 
01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:30.390 align:start position:0%
if it was saturday or
sunday

01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
sunday
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
right and so they're not going to get it
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
would be your communication requirement
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't get a
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
a lawyer until the
 
01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:43.430 align:start position:0%
a lawyer until the
until

01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:44.390 align:start position:0%
until
monday

01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
monday
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
until the petition was filed in court
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
which is closed saturday and sunday so
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
we're okay with that are we okay with
 
01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:51.750 align:start position:0%
we're okay with that are we okay with
that

01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
i mean they're not going to hold the
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
child right are they going to hold the
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
child in
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
detain them without attorney that
 
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
right because the the point of this bill
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
is that they can get an attorney as soon
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
as essentially they are
 
02:00:10.159 --> 02:00:11.430 align:start position:0%
as essentially they are
detained

02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
detained
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
essentially right
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
and where's putting them in jail and
 
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
still not getting them the attorney
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
because it's a weekend yeah that's what
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's yeah i don't i don't know if it's
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the intent is when
 
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
they're detained
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
it's when there's a petition filed
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
it is when there will be an
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
attorney appointed not
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
not when the child gets stopped for
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
throwing something out the window or
 
02:00:37.199 --> 02:00:38.709 align:start position:0%
throwing something out the window or
whatever

02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
in his car it's when it's when a
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
petition is filed
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%

this
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill would be doing is saying that we're
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%

this
 
02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:06.709 align:start position:0%
this
um

02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
rsa says absent a valid waiver which
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
this will negate
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
the court shall appoint council at the

so
 
02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anything about you know
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%

thank you so um
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
my issue with uh
 
02:05:40.639 --> 02:05:41.510 align:start position:0%
my issue with uh
the

02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:44.709 --> 02:05:44.719 align:start position:0%
original bill my my bill uh or this
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces the entire bill my
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
problem with the original bill is that
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
that there was some things that didn't
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
really even have to do with a court that
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
it was studying
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
and it just um
 
02:06:04.350 --> 02:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:06.149 align:start position:0%
 
re-re-uh

02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
re-re-uh
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
did it with a little bit less
 
02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:11.430 align:start position:0%
did it with a little bit less
people

02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the number of people that
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
would be on the commission um just
 
02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:17.750 align:start position:0%
would be on the commission um just
reducing

02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
like the domestic violence one from two
 
02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
people to one and also
 
02:06:23.119 --> 02:06:23.830 align:start position:0%
people to one and also
say

02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
removing the language that said stuff
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
about like or and it
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
or someone interested in the area
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
which was kind of just like we can just
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
appoint whoever we want right um
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
and then um so i gave some new
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
um examples of what the commission would
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
look into
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
those are on lines 26
 
02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:51.830 align:start position:0%
those are on lines 26
to

02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
line seven on the second page
 
02:06:55.679 --> 02:06:57.669 align:start position:0%
line seven on the second page
and

02:06:57.669 --> 02:06:57.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
so it would be
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
um the frequency of equal shared custody
 
02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:03.910 align:start position:0%
um the frequency of equal shared custody
um

02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
kind of like the effects of
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh delayed enforcement
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the child support because we've
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
talked before about how
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
people are not enforcing the child
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
support orders and so how does that
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
affect the families and and negatively
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
affect them and um
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
and then also
 
02:07:23.679 --> 02:07:25.830 align:start position:0%
and then also
potentially

02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:26.870 align:start position:0%
potentially
the

02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
the rules being waived and does that
 
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
cause appeals more often if if we have
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
testimony about that um
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
there is also a discussion about
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
the ability of children to speak to the
 
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
the ability of children to speak to the
um

02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
in their child custody cases
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
is that being allowed right now or
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
should it be allowed and
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
at what ages and maybe they don't
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
do it in open court but
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
in the in the
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh privacy of the chambers so that they
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
are not unduly influenced and is that
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
the proper procedure or you know better
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
understand because there was questions
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the the judge is
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
alone in there with the kid um
 
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:16.079 align:start position:0%
and is that um
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
the appropriate uh
 
02:08:18.079 --> 02:08:19.270 align:start position:0%
the appropriate uh
venue

02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
venue
 
02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
venue
um

02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.390 align:start position:0%
um
also

02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:26.310 align:start position:0%
also
um

02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
just um gals um there was
 
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
some testimony that was brought to us
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
about gals favoring one parent or
 
02:08:36.079 --> 02:08:37.109 align:start position:0%
about gals favoring one parent or
another

02:08:37.109 --> 02:08:37.119 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:08:37.119 --> 02:08:38.950 align:start position:0%
another
um

02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:39.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:40.709 align:start position:0%
and
and

02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
how much time the actual gal is spending
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
with children
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
and then on line six and seven i just
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
said pretty much anything that the
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
commission finds would negatively in
 
02:08:52.639 --> 02:08:53.589 align:start position:0%
commission finds would negatively in
fact

02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
fact
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
impact the outcome that the court does
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
that would negatively impact
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh outcomes for families so it kind of
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
also if someone comes and testifies
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
about something else that is an issue in
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
the family court system that we have the
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look into that and
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
propose a report on that so
 
02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.069 align:start position:0%
propose a report on that so
um

02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
i requested when i asked for this bill
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
to be drafted that that we would have
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
like four years for the commission to
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
work do its work because i'm not sure
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
that um everything would be able to be
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
done in one year but ols
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
did not
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
did not draft it that way so um
 
02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:39.430 align:start position:0%
did not draft it that way so um
my

02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
my belief is that we should really have
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
four years
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then if if it's producing good
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
results then obviously we can have a
 
02:09:50.470 --> 02:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
bill to extend that and if not then um
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
but i would want to uh
 
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
just accept this and then i would
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
propose an amendment in the in the
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
senate to to do the additional years if
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
if the committee is amenable to that
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you the uh thank you for this
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
josh of representative yokela
 
02:10:10.149 --> 02:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
the only thing
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
i have issue and concern with
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
the a minimum of one hour shall be
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
allowed for public testimony this is
 
02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
just going first of all i think it's bad
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
for these people to have to keep opening
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
these wounds
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think that we have agendas for
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
meetings that will be posted
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
and then if the if someone in the public
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
sees that this is something that has
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
affected them they can come
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
and offer input but to
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
like set a minimum time and
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
really concerns me because we're going
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
to hear the same stories over and over
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
and over again we know what's happening
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
right we
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
for the most part we've heard it for
 
02:10:56.159 --> 02:10:57.350 align:start position:0%
for the most part we've heard it for
years

02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
but i just think that by doing this
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
i think is more um
 
02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:05.599 align:start position:0%
it just really
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
concerns me i mean anyone all the
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
publics are all all the meetings are
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
always public right we can publish an
 
02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:12.950 align:start position:0%
always public right we can publish an
agenda

02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if we can get if if the
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
commission would be allowed its own
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
email address
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how that's done i haven't
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
heard of that being done
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
from a for a commission to have their
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
own email address you know what i mean
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
so that that's my only problem with it
 
02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
because nothing can stop the people from
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
coming in and us being able to ask them
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
questions you know they can send us
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
02:11:44.709 --> 02:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um so obviously i use the
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
original bill as a template and the
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
original bill had like three hours
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
as and so i didn't think that was
 
02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable but um i thought um
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
so i reduced it to one i'm not
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the end of the world for in my
 
02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:06.470 align:start position:0%
it's not the end of the world for in my
position

02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
to say like oh this is how um
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
um the committee needs to
 
02:12:16.159 --> 02:12:16.870 align:start position:0%
um the committee needs to
be

02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
we need to have a five hour long
 
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know hearing or whatever but i my
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
concern i guess
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
might be that um if we didn't say you
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
know we're going to be meeting for an
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
hour at least so that you that you that
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
the people that attend would have enough
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
time to speak and not feel rushed and
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know if there's only one person that
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
is coming that they would have enough
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
time to be able to speak and not feel
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
like that's that's um you know uh
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know there's
 
02:12:56.589 --> 02:12:56.599 align:start position:0%
um i know that i was um
 
02:12:59.189 --> 02:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
testifying or
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't know what i was doing i
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
was i was presenting to a commission um
 
02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:06.149 align:start position:0%
was i was presenting to a commission um
or

02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:13:06.159 --> 02:13:07.109 align:start position:0%
or
um

02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
kind of a committee
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:11.350 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
and

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
um had an agenda
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
and they had a time frame in their minds
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
that this
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
hearing was going to happen and um
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
there was people on the agenda that
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
waited for hours that got
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
um the the the um the chair just said
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay now we we wanted to end this around
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
noon so uh
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah everyone on the agenda that haven't
 
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:39.669 align:start position:0%
yeah everyone on the agenda that haven't
got

02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
got to today we're just gonna push it to
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
the next time kind of a thing and um i
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
was on the outside of that just kind of
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
hearing the audience and the there was a
 
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
person in the audience that said this
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
always happens to me because i and like
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'm always at the end of the agenda and
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
they always just push me to the next
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
meeting kind of a thing and so there is
 
02:14:02.079 --> 02:14:03.030 align:start position:0%
meeting kind of a thing and so there is
um

02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:04.069 align:start position:0%
um
in

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
i think there is some value in saying
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
like hey we're gonna be here for an hour
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
you have your opportunity to to um you
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
know speak and if not we're going to be
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
working on
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
this this issue for that hour and so
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
but so so the other part of that though
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
to me would be
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
it says a minimum of one hour so one
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
person because we know
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
how people tell their stories in here
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
could go on for one hour that's just one
 
02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:35.589 align:start position:0%
could go on for one hour that's just one
person

02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think i don't think that
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
um so this says allowed for public
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
testimony i don't think a per person is
 
02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
right but what if i have
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
10 people that i want to speak
 
02:14:55.109 --> 02:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
and it it says like i feel like this
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't leave the chair any
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
leeway to
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
say can we we really need to move this
 
02:15:01.119 --> 02:15:02.229 align:start position:0%
say can we we really need to move this
along

02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
along
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean like when time is
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
getting short
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
things like that i think i think that's
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what i was just trying to say is
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be trying to rush
 
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
people if they
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
if they're trying to uh
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
um explain
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
obviously if it's more than an hour then
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
the the chair is free to say whatever
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
but if there is people that are
 
02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
that have come to testify and they're
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
trying to to say how the criminal
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
justice system and in the family court
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
has has harmed them and you know whether
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
the the chair is allowed five minutes a
 
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
person to speak um and they want to sh
 
02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:45.750 align:start position:0%
person to speak um and they want to sh
uh

02:15:45.750 --> 02:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think that would be prohibited
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
by this this it would it
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
but those
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
they would need to be able to do it at
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
least so you know if it was five minutes
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
per sp speech then at least you know 12
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
people should be able to
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
speak okay
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you madam
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
chair so i i agree with the
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative that
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh because i i serve on some commissions
 
02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:12.310 align:start position:0%
uh because i i serve on some commissions
where

02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
the public is not asked to speak and i
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
serve on some where they will ask them
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
to speak uh however the the uh so
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh monthly publicly noticed hearings to
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity for members of
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
the public to testify and you leave it
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
at that because sometimes you'll get
 
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
the same person every meeting telling
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
you the same thing
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
which the chair has authority saying you
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
know mr x
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
we absolutely understand we heard that
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
next month so is there something
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
different uh so they have that control
 
02:16:45.439 --> 02:16:49.750 align:start position:0%
different uh so they have that control
um

02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
i like the idea that there's public
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
comment on some of these commissions
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's professional or personal so
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we're looking to just
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
like strike that sentence sentence in
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
that is that what you're thinking or i
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
mean and there's also emails that um
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh people normally email like uh
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
they email either the chair
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee right um so there's
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
always that avenue there already
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
um i mean i
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
i was looking at nine period after
 
02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:22.469 align:start position:0%
i was looking at nine period after
testify

02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh the doctor rest okay yeah right
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
because the chairman pretty much has
 
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
that authority to
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's good because we
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
could be having a discussion and we know
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
that someone in the audience
 
02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
has something to offer
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
regarding that subject matter we're
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
right there they can raise their hand
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
and you know we can talk to them but if
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
we set a specific out because you would
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
have to set a specific hour
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
right during the meeting because
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're going to be into
 
02:17:54.469 --> 02:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
something else someone's going to come
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
in late and say but it says
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
right you know you would have to specify
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
the hour on the agenda
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:05.190 align:start position:0%
yeah so
yeah

02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
what you're asking here is that every
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
hour there'll be public testimony for an
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
hour a minimum of an hour so every hour
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's well no every meeting yes an hour
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
of public testimony
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
and you'll get an hour of public
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
testimony sometimes right but it's the
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
same thing right you know yeah i don't i
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
i feel like that that uh amendment is or
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
that change is
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
warranted it's not
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
contrary to the purpose of the bill
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
right so right
 
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
and would you
 
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of interested in what um yeah
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
what representative all shiller has also
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
had had ideas on her amendments
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
because maybe they need to be joined if
 
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
i want to i think
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
many of us here have sat on commissions
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
this one is ambitious this one is very
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
very ambitious and
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
i i i 100 agree with you and i think
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
most of us agree that this is a
 
02:19:10.719 --> 02:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
most of us agree that this is a
unnecessary

02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
dive into the family court system that
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
is that people are struggling with
 
02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:19.349 align:start position:0%
is that people are struggling with
um

02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
how the chair of a commission
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
prescribing a specific amount of public
 
02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:32.070 align:start position:0%
prescribing a specific amount of public
input

02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
input
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
is actually um and you know three hours
 
02:19:35.359 --> 02:19:37.110 align:start position:0%
is actually um and you know three hours
is

02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of public input and um prescribing
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
one hour i i understand the motivation
 
02:19:44.559 --> 02:19:45.349 align:start position:0%
one hour i i understand the motivation
um

02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
there also has to be some consideration
 
02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
made for
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
this coterie of people that we are
 
02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
asking to come together and do this work
 
02:19:58.309 --> 02:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
um on top of because most of every one
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
of them either has a job in social
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
services in the family court system
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
in advocacy or serving here in the house
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
or in the senate um
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
and then we're asking them to spend what
 
02:20:14.309 --> 02:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
could be anywhere from you know five to
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that having to write
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
this report i think that's a large ask
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
an uncompensated large ask
 
02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:27.030 align:start position:0%
an uncompensated large ask
so

02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
would it would there be an appetite in
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
this committee to amend
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
the public input
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
publicly noticed hearings
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
with an opportunity for members of the
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
public to testify
 
02:20:43.439 --> 02:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
public to testify
um

02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.750 --> 02:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
well go ahead okay
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.349 --> 02:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
we learn a lot from about the problems
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
or the issues that people are having
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
from this from the public testimony and
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
so while i think that they would be able
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
to do some work on their own on this
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
issue because of their knowledge of the
 
02:21:23.359 --> 02:21:24.309 align:start position:0%
issue because of their knowledge of the
issue

02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:21:24.319 --> 02:21:25.510 align:start position:0%
issue
um

02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
and their personal knowledge of the
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
issue i think that um
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
the additional perspectives of um not
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
only the public but other um
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
professionals in this age in this field
 
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
that have their own experiences
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
brought to bear on the subject that that
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
is being
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
is important that we
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
have some time in that meeting that they
 
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
can say hey
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
um i heard you guys talking but what
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
about this kind of a thing and not have
 
02:22:03.359 --> 02:22:04.630 align:start position:0%
about this kind of a thing and not have
to

02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
just hear
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
some the commission like try and solve
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
the solute the problem within themselves
 
02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:12.550 align:start position:0%
the solute the problem within themselves
and

02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:14.710 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
not have the
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know depending on the will of the
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
chair have the opportunity to have that
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
um say either a suggestion or
 
02:22:23.439 --> 02:22:24.550 align:start position:0%
um say either a suggestion or
um

02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
concern brought to the
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
to the uh commission so i i think that
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
we should leave
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for at least some public
 
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
set um speaking time
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
and and if i may add that i think it
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
would be really good for
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
two members from the house judiciary
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
committee to hear some of these stories
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know i mean because
 
02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
it isn't just us right we've got the uh
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
the judiciary people a member from the
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
senate could be a member that's not
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
affiliated with
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
these bills i think the more people we
 
02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
educate the better
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean i think it i think
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
it will help going forward
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
when um when you know these these bills
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
come up but i really think it's
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
important for members of the judiciary
 
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:15.030 align:start position:0%
important for members of the judiciary
to

02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
hear some of these bills some of these
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
issues representative long
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair and and i mean
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
all too often i'll sit on a commission
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
where the chair
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
invites a professional
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
and you'll see rank and file people
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
sitting at the commission
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
shaking their head no when this
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
professional is speaking
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh i mean the bottom line is this bill
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
was brought to us by
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
the years of listening to people you
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
know the way we're like wow how do we
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
get our hands around this right you know
 
02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:50.870 align:start position:0%
get our hands around this right you know
so

02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
i you know and again i think the
 
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
chairman will be able to say you know
 
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
mr smith
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
we heard that last month do you have
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
something different
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know that that that can be
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
controlled and
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
all too often on these commissions
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a time frame yeah you
 
02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:10.960 align:start position:0%

02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:11.910 align:start position:0%

like

02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
oh it's one o'clock i gotta be in
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere at 2 30. you know so you know
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
bingo see you next month
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
this commission ought to know if it
 
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
passes this commission ought to know
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be a time
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
constraining a lot of homework
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
um you know a commitment
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
it's not show up and take a vote and go
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
home you know
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a commitment so i i do
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
like the part of um
 
02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:43.830 align:start position:0%
like the part of um
uh

02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
requiring a public comment
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
i i hear you i i agree with you that
 
02:24:52.479 --> 02:24:53.429 align:start position:0%
i i hear you i i agree with you that
there

02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
there is an absolute place for public
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
input and this is why we're even having
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
this discussion because
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
of public outcry
 
02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to find a way to balance
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
the charge of this commission that's so
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
devolve

02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
devolve
 
02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:16.550 align:start position:0%
devolve
into

02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
like what representative rice was saying
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
a place where people are
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
are exercising their frustrations and
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
then there's not time to address and
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
write that report
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
i want to give people a place to
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
to speak like we do here
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
but at the
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
at a commission
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
they have a direction and they have a
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
deadline and they have things they have
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
to accomplish and
 
02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:43.910 align:start position:0%
to accomplish and
um

02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a a compromise for every
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
other month
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
that you know at least six of the
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
meetings will have
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
public input um i would i would even say
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
remove the word minimum
 
02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
and just stick to the one hour
 
02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:02.309 align:start position:0%
and just stick to the one hour
right

02:26:02.309 --> 02:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think i i think i agree
 
02:26:06.389 --> 02:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
with representative long it's not
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
necessary to to because what if no one
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
shows up what if there are zero people
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
that want to testify do you have to sit
 
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
there for an hour and stare at the wall
 
02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:15.429 align:start position:0%
there for an hour and stare at the wall
well

02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
according to this a minimum of one hour
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
you would be anyways right so why not
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
just i i like representative long's
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion of just
 
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
of just saying you know sometimes in in
 
02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
my public hearings for budget committee
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
or zoning board we open the public
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
session there's literally no one talk no
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
one's sitting there and then we close it
 
02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
again right yeah so that we opened it
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
and closed it as
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
um as part of the process and it's not a
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
minimum of an hour
 
02:26:46.389 --> 02:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
or any time frame i i i definitely agree
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
with representative long's suggestion um
 
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
period after testify online nine
 
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
there it is and delete the rest wait and
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
you're is this on your amendment or we
 
02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
are back at the regular bill on page two
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%

02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
amendment on my amendment
 
02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
line nine nine period after testify
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
after that
 
02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:22.550 align:start position:0%
after that
right

02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:38.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
when i was um
 
02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:43.590 align:start position:0%
when i was um
suggesting

02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
um thoughts from from you i was more
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
talking about like as as a whole because
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a rewrite of the
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
entire thing so did you um
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
have any
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
other topics that were specifically
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your amendment that the
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
commission should look at or um or did
 
02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:02.710 align:start position:0%
commission should look at or um or did
you

02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%

02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
kind of do it similarly to me and
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
so in mine
 
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
if can i use your
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
your amendment as a reference for
 
02:28:23.830 --> 02:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
a lion 11 just says house of
 
02:28:42.309 --> 02:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
representatives yeah i think well i'm
 
02:28:45.270 --> 02:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm trying to translate my i wrote
 
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
off of um representatives representative
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
gay's amendment
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and if you have representative gay's
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
amendment her part c
 
02:28:56.230 --> 02:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
she had put in line eight two domestic
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
violence counselors who have worked at
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
crisis centers
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
have experience in family courts no
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
crisis center policies etc etc and i
 
02:29:05.349 --> 02:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
changed that to
 
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
two appointees from member agencies of
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire coalition against
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
domestic violence so i think that covers
 
02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:14.070 align:start position:0%
domestic violence so i think that covers
because

02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
there is um
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
domestic violence counselor is not a
 
02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
thing like there's nobody has that title
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
so it's not you know i think
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
my version is on line 13 of my amendment
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
okay and it says one domestic violence
 
02:29:30.389 --> 02:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
specialist with a minimum of three years
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
experience it wasn't
 
02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:33.510 align:start position:0%
experience it wasn't
um

02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
like a specific title right it's not
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
capitalized right so it's just a what's
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence specialist though
 
02:29:40.319 --> 02:29:41.510 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence specialist though
um

02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
someone who has familiar
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
familiarity with current policies and
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
procedures of new hampshire crisis
 
02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:50.389 align:start position:0%
procedures of new hampshire crisis
center

02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
center
 
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then they would be appointed by the
 
02:29:55.270 --> 02:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
governor so he would
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
say this person is especially like meets
 
02:29:59.190 --> 02:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
these qualifications and i think that
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
i think i could trust the governor to
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not they're a
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
specialist on that so i would i would
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
suggest that um
 
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
we actually have
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
within new hampshire we have family
 
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
violence prevention specialists
 
02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:18.389 align:start position:0%
violence prevention specialists
um

02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
so um they're called fvps it's a special
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
designation and every crisis center has
 
02:30:26.469 --> 02:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
family violence prevention specialists
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're charged what they do is they
 
02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:30.309 align:start position:0%
they're charged what they do is they
work

02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
half of their
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are to the crisis
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
centers and then they also work with
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
dcyf so when families are identified
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
as having um domestic or sexual violence
 
02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:47.110 align:start position:0%
as having um domestic or sexual violence
um

02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
that has
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
that is part of their case
 
02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
a family violence prevention specialist
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
is brought in to help that family
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
navigate through the family court system
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
while domestic violence and um sexual
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
violence advocates who work for the
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
crisis centers um
 
02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:09.429 align:start position:0%
crisis centers um
can

02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
lend that kind of
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
expertise to this commission for the
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
type of work type of information we're
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
looking for we're looking for people who
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
have worked with families who actually
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
are in the court system and for us
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire those are the family
 
02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
violence prevention specialists that's
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
their job
 
02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
and so i would pro it would be my
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
preference to
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
name them specifically so that we have
 
02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:37.349 align:start position:0%

um

02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%

02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
kind of expertise
 
02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:44.710 align:start position:0%

02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:47.510 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%

with a minimum of three years experience
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
who has familiarity blah blah blah would
 
02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:00.070 align:start position:0%
who has familiarity blah blah blah would
that

02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:01.590 align:start position:0%
that
facilitate

02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%

um

02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:10.150 align:start position:0%
um
close

02:33:10.150 --> 02:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
close
 
02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:11.030 align:start position:0%
close
i

02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
my only other objection is to the three
 
02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
years experience
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
um because
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
if you're asking for someone who has
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
been a family violence prevention
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
specialist for three years
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
that might be a harder sell because the
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
family violence prevention specialists
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
often start
 
02:33:31.110 --> 02:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
in order to move up into that space they
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
already start as advocates so they've
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know you need experience and the
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
education to be a family violence
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
prevention specialist and you know you
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
may have a lot to offer but you've only
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
been doing that particular role for a
 
02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
year and a half where you've been spent
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
six years prior to that working
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
within that system
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
so if we were to just strike the three
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
years of experience i i would be would
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
that work yeah i would are you okay with
 
02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
that one i don't think we need two do
 
02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:02.790 align:start position:0%
that one i don't think we need two do
you

02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:04.389 align:start position:0%
you
yeah

02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i i could yeah one is i could do
 
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
one that's
 
02:34:09.750 --> 02:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
just that just leaves another one out
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
there to be exactly to be doing the work
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
this is gonna be a tough sell to begin
 
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
with so
 
02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:17.910 align:start position:0%
with so
yeah

02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i
 
02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:22.070 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i
uh

02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:22.950 align:start position:0%
uh
i

02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:23.830 align:start position:0%
i
uh

02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:24.710 align:start position:0%
uh
so

02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
kind of what what i'm gleaning from what
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
you're saying is the family violence
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
prevention specialist
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
there are some qualifications of being
 
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
having that title which
 
02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:39.190 align:start position:0%
having that title which
um

02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:40.950 --> 02:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
means that they're going to have some
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
experience with this
 
02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
situation i think the
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
the um familiarity that the the
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
commission will benefit from
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
just by
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
already having that title and so the
 
02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:55.349 align:start position:0%
already having that title and so the
additional

02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
three years of experience having that
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
title is not necessary and so
 
02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:01.429 align:start position:0%
title is not necessary and so
i

02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
have no
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
disagreement with that
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
so okay so i'm fine with that can we um
 
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
can we
 
02:35:15.190 --> 02:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%

02:35:26.469 --> 02:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
and so on line 14
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
familiarity with current policies and
 
02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
familiarity with current policies and
procedures

02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.000 align:start position:0%

in my thing i just said um added an a in
 
02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
fro in front of uh
 
02:35:45.910 --> 02:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
procedures so a
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
current policy and procedure of a new
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire crisis center
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
um i would prefer it say a member agency
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire coalition
 
02:35:57.120 --> 02:35:59.990 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire coalition
member

02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
agency

02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
of what
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire coalition against
 
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence nakadzi
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
so that's our statewide coalition
 
02:36:15.590 --> 02:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:36:18.070 --> 02:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
coalition coalition
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
against against
 
02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:21.990 align:start position:0%
against against
domestic

02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.349 align:start position:0%
domestic
and

02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:23.359 --> 02:36:24.870 align:start position:0%
and
sexual

02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
sexual
 
02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:28.469 align:start position:0%
sexual
violence

02:36:28.469 --> 02:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
you got this
 
02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:31.910 align:start position:0%
you got this
okay

02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think i got great so there's 12 member
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
agencies so
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
within the 12 they'll be able to find a
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
person who has the
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
time and capacity to be able to
 
02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:42.870 align:start position:0%
time and capacity to be able to
participate

02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
participate
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
so are you suggesting that they um
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
who has familiarity with the policies
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
and procedures of a member agency or is
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
just a member of that those one of those
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
agencies personally i think who has
 
02:36:57.830 --> 02:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
familiarity with current policies and
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
procedures is redundant because if they
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
are a family violence prevention
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
specialist that's what they do they
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
don't have other jobs that's that's
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
their only charge
 
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
so who is a member
 
02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:15.110 align:start position:0%
so who is a member
yes

02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
of

02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
a member agency
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
bye

02:37:26.950 --> 02:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
bye
 
02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:28.230 align:start position:0%
bye
okay

02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
beautiful is that was that what kind of
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
the and we're agreed on one
 
02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
yep yeah wonderful i think one is
 
02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:37.830 align:start position:0%
yep yeah wonderful i think one is
enough

02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and did you have others
 
02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
different than
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i had one other one is um under on
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
your line 20 20g
 
02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
an attorney who is also a member of the
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
dove project
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
in in my amendment i had said who is
 
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
currently or has participated in
 
02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
um because dove project members com
 
02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes they cycle in yeah to paste
 
02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
because they're a volunteer
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
if they have a heavy case load at their
 
02:38:09.270 --> 02:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
firm or within their own practice they
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
may bow out of dove for you know 12
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
months and then they come back in
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
dove attorneys who aren't necessarily
 
02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
holding a case in the dove project but
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
could definitely speak to this
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
i like it current yeah an attorney who
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
is currently or has been a member of the
 
02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:31.190 align:start position:0%
is currently or has been a member of the
yeah

02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:32.710 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:33.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
okay
great

02:38:36.790 --> 02:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
the last one was the um mental health
 
02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:51.270 align:start position:0%
the last one was the um mental health
professionals

02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
and i see that you um
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
you knocked them out right they just
 
02:38:56.469 --> 02:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
eliminated it you just eliminated it
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay i thought that that was
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
that was a lot to find for people like
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire when we're like the two
 
02:39:05.670 --> 02:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
can take that kind of time people need
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
to be doing their jobs
 
02:39:09.750 --> 02:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
i thought that was added in there for
 
02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
some of the other things that she had
 
02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
which didn't really have to do with
 
02:39:16.469 --> 02:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
courts but right i also i also took that
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
out so okay
 
02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we're in agreement on that one
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
this is amazing
 
02:39:25.860 --> 02:39:25.870 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:25.870 --> 02:39:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:39:32.230 --> 02:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:33.990 --> 02:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
all right so last thing did we we went
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
over the very end of your amendment on
 
02:39:38.710 --> 02:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
the effective date
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
that the commission's uh report would be
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
due by november 1st of 2024
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
because it starts november 1st of 2023
 
02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
24. and um so currently the bill says
 
02:39:56.309 --> 02:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
ending 2024 is does everyone have a
 
02:39:58.710 --> 02:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
super big um
 
02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
um because it gets repealed in 2023 in
 
02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
my current bill and i wanted to change
 
02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
that to four years so 2026 is is that
 
02:40:08.479 --> 02:40:09.349 align:start position:0%
that to four years so 2026 is is that
now

02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's part of this amendment right
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
wait why why are you why four
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
say we go to
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
and if we feel it's a need then the
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
chair of that
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
commission could come
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
to one of us to put in a bill to extend
 
02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:26.550 align:start position:0%
to one of us to put in a bill to extend
it

02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
i i just think we'll have a hard time
 
02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
getting people to commit to four
 
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
um not only that but if someone you know
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
who was on it for the first two years
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
then isn't reelected it's almost like
 
02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
starting over again with a new person do
 
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm saying
 
02:40:45.349 --> 02:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to go the two and then we
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:49.439 --> 02:40:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we would just have
 
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
another bill like you know if we just
 
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
keep on extending it for two years we
 
02:40:57.750 --> 02:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
just have a bill every single session
 
02:41:00.630 --> 02:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
added for two years if if they're doing
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
good work you know after two years i'm
 
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know if if you think that's going to
 
02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:06.469 align:start position:0%
you know if if you think that's going to
be

02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
be fine
 
02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to it it's up to the
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee i just yeah two years i just
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
think that that um
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
because it
 
02:41:18.550 --> 02:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's a lot after two years people can
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
get very burnt out on this this is very
 
02:41:21.359 --> 02:41:22.950 align:start position:0%
get very burnt out on this this is very
emotional

02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
i go home and am a mess at night you
 
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
know what i mean like
 
02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
because because i lived it i feel that
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
ptsd come back to me all the time
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
so for someone to have to do that for
 
02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
four years
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
is just
 
02:41:39.910 --> 02:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
i feel it's really hard
 
02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:40.630 align:start position:0%
i feel it's really hard
i

02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:41:42.550 --> 02:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
if that they need to be there that the
 
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
same person needs to be there for four
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
years if they if they feel
 
02:41:51.910 --> 02:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
that it's overwhelming then
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
they should be able to step down and the
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know the person appointing them
 
02:41:57.670 --> 02:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
could appoint a new person right but i
 
02:41:59.349 --> 02:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
just think let's do the two years and
 
02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
then if we feel that there's more
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
we can we can you know
 
02:42:06.309 --> 02:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
and we can stay on top of this
 
02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
do we have them sent they should send a
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
report to us too
 
02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
is the report is your recommendation
 
02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
that there be a report after each year
 
02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative or at the end of the
 
02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:24.309 align:start position:0%
representative or at the end of the
commission

02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:27.429 --> 02:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
i am just a vessel for this this
 
02:42:30.870 --> 02:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
committee so what um i am fine with the
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
commit uh report every year um
 
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think that it would be helpful if it
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
was in um
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
um before you know filing deadline time
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
right so that we could
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
address some of those issues that were
 
02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
brought before us
 
02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:47.670 align:start position:0%
brought before us
um

02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
so i would maybe do the first report six
 
02:42:50.479 --> 02:42:52.309 align:start position:0%
so i would maybe do the first report six
months

02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:42:54.389 --> 02:42:54.399 align:start position:0%
from the start
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
get a first report because then we'll
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
have a filing period right if i'm if i'm
 
02:43:00.790 --> 02:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
thinking correctly
 
02:43:03.910 --> 02:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
it starts november 1st
 
02:43:05.990 --> 02:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
no this would start
 
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
once enacted so it could be as early as
 
02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
june of this year and then it gets
 
02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
repealed in november of the 24th right
 
02:43:16.950 --> 02:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
so the first part so on line 26 the
 
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
remainder of this bill should be
 
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
effective upon passage so this
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
commission can be start to be built
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
right away as soon as the bill is signed
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
it's just whether or not we um repeat
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
like when we end the commission right
 
02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
now first report
 
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
six months
 
02:43:39.429 --> 02:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
i think because you figure what by july
 
02:43:41.429 --> 02:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
this will be signed june or july right
 
02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
right so that would mean january so so
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
it'll take a month to put the commission
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
together so their first meeting like
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
realistically on an accelerated schedule
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
the first meeting
 
02:43:56.309 --> 02:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
would be september and that would be
 
02:43:59.590 --> 02:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
organizational there will not be like
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
the first that's ambitious within 45
 
02:44:04.469 --> 02:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
days what about seven yeah
 
02:44:04.479 --> 02:44:06.870 align:start position:0%
days what about seven yeah
months

02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
what about seven months the fir for the
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
first report
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
okay so we see what direction they're
 
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
going in
 
02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:15.429 align:start position:0%
going in
right

02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
that way we can we can see the direction
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
they're going in
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
and say
 
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
is this really what we had in mind or
 
02:44:25.269 --> 02:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
whatever i don't know but if they have
 
02:44:27.269 --> 02:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
some concerns we have time to draft
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
bills we have times to attach stuff to
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendments to bills you know what i mean
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
so i think seven months representative
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
belanger uh thank you madam chair and uh
 
02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
what so
 
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
if if the plan is to have the commission
 
02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
go for two years
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
and then you can readdress the problem
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
close ending closing however you want to
 
02:44:52.950 --> 02:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
phrase it
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
what if
 
02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:56.389 align:start position:0%
what if
instead

02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
instead
 
02:44:57.750 --> 02:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't know because i know we can't
 
02:44:59.110 --> 02:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
bind future
 
02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:00.870 align:start position:0%
bind future
legislatures

02:45:00.870 --> 02:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
legislatures
 
02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:01.990 align:start position:0%
legislatures
but

02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
but
in

02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:45:02.800 --> 02:45:03.750 align:start position:0%
in
the

02:45:03.750 --> 02:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
bill it states
 
02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:07.590 align:start position:0%
bill it states
that

02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:10.870 --> 02:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
an automatic extension
 
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
requested by the chair
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
for additional two years i can do that
 
02:45:17.750 --> 02:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
unilaterally it has to it has to come
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
from everyone
 
02:45:21.429 --> 02:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
the chair doesn't have that doesn't it
 
02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have all no no
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
not you requested by the chair of the
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
commission to the children and family
 
02:45:30.150 --> 02:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
law committee that it would no i think
 
02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
it still has to be i think it's still
 
02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
happening because i just i see an issue
 
02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:36.070 align:start position:0%
happening because i just i see an issue
with

02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
let's just
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know we need to extend this
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
commission two more years and then it
 
02:45:44.469 --> 02:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
so i could for you know unfortunately i
 
02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
could foresee that being an issue so
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
that there
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
may be being a safeguard if you will
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you so so it's
 
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
45 days they have to effective uh the
 
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
first meeting so if it's july august
 
02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
september you're looking at october
 
02:46:11.110 --> 02:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
november is not ready for a you know if
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
you want to submit a notification so
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
what i would do for two years
 
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
then the effect of
 
02:46:19.830 --> 02:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the report is due on november 1st
 
02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:21.030 align:start position:0%
the uh the report is due on november 1st
23

02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
and november 1st 24.
 
02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the two years okay
 
02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:31.590 align:start position:0%
and that's the two years okay
right

02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:32.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
and and then leave it leave it at that
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
i mean it gets repealed
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
after 24 unless
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
the report in 23
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
gives somebody a heads up that we may
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
want to extend this well yeah it would
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
be a sunset just like you know because
 
02:46:50.309 --> 02:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
for instance right now
 
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking about some
 
02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislation coming up that is sun
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
setting two other commissions that have
 
02:46:58.150 --> 02:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
run their course and there has been we
 
02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
already did that oh i missed it before i
 
02:47:02.309 --> 02:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
walked in yes i'm sorry but so what you
 
02:47:04.630 --> 02:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
talked about while i was
 
02:47:06.309 --> 02:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
while i was on the highway having a
 
02:47:09.190 --> 02:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
conversation about my speeding
 
02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:13.750 align:start position:0%
conversation about my speeding
[Laughter]

02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your enthusiasticness to
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
get here yes yes i did explain where i
 
02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
was going and why
 
02:47:22.150 --> 02:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
so nonetheless
 
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
um so what similar to that
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
this legislative body commission
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
began two commissions that were that
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
were to address specific problems and
 
02:47:35.269 --> 02:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
they did that
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
and now there has been we have
 
02:47:39.510 --> 02:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
identified new problems so we have a new
 
02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
commission that is going to fold those
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
others in
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
so what we cannot predict is if in two
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
years this commission
 
02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
maybe it keeps going or maybe it goes
 
02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
into another commission or another i
 
02:47:54.550 --> 02:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
think we need to leave an out for it to
 
02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
either complete its work
 
02:47:56.319 --> 02:47:57.110 align:start position:0%
either complete its work
or

02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:47:57.120 --> 02:47:57.830 align:start position:0%
or
or

02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:48:00.309 --> 02:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
if it's going gangbusters
 
02:48:00.319 --> 02:48:01.110 align:start position:0%
if it's going gangbusters
then

02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
it will it will be it will be asked to
 
02:48:05.670 --> 02:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
be renewed
 
02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:06.469 align:start position:0%
be renewed
so

02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
i think we have to trust the next
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to
 
02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
evaluate the efficacy of the work that
 
02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
we put in place
 
02:48:16.950 --> 02:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
so we'll report november 123 and
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
november 124 yeah and leave it at that
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
all right so we will have
 
02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
02:48:28.830 --> 02:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
was that the
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:56.860 --> 02:48:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:56.870 --> 02:49:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:49:02.710 --> 02:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
do you want to run down there instead of
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
emailing it will that be quicker for you
 
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
explaining it in person
 
02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:10.950 align:start position:0%
explaining it in person
yeah

02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
okay do we want to recess for an hour
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
and have lunch or do this last one and
 
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
how many more do you have just two this
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
one and the one that's being amended
 
02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:28.550 align:start position:0%
one and the one that's being amended
okay

02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:31.269 --> 02:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
i didn't expect it to go on so long
 
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
we are such communicators in this room i
 
02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:34.880 align:start position:0%

02:52:31.110 --> 02:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
i think that this um clarifies more the
 
02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
language um as far as
 
02:52:37.429 --> 02:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
making it simpler for people to be able
 
02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
to understand and follow especially when
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
you um combine this with the um
 
02:52:46.230 --> 02:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
the worksheet that i handed out so that
 
02:52:48.870 --> 02:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
you could see kind of how that math
 
02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
follows through
 
02:52:50.479 --> 02:52:51.269 align:start position:0%
follows through
um

02:52:51.269 --> 02:52:51.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
with each of those definitions
 
02:52:57.510 --> 02:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
and um so i
 
02:52:57.520 --> 02:53:00.710 align:start position:0%
and um so i
hope

02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:02.070 --> 02:53:02.080 align:start position:0%

they did because i just wanted to make
 
02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:27.520 align:start position:0%

what was the vote eight to seven

02:56:43.349 --> 02:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
