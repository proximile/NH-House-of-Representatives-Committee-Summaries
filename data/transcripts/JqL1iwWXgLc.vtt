00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
i think that summary sheet really no
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
so this was from kevin last night
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%

us last night
 
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
um 9
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
26 the first one
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
we adopted that one yesterday with no
 
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.029 align:start position:0%
we adopted that one yesterday with no
changes

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
so that one has already been adopted by
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
the division
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative um edward how do you want
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
to go do you want to
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
vote on each individual piece or do you
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
want to just do this at the end
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll do defer to you uh sitting in
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
the chair to do it how you think
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
makes the most sense uh i i would i
 
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
would tend at this point to go
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
um item by item just to make sure that
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen it and we can have one vote
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
at the end if everything looks okay
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what we'll do so we've
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
already done
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
the first one um 9 26 we already
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
voted on it yesterday the second one is
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
um the closure there were no changes to
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
the one that was offered yesterday
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
um that one sets the date for the
 
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.550 align:start position:0%
um that one sets the date for the
closure

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
closure
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
the third one is the study commission um
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
it isn't it's a new amendment because
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
there were some
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
errors in the original and it changed it
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
from the consumer advocate to the child
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
advocate which makes a lot more sense i
 
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.070 align:start position:0%
advocate which makes a lot more sense i
think

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
change

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think we pretty much agreed on that
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
change yesterday
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%

uh number six is the transitional cost
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
we did some amendment to that um we took
 
00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:31.029 align:start position:0%
we did some amendment to that um we took
out

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
the word relocation we removed that
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
from the um but we left in employment
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
employee training
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
we moved a 650
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
000 appropriation um
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
from what i think it was in um the
 
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.070 align:start position:0%
from what i think it was in um the
original

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
930 and we moved that to this
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
particular amendment um
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
it provides the um
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
provides the department with two
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
million and fifty thousand dollars
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
to um do the work they're going to need
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
to get ready
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
for um all the transitional cost of
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
closing down
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
um sununu and getting the children
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
placed in
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
the appropriate appropriate placements
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh number seven and i think we uh
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
agreed with that one yesterday number
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
seven is job training
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
um this is for the people who work at
 
00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.670 align:start position:0%
um this is for the people who work at
sununu

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
sununu
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
who um hopefully we'll
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
want to relocate to a job or to take
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
another job in state service since
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
they've been with us for a long time and
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
they're valuable
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
employees um this would
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
allow them to get some job training to
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
move to a different job
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think there there's a there are a lot
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
of people there who have
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
great skills that we can we can
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
certainly use in other parts of state
 
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.670 align:start position:0%
certainly use in other parts of state
government

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
so um and as we saw when we went through
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
the budget there were
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of a lot of job opportunities
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
available so
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully that that will be a smooth
 
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.470 align:start position:0%
hopefully that that will be a smooth
transaction

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
transition and then finally it was the
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
disposal of the property
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
and we did change that one
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
if you go to that one number eight
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
we just um shortened it and
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
turned the property over to
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
and um those are the ones that we went
 
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.190 align:start position:0%
and um those are the ones that we went
through

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday we i think we had agreement on
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
them yesterday
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
is there any anyone who disagrees with
 
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.509 align:start position:0%
is there any anyone who disagrees with
those

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
with how we um proceeded and with the
 
00:09:54.399 --> 00:10:00.470 align:start position:0%
with how we um proceeded and with the
amendments

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
see no i don't see or hear any
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
disagreement so i would turn it back
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
over to
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh chairman edwards to take a final vote
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
on them
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay question
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
sure sharon um no uh we
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
we also got a email last night from
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
maura o'neal um i would hope that we
 
00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:23.110 align:start position:0%
maura o'neal um i would hope that we
could

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
pass this on to the senate so hopefully
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
she can uh probably
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
work with them to maybe modify or
 
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.710 align:start position:0%
work with them to maybe modify or
whatever

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
with the thoughts she had they obviously
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
came in a little late for us
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
so i assume should be taking those to
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
um chairman edwards i'm turning it back
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
over to you to take the official vote
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
okay uh well thank you um
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
does anyone want us to have popped open
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
each of these attachments just to verify
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
that the summary sheet is accurate or
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh would that just be redundant at this
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
point is there anyone that wants to
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
pop open each one to look at it that
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
would be done just for completeness
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anyone indicating that
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
they would want to do that
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
so uh i would entertain a motion
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
to accept uh the the uh the amendments
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
as documented in the summary sheet that
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
to include the deletion of some
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
amendments that
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
we do not want to offer is is there a
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
motion on that so moved i would move uh
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
we move them all at once so you want to
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
do them one at a time i
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
i was prepared to move them all at once
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
unless you
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh see reason to to do it separately
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
nope all at once is fine with me
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
uh is there a second i'll second it
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
tell us what the amendment will be
please

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen all the details but what
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
it is is is
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency and it it puts
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
some of the language that we've heard
 
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:54.790 align:start position:0%
some of the language that we've heard
about

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
bringing the legislature into the state
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
of emergency limiting the number of days
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
of an emergency
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
and limiting the number of days that i
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
saw some
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
some of it briefly but she's working on
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
it and doesn't have it finalized yet so
 
00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:07.350 align:start position:0%
it and doesn't have it finalized yet so
we

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
we want to have the legislature involved
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
in the state of emergency basically
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
um when will we have it to look at
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
um lynn is working on it right now
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
and uh working with ols she came up with
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
the idea last night she had phone calls
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
with several people
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
who are going to vote against the budget
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
we need all the votes we can get
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
so she tried to find out what would what
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
would bring them along
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
and she's got uh pledges from them if if
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
we do this amendment and we're going to
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
need every vote
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
so i'm hopeful we can bring this in so
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
so uh to your basic question uh
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't i don't
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
really have a problem with it i i would
 
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.670 align:start position:0%
really have a problem with it i i would
just

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
hope that we could meet a couple of
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
boundary conditions
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh one would be that we could see it in
 
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.110 align:start position:0%
uh one would be that we could see it in
writing

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
at least you know 30 minutes to an hour
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
before we
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
get into discussing it and voting so
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
so the earlier we can see it the better
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
i think people need to
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
to think through the implications a
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
little bit and that doesn't really
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
happen for me until i see something
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
i agree so so if we could do that that
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
um and then the other one is i would
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
just ask
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
about um protocol is this
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
is it sufficiently germane to division
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
three are
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
there any rules that we can only take on
 
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.230 align:start position:0%
there any rules that we can only take on
jermaine

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
jermaine
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
hb2s this is a this is this is me
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
asking a question because i this is a
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
little outside of what
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh my experience has been in the last
 
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.150 align:start position:0%
uh my experience has been in the last
month

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
so so if i'll get an answer to that and
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
then represent an order and come back to
 
00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:59.990 align:start position:0%
then represent an order and come back to
you

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
i thought you called on representative
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
nordman i was just telling her to stand
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
by i wanted to get an answer first
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
yes as soon as i have it in writing and
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
in an
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
acceptable form i will see that it gets
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
emailed to everybody
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
on this division and give you time to
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
to look it over and hopefully by what
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
time is it now
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully by one o'clock uh everything
 
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.389 align:start position:0%
hopefully by one o'clock uh everything
will

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
okay and is there an issue with
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
germaness is it sufficiently germain i
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand because it's just
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
outside of
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
of uh what i would consider dhhs
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
and veterans home boundaries i just want
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
that we're that there's no issues with
 
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.990 align:start position:0%
that we're that there's no issues with
us

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
voting it out well emergency declaration
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
is so widespread and i'm sure it applies
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a question
 
00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:02.310 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a question
well

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just wondering if we're
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
bringing in an amendment so maybe mary
 
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.029 align:start position:0%
bringing in an amendment so maybe mary
jane

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
jane
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
and kathy and i will bring in another
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
amendment i
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
can think of something we would like to
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
change in house bill 2
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
so are we open to other amendments if
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a good question and
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
it's a question of fairness
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
and if you have an alternative amendment
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency i think we would
 
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.789 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency i think we would
certainly

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh consider that and if you have a
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
a different amendment that's not related
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
to the state of emergency
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
i i think i would uh give you an
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
one thing please um um
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's the islam you know i just would
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
hope it would be truly
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
important to you and not um
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
dylatory in any way and i don't think it
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
would be but i
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
need to say it i find it pretty amazing
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we will be
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
putting in an amendment to get
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
votes and that that's been publicly
 
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.630 align:start position:0%
votes and that that's been publicly
stated

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
that that's the only reason we're doing
 
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.909 align:start position:0%
that that's the only reason we're doing
this

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
because all the other divisions have
 
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.909 align:start position:0%
because all the other divisions have
finished

00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
finished
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's outrageous but whatever if
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
if we let you put in an amendment would
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
doing horse trading when it's pretty
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
obvious that
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
you're trying to convince your caucus
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
in any way possible whether or not it's
 
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:50.870 align:start position:0%
in any way possible whether or not it's
germaine

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
germaine
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
or not the public is watching this and i
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'm shocked i'm shocked it's sausage
 
00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.830 align:start position:0%
i'm shocked i'm shocked it's sausage
making

00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
just to respond to that i maybe we're
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to win the uh transparency of the
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
year award
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
so there's that possibility as well
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
um representative waller
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering why why wouldn't this
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
have been an amendment that was brought
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
into the full committee when we do
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
when we do the budget so that all
 
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.549 align:start position:0%
when we do the budget so that all
divisions

00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
are the entire um finance committee
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
is involved in this instead of just one
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
division which
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
hasn't really talked about this issue in
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
any of our deliberations i mean we've
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
we've been here for
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know it feels like it feels like
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
a really long time but i guess it's
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
really about a month
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
and we haven't had this before us to
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
think about
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
and to really talk about
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
i just wondered why it wouldn't come to
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
the full full committee
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
and have it available to all of us
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
in more timely manner as chairman of the
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
full committee i'm bringing it forward
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the only division that's left still
 
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.310 align:start position:0%
to the only division that's left still
meeting

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
that hasn't closed its agenda up and
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
some of the things that i found out at
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
our caucus
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
was that i didn't have enough votes and
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
so i've been negotiating with people to
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
get enough votes to pass a budget they
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
don't want to waste the time over all of
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
us to try to
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
craft a budget together that we can
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
agree on in most cases
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
on a lot of the issues and then have it
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
defeated and have all our efforts be for
 
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
defeated and have all our efforts be for
naught

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
naught
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
i've gone through this seems like every
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
time there's a budget
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
and so i wish these people would come
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
forward to us i told them all this in in
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
various caucuses if you want to be in
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
part of the budget
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
come to us early come to our meetings
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
put in your input early
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah they wait till the last minute then
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
they come with demands
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately we've got to try to
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
meet some of these demands
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
so that we can pass a budget that's my
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
most important job as the chairman of
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
this committee is to get a budget passed
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
so i have to take some steps to do that
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
and and uh lenovo and i have been
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
working with the different caucuses as
 
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.029 align:start position:0%
working with the different caucuses as
has

00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative beam he's also been a key
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
player in this working with these
 
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.390 align:start position:0%
player in this working with these
caucuses

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
caucuses
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
and we're finding out things that we are
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
having to go back and say okay
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
so just as we had things come to us like
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
the sununu youth center said you got to
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
do this you got to do that
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
we all agreed on that we all brought
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
that amendment in we had some good
 
00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
that amendment in we had some good
cooperation

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
i'm delighted to see that now this one i
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
have to get cooperation among my own
 
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.310 align:start position:0%
have to get cooperation among my own
group

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
so this is what i'm suggesting i'm
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
asking for the cooperation of the chair
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
of division three
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i will make certain that all of you
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
see the language
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
for a period of time before we vote
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're asking first to come back at one
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
o'clock before
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
the chairman closes out the work of
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
division three because this is the only
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
working division now that i can come to
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
as chairman of the committee
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
so that's what i'm doing thank you
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh well i i i think
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh we can support your request uh i i
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
i it does seem to me that dhhs
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
has been and will be as effective as any
 
00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:16.390 align:start position:0%
has been and will be as effective as any
department

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
in the state government in terms of
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
reacting and responding to the
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the in the state of
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
emergency orders uh and
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad that we'll be able to see
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
something before
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
we uh we have to discuss it i i
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
um what was it also
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
oh so i want to give you a foreshadow
 
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.110 align:start position:0%
oh so i want to give you a foreshadow
because

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
i've i've been talking to some of these
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
folks too
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
and if lynn is working on if
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
representative ober is working on what i
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
think she's working on
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's basically something that puts into
 
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.029 align:start position:0%
it's basically something that puts into
effect

00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
the the the effect of a
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
concurrent joint resolution terminating
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency i think
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's probably very close to that
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
so you haven't seen it exactly yet but
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
it it deals in the same area yes sir
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
mr ripple do you have any thoughts for
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
us because we we
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to go into recess
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
and that we're going to receive
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
a document from representative weiler
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
sent to the entire committee
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
prior to coming out of recess and
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
he said he needs at least till one
 
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.630 align:start position:0%
he said he needs at least till one
o'clock

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's when i'm thinking we would come
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
back out of recess
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts any protocol
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
issues any
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
i just don't want to step on anything
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
i have no thoughts i think if you want
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
to go into recess and come back at 1pm
 
00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:52.950 align:start position:0%
to go into recess and come back at 1pm
that's

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's just fine all right
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
so um so uh representative norgren
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
if if you have um if you have an
 
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.870 align:start position:0%
if if you have um if you have an
amendment

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
i i i would still uh have us discuss it
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think i think that would be fair to
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
you you know the essence of what we're
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
doing you know the essence of why we're
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
trying to do it
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know so um so there's that
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
all right well with that uh let's uh
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll call the meeting of division
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
three into recess until 1 pm
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
so if you would put up the sign mr
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
ripple and cease recording
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
it it's it's one o'clock but i'd like to
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
just wait a few more minutes to give
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:46.789 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%

00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
i have a copy of the amendment myself so
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
i can read it there
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay very good all right uh
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair this is a
 
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.310 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair this is a
uh

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
a way for many of the people in the
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
legislature are upset that we weren't
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
at all in the declaration of emergency
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
and uh wanted to have some say in it and
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
many people wanted to terminate it uh
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
what this does is going forward
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
emergency can only be for 21 days and
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
then if you want to
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
continue it after that you have to have
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
a meeting of the legislature unless half
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
of us are
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
disabled or missing for whatever the
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
emergency was
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
and uh then we can continue to give you
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
another 21 days
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
so basically it's where
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
we're the policy-making body please get
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
us involved
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have a declaration of
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
emergency and you're going to put rules
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
in it so
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
we want to have a hand in it and i think
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
that are elected to to have a hand in
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
new policy
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
want to be involved in anything that is
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
is emergency related so this this calls
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
for us to do that
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
so um if there are questions uh
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
i'll uh i'll recognize people for
 
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.230 align:start position:0%
i'll uh i'll recognize people for
questions

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
is there an an effective date on this or
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
would this be effective upon
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
um signature if it were to make it
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
well um lacking anything else since
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
we're amending
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
hp2 with this i guess it would be a
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
effective date would be when the hp2 is
 
00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:54.149 align:start position:0%
effective date would be when the hp2 is
effective

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
so um it would affect the current state
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
of emergency
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh if it were to be signed by the
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
governor it would
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
immediately apply to the current state
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
of emergency or would the
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
current state of emergency be exempt
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
my opinion is that if it doesn't have a
 
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.389 align:start position:0%
my opinion is that if it doesn't have a
different

00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
effective date then it would be
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
yes i have a series of questions
 
00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.190 align:start position:0%
yes i have a series of questions
actually

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
um which i made let's go ahead and keep
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
asking them this is we're now in the
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
conversation mode
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
okay um the first of all is is
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
um are you aware representative that the
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
edna committee
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
this morning passed a bill that would
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
make this
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
redundant and i'm not sure if it is
 
00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:47.269 align:start position:0%
redundant and i'm not sure if it is
actually

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
um at odds with it some places they
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
actually my understanding is they had
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
three or four work sessions on and they
 
00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.510 align:start position:0%
three or four work sessions on and they
had

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
a public hearing which this bill did not
 
00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:00.789 align:start position:0%
a public hearing which this bill did not
um

00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
and their bill um
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
is quite extensive it calls for um
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
among other things um the
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature to vote um
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
on various parts of this it calls for
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
the involvement of the executive council
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
in in with it not just the governor and
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
so forth um
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
i know that you went and spoke to them
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
as one of the experts they called in
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
um and i just wondered if you were aware
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
that they passed a bill this morning
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you i was not aware
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
and does that make it any different the
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
fact that they passed a bill this
 
00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:41.350 align:start position:0%
fact that they passed a bill this
morning

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
for the need for this um
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
since there is a bill that's going to be
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
coming in front of us the same day
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
or the same three days as the budget
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
would that change your opinion for the
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
need of this
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
well i guess we're going to rely on the
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
senate to work this all out
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
and they may take this out in lieu of
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
keeping the other one which is more
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
detailed perhaps and
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
has had more study but for now this is
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
this is a request and i i acceded to it
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
and i said i would put it in and i did
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
thank you because i do know this morning
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
you said that it was
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
um in order to have the budget passed
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
that you needed this in so i didn't know
 
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.310 align:start position:0%
that you needed this in so i didn't know
if

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
the other bill would would help with
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
that request um
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to ask the questions i have
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
on the the the
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
actual bulk of this bill um or this
 
00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:34.149 align:start position:0%
actual bulk of this bill um or this
amendment

00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
i first of all i'm curious as far as
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
what some terms
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
mean um the terms incapacitated
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
and missing are not defined here
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious as to what they mean
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
that they seem
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
clear but they could mean quite a number
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
of things incapacitated for instance
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
um could mean the person is
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
incapacitated in that they are
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
incapacitated and that they have a fear
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
of catching covet or whatever virus
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
that so they don't want to leave their
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
house or does it mean that they're
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
if this were a real serious emergency
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
atomic bomb a hurricane that
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
tore all our wires down or perhaps
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
injured us and floods and so on
 
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
but there was something horrible enough
 
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
but there was something horrible enough
that

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
we're not able to get a majority of the
 
00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:29.750 align:start position:0%
we're not able to get a majority of the
legislators

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
to a meeting and that this would take
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
the place
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
if it's that bad so it's it's
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
kind of leaves it up you know not
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
everybody would be incapacitated to the
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
same extent but if you had
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
if you're unable in other words the
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
intent is
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
can you get a meeting of a majority of
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason you can't either
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
they can't get there because the roads
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
are broken or
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
open and big gaps in the roads or
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
their cars don't work because of emp uh
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
explosion or something like that then
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
yeah there would be a problem
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
with it tries to foresee many other
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
things and
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
and these these terms are probably
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully taken broadly
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
like you say incapacitated could take
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
many forms
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay and so i would assume the same
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
thing with missing is that
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're leaving to the clerk to define
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
what those terms are
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
well in other words we can't contact
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
that person we've tried eight times
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
it could be that the phone doesn't work
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
could be that they're uh
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know living in a tent they can't get
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
in the house it could
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
could be a lot of things but in other
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
words missing as far as
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get a group together so it's
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
kind of very broad interpretations
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
we tried to get a meeting of the
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
legislature and
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know 100 didn't answer the phone
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
100 the town police reported they're
 
00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.590 align:start position:0%
100 the town police reported they're
missing

00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
missing
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know and so on like that all right
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
the next question i have is is regarding
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
the clerk i was a little alarmed that
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
is the person that's given all the power
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
in here to make these decisions the
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
clerk while
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
um is is elected by the legislature
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
has no accountability to the the
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
citizenry of the state
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
they're elected by the legislature why
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
did you choose the clerk
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
instead of the leaders of the two bodies
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
being the president of the senate
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
or the speaker of the house which are
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
elected by at least by their districts
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
and then by their peers
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm a little concerned that we're
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
leaving the the entire power
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
to make this decision of who's missing
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
who's incapacitated and so forth
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
to somebody that's um only accountable
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
to the legislature not accountable to a
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
larger group
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
in the citizenry um i would have been
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
much more comfortable had it been
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
um somebody that's elected by at least
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
some portion of the citizenry
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
the um the speaker and the majority
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
leader quite often
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
are from a pretty good distance from the
 
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.109 align:start position:0%
are from a pretty good distance from the
capital

00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
but generally the clerk's fairly close
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
and somebody that is a responsible
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
person who knows all the numbers
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
who knows all the names and usually has
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
access to them
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
and all the contacts then that person
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
is likely to be able to get to the
 
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.430 align:start position:0%
is likely to be able to get to the
capitol

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
capitol
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
and perform those duties whereas if your
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
head like
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
gene chandler is is two hours away
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh what if what if there was a problem
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
between where he lives and getting to
 
00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.030 align:start position:0%
between where he lives and getting to
concord

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
um the majority leader could be going in
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
another direction where
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to get there this is
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
let's assume some some
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
travel uh problems to great to gather
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
and it also assumes that the clerk is
 
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.430 align:start position:0%
and it also assumes that the clerk is
nearby

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
nearby
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
and has access to the lists and the
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
names wouldn't have to dig them out if
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
he could get to the capitol and the
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
capital was intact it would have those
 
00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.829 align:start position:0%
capital was intact it would have those
records

00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
but the speaker couldn't have them in
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
his home or
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
or wherever they the uh people in charge
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the house would
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be on the charges but does it give
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
you any
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't know discomfort in the fact
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
that it's someone that isn't elected and
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
is not accountable to the general
 
00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:20.230 align:start position:0%
is not accountable to the general
population

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh well not in this case there is
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
they're responsible to the house
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
and if they're doing something that the
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
house doesn't like they could be
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
replaced at any time
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
first we'd have to have a gathering
 
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.390 align:start position:0%
first we'd have to have a gathering
right

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
and then i guess this is just a
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
communication person to do communication
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and then the other question about
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
um definition is what would be a nominal
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
state of emergency in the last
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph that's added about a nominal
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
state of emergency as opposed to a
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know a full state of emergency i
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
guess and i'm curious what a nominal
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
state of emergency is
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's one it's it's named an emergency
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
but it's not an obvious thing
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
like oh for some reason we can't get
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
money out of a bank is that really an
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
emergency well
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
there's people looking for us to spend
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
it so how do we get
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
all these creditors are coming here we
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
can't the banks there's a bank holiday
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
the government has declared at some
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
moments the only thing that's an
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
emergency is we can't get at the money
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
okay what do we do now well we're gonna
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
have to declare an emergency just to get
 
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.150 align:start position:0%
have to declare an emergency just to get
the

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
predators to back off uh because we
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
can't cash our checks we can't get our
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
money out of the bank and so on so
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's named an emergency but looking it
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
has no appearance of an emergency that's
 
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.550 align:start position:0%
has no appearance of an emergency that's
nominal

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then i guess just my last question
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
again is is
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
why is it so important as i said the
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill did pass
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
in the edna committee today which was a
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
policy committee
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
after a great deal of study and a great
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
deal of work why is it such an emergency
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
to bring this in
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
in a division in the budget instead of
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
going through the policy committee
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
for a policy um instead of putting it in
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
a budget bill
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
where it really isn't a monetary bill
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
i guess there was some fear by those who
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that it was like
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
belt and suspenders that what if the
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
what if the committee the edna committee
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree on something what if it
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
had language in there that
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't pass uh it's like two bytes of
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
the apple so
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
all right we'll get it one way or the
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
other so
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
and as i said i have to i have to try to
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
get people to vote for the budget
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
and uh if this is something that i can
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
get him to agree to to vote for the
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
budget then
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%

00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
there um i just wondered if
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative wyler
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
could sort of walk through
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
um the clerk would
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
you you tell me how it would actually
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
work i'm having some
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm having some difficulty following how
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
this how this works
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
governor could declare a state of
 
00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:42.790 align:start position:0%
governor could declare a state of
emergency

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
the legislatures are available say it's
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
july august
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
and we could be called in
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
but um they didn't do that they just
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
declared an emergency but now he's got
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
21 days
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
so we're all hearing about it we're all
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
wanting to know what's going to go on we
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
all want answers we all
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
want to be able to have some input into
 
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.150 align:start position:0%
want to be able to have some input into
this

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
and uh and we call up in the
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
the uh speaker tells puts out the word
 
00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:14.069 align:start position:0%
the uh speaker tells puts out the word
to

00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
to heaven have us gather or the
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
president of the senate
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
and they they try through the normal
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
means and they also assign the clerk to
 
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.270 align:start position:0%
means and they also assign the clerk to
call

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
call
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
and if so speakers put out the word
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
through the regular channel if it
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't work through the regular channel
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
then the speakers or the clerk's going
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
to try several other channels
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
and put his staff to work making all
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
phone calls and
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
call towns and see if town is affected
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
in the emergency that
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
nobody can get in or out of a particular
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
town and so
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to try to get a a uh a
 
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.510 align:start position:0%
they're going to try to get a a uh a
quorum

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
assuming that this emergency has kept
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
people from traveling or kept people
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
from communicating
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
there might there might be an inability
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
to contact some members how many members
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
you don't know it depends on what part
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the state was
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
affected and how widespread it was but
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
assuming it didn't affect
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
the whole state maybe we could get a
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
quorum together
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
discuss what the problems were talk
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
about how we would
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
and use the collective of all the
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
state reps with knowledge of whatever
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
they're part of the state that's left
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
what things are available and use more
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
than just uh
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know the emergency planning and the
 
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.470 align:start position:0%
you know the emergency planning and the
governor

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
to try to help uh away the emergency
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
and come up with ideas of what to do
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
just to have more heads in the game than
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
just a handful so that's that's what the
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative i did thank you um
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
so what we're really saying
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
this removes the power of the highest
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
elected official in the state the
 
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.589 align:start position:0%
elected official in the state the
governor

00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
and it gives the power to the clerk
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
of the house is that can you
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
mr representative weiler can you explain
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
that to me am i
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
reading this correctly or am i not
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
reading it
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
the way it's meant to be the uh
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
declaration of the emergency would
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
likely all first come
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
would have to come first from the
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
governor i have selected a patient
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
then in consultation with those other
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
we would gather as appropriate the only
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
power the clerk has is to discern
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
whether we can contact everyone or not
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
and whether we can get an answer from
 
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
everyone or not that's his only power
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
is to see if there is the availability
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
the alternative methods that would have
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
been used by the clerks
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
by the speaker's office are also in
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
effect so
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
the clerk is working and so is
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
leadership working
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
of both parties to try to find how many
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
people are
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
able to travel able to to join and
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
and then then the clerk is going to add
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
him up and he's going to say well
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
we've only been able to contact 150
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
people or whatever
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
but that would then return the power to
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
if we are unable to gather and act but
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
if we are unable to gather an
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
act then we will have consultation with
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
the governor and
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
probably the emergency preparedness
 
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.230 align:start position:0%
probably the emergency preparedness
person

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
and get everything explained to us since
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
we are the
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
people close closest to the citizens
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
then we would be able to get back to our
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
citizens and give them more details
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
because some of them
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
if everybody called emergency management
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
they'd never get through on the phone
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
but if 350 of us could gather
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
get a good detailed briefing when we go
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
back home anybody calls us
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
we can give them the details of what's
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
happening what's expected
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
and where to go and what to find and so
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
on and we could also help pass on
 
00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:23.430 align:start position:0%
on and we could also help pass on
information

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
um through our contacts so
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
the idea is to get more people involved
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
so that we can all have a hand in this
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
and also be helping thank you
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
your hand is still up representing
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
northern do you have a question
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
no i think i think i
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand how it's being done and
 
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.390 align:start position:0%
don't understand how it's being done and
i

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
think i can't help so thank you
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
so i i have a few questions
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative wilder if i may
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
um yes there's a few of them and i would
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
just like to
 
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
use these to try to establish something
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
like a problem statement because we have
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislation here
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's you know the purpose of which is
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem and i'd like to just
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's a common view of what we think
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
that problem may be
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
so um is is it
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
is isn't it true that in the new
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
the governor's uh powers were
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
intended to be uh less significant than
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
the legislatures
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
which is in part why we have an
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
also as a kind of a regulating body
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
over the governor yes we have one of the
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
weakest governors of the
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
states and so isn't it
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
true that um the current rsas
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
around state of emergency uh were formed
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much in the immediate aftermath
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
of 9 11.
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
i think so and then
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh isn't it true that uh this state of
 
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.790 align:start position:0%
uh isn't it true that uh this state of
emergency

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
is the first time since those laws were
 
00:46:07.119 --> 00:46:08.150 align:start position:0%
is the first time since those laws were
enacted

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
that the state of emergency powers were
 
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.270 align:start position:0%
that the state of emergency powers were
uh

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
used yes
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
do you share as i do a belief that
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
there is a significant amount of the
 
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.349 align:start position:0%
there is a significant amount of the
legislature

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh that that believes that its
 
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.510 align:start position:0%
uh that that believes that its
legislative

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
role uh with during this state of
 
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.349 align:start position:0%
role uh with during this state of
emergency

00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
has been minimized beneath the role
 
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
envisioned in the spirit of our
 
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.470 align:start position:0%
envisioned in the spirit of our
constitution

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
yes i would and then
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
after watching the way the state of
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
emergency has
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
played out um do you do you share as i
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
do the
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
the idea that um there
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
there does not appear to be any firm
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
metrics that the public currently
 
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.230 align:start position:0%
metrics that the public currently
understands

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
understands
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
to be the conditions under which the
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
state of emergency will be lifted
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
yes and if there are no firm metrics
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
under which the current state of
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
emergency could be lifted
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
isn't it potentially possible under our
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
current statutes
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
that the state of emergency would last
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
in perturbity
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
it could happen unless there was some
 
00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:29.430 align:start position:0%
it could happen unless there was some
control

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
so then isn't it true that about the
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
only check
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
on the governor's budget under the
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
current rsas
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
is whether or not we pass a budget
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
because if we do not pass a budget
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's ability to resource the
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
operation of the government in an
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
emergency is limited it's constrained
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
stopped but it's constrained it is
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
constrained yes
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
so then isn't it reasonable to believe
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
that since the budget is our only
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislative check on the on the governor
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
that we use the budget process
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
as a way of refining and reestablishing
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
an appropriate balance between the
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
all um those those were my questions
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative rogers yes um
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that a um bill that
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
passes into statute
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
is not effective in um in
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
i haven't the statute that did pass
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
didn't have a way to end it this one is
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
is doing that and i believe the one
 
00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.549 align:start position:0%
is doing that and i believe the one
that's

00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
before ways and means as a way to to
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
have our
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
involvement the legislation involved in
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
ending a state of emergency but i think
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
under current laws i don't think there
 
00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.589 align:start position:0%
under current laws i don't think there
is

00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
um so may i clarify that answer for you
 
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.750 align:start position:0%
um so may i clarify that answer for you
sir

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
yes i i i do believe under current rsa
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
there is a way for the legislature to
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
halt a state of emergency
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
and that is depend upon uh a
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
joint concurrent resolution of the house
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
and the senate
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that gets to be problematic when the
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
house and the senate are not
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
in session because uh with ols shut down
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
there is no administrative method
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
by which a legislature can initiate a
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
joint current resolution
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
particularly when the house rules do not
 
00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:48.309 align:start position:0%
particularly when the house rules do not
permit

00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
a legislature a legislator to
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
directly introduce a bill to the house
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
without passing through
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
the ols registration process
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
i i think that's maybe a more complete
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
answer sir
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes i agree representative rogers
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
yes so i guess what i'm asking is the um
 
00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:10.069 align:start position:0%
yes so i guess what i'm asking is the um
the

00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
um house bill that passed edna today
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
as i spoke to earlier you don't believe
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i guess i would open this to both
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair both mr chairmans um
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
neither of you believe that that bill
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
would enable the
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to do the same thing that
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment does
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
well as i said it's belt and suspenders
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
either one or the other will pass
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
and if if the one that passes the house
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
then goes on to the senate and the
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
senate has both of these then they will
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
find one of them redundant
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
lightly and probably perhaps not
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
keep them both okay but you did so
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
but you did say a moment ago um that
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
that you thought the budget was the only
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
way to do that and i'm just clearing it
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
up that
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
that you do think that we can do it
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
through statute as well it's this other
 
00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:02.790 align:start position:0%
through statute as well it's this other
one

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
no our budget is is the main way of
 
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.069 align:start position:0%
no our budget is is the main way of
controlling

00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
controlling
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the other parts of government as the
 
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.510 align:start position:0%
the other parts of government as the
legislature

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
because we can stop their funding but
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's quite a slow process you
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
could stop the funding right now and
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
they could spend whatever they had
 
00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:18.150 align:start position:0%
they could spend whatever they had
already

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
so but yes the budget is a prime means
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
of control
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
and it would appropriate to put this in
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
the budget but if we can put it in
 
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.150 align:start position:0%
the budget but if we can put it in
statutes

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
for the other one then i'm sure that the
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
senate will make some adjustments
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
and probably not keep both of these but
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
until that happens i
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
feel like belt and suspenders is a good
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
way to go
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
but it might um it you also said this
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
morning that
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
right now you didn't have the votes to
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
pass it so if a budget doesn't pass and
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
the other bill
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
does that in fact might be the most
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
effective way to
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
to in fact end the state of emergency
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
i agree thank you
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
so so uh representative weiler
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
is it unusual for the house to send two
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
two or more similar bills to the senate
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
for the senate
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
to then accept and determine
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
prioritization and how they'll manage
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
them and
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh merge or or or
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
itl either or both is is this unusual to
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
have multiple similar bills
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's not all that common but it's not
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
totally unusual because sometimes
 
00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:31.990 align:start position:0%
totally unusual because sometimes
there's

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
two different committees that have
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
similar bills and
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they're different mechanism for
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
some reason or other put it in one
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee and not in the other
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
and they might still pass it might still
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
have very similar control
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
systems but um you know and then they
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
would both go to the senate and the
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
senate might have their own version
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
or they might combine them both take
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
parts of one of parts another i've seen
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
that out
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's not unusual for them to have two
 
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.349 align:start position:0%
it's not unusual for them to have two
paths

00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
paths
 
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
to accomplish a mission and quite often
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's senate bills and house bills that
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
read almost identically
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
that are passed into both bodies then
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
the other body decides what to do with
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
the other version
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
so we've had that happening
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
i noticed one hand up from attendees
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
um two two questions one for the
 
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.150 align:start position:0%
um two two questions one for the
committee

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
are there any are there any more
 
00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:32.069 align:start position:0%
are there any are there any more
questions

00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any right now uh
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative weiler would you
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
person named jay rogers i don't know who
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%

ask a question uh to the extent that
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
you're asking a question
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's good process to the extent
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
you you want to um
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know go beyond asking a question i i
 
00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.150 align:start position:0%
you know go beyond asking a question i i
think

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit short of time so if
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
you if you want to do more than ask a
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
question i'd
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
ask you to limit it to three minutes hi

i think we can entertain a limited
number

00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh with the four digits zero one zero
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
second moved and seconded is there any
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh not seeing any
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative wallner is that a you're
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
are you getting ready to say something
 
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
are you getting ready to say something
or

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
no okay so
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
go ahead i i don't want to cut you off
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
if you have a comment and a comment to

if you have a comment and a comment to
make

make
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
no i just i'm i'm just concerned about
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
the process and here we are at the end
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
um and putting this putting in the
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
division three recommendations
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
um i hope that when we get to i hope
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
when we get to full committee
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
that we have a a lengthy discussion
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
about this or
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know that the whole committee the
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
whole um finance committee talks about
 
00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.069 align:start position:0%
whole um finance committee talks about
this

00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
being in the budget um it seems like
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a last-minute
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a last-minute thing and um the
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
other divisions haven't really seen it
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
so i i hope that chairman weiler will
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
full full discussion about it when we
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
get to um
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
full committee thank you i will
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
see two more hands on representative
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
rogers and then representative nordgren
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i just have a concern i i do know
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
that there are bills that go over that
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
are similar
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
to the senate it's not unusual however i
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
think in this case
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
the bill that that edna passed as i said
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
had a number of work sessions brought in
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
a number of experts to speak to the
 
00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:42.870 align:start position:0%
a number of experts to speak to the
committee

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
including representative weiler to speak
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
about the fiscal
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
committee and its responsibilities in an
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
emergency or declaration of emergency
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
including looking at a number of studies
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
that talk about
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
states reactions and how they deal with
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
federal money they had a number of
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
safety advisors talk to them
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
they combined um information and
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
conversation from four different bills
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
that had different ways of of dealing
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
with this and representative mcguire
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
and her committee spent a great deal of
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
time trying to figure out how to deal
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
um in a bipartisan way because you're
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
right a lot of
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
people on both sides of the aisle had a
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
concern about um
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature being locked out of this
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
process over the last
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
year and a half they put a great deal of
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
work in it now we see something that's
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
been put together in a very short period
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
with a number of terms very loosely
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
defined giving a great deal of power to
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
to people that are not elected he could
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
be busy like that's just the way it goes
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
and um and so and then we're just thrown
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
into this
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
at the last minute and told that it's
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
because we need to get votes for the
 
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.349 align:start position:0%
because we need to get votes for the
budget

00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
i know we need to get votes for the
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
budget there's various ways to do it
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
but i think that that we're playing with
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
something very loose
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
and loose and free without a great deal
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
of thought to it which is not the way
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
that this committee traditionally has
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
worked this committee is traditionally
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
um not delved into a lot of policy and
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
then when we do delve into policy
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's to quote clean things up it's to do
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
things with a great deal of thought
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and i think that this is not the way
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
we do things
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
so i i just i don't understand why we're
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
doing this at the last minute why we're
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
doing it with no thought
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
and why we're putting out a product
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's not the best product
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
available um so i'm concerned about it
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
i've had some thoughts ever since i
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
testified before
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
edna i had six years in my air force
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
reserve career
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
that i was attached to the federal
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
emergency management agency
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
i went through several classes and
 
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.829 align:start position:0%
i went through several classes and
several

00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
exercises in those years and
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
i can tell you one thing that you learn
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
in emergency management you never know
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
what's coming
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
and it's always different every time you
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
can never plan for everything that's
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
going to happen you can plan for the
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
ones that have happened in the past and
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
you can see your results of what you did
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
but the next time it's always different
 
00:59:13.359 --> 00:59:14.950 align:start position:0%
but the next time it's always different
so

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
you stay loose and you stay flexible and
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of ideas and a lot of
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
things in mind and so that's the best we
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
can do and this is just
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
an element of it in my mind thank you
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
so representative norton do you have a
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
question comment
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
just a comment thank you mr chair i
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
would just
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
um stress my disappointment in this
 
00:59:39.359 --> 00:59:40.710 align:start position:0%
um stress my disappointment in this
process

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
i think chair edwards you've been
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the whole very fair to the minority
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
in the committee
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm just disappointed that this
 
00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:51.430 align:start position:0%
and i'm just disappointed that this
really

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
colors the way we all feel at the very
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
end of the day and i think it's sort of
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
an embarrassment
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
to the public that we've conducted it
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
this way today
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
so i would just like to say i'm
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
deeply saddened by the way we've ended
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
up our
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
time together on the budget thank you
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
so um representative weiler to
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
echo your comments i've i've been fema
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
trained as well in my army reserve duty
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
and i've spent
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
time in tactical operations centers in
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
the hostile fire zone
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
and in many regards uh what the
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
governor's had to deal with is much like
 
01:00:31.839 --> 01:00:32.549 align:start position:0%
governor's had to deal with is much like
that

01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's dealing with the unexpected and
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
mobilizing um resources and people the
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
best that you can to deal with each
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
crisis i
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
so flexibility is is is key in all of
 
01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.309 align:start position:0%
so flexibility is is is key in all of
that

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh i i agree with all of that so um
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
i i don't have much else to
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
ask you about this other than to
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
highlight the idea
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
that this is um
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
a first step in a process neither the
 
01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.390 align:start position:0%
a first step in a process neither the
edna

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
edna
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
bill nor uh nor
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
the hb2 will become law until the
 
01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:13.510 align:start position:0%
the hb2 will become law until the
governor

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
signs it and so uh that is dependent
 
01:01:17.119 --> 01:01:17.829 align:start position:0%
signs it and so uh that is dependent
upon

01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
upon
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
the the senate's uh action or inaction
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
and um so representative weiler i i
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
would just ask you this
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
if if this were truly important to the
 
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.870 align:start position:0%
if if this were truly important to the
legislature

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
and it was of chief importance
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it actually be better to put it
 
01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.430 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it actually be better to put it
into

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
a budget then it would be into a statute
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
because it would be harder for the
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
governor to veto
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
the budget if it came to that
 
01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.190 align:start position:0%
the budget if it came to that
yes

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
so um are there any other questions or
 
01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:57.510 align:start position:0%
so um are there any other questions or
comments

01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
all right not seeing any uh this was
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
the uh further communication after the
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
motion was
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded um and so
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
i think we're ready to take a roll mr
 
01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.230 align:start position:0%
i think we're ready to take a roll mr
clerk

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%

walden
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
no representative nordgren
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
no representative rogers no
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
representative edwards yes

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
all right so uh i believe
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
that completes all of our budget work
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh to date and the division three has
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
completed its budget work
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
