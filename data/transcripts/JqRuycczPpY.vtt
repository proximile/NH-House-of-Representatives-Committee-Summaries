um january 14th conversation the one
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
thing i learned was that if you're not
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
talking straight into the mic
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
nobody in the in the youtube world can
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying on motion so i'd
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
ask you that when we're voting and when
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to make sure you're
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
talking directly into the mic and when
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
you're all done
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
kill it make sure the red light's off
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
because we only have three mics on out a
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
time the fourth person
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
won't be able to speak so make sure you
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
remember to turn your mic off with that
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%

this year i even attended the
legislative

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
our present legislation was presented
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
and public input was allowed to be given
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
person who spoke
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
for marine fisheries was very
 
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.790 align:start position:0%
for marine fisheries was very
adamant

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
adamant
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
that there were problems with this even
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
with the amendment and she listed them
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
very clearly
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
one was
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
that if scuba divers are searching for
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
lobsters they could possibly
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
disturb underwater habitat which to me
 
00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:09.269 align:start position:0%
disturb underwater habitat which to me
is

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
she also mentioned that our juvenile
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
lobsters are on decline and so this
 
00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:18.310 align:start position:0%
lobsters are on decline and so this
would

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
further that decline also maybe put our
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
lobster uh fisherman at
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
um a disadvantage and then there's the
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement issue of you can't
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
look at a trap when you realize that
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
there's a diver down below you can't
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
bring a boat up to there to to check a
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
trap so i i will not be able to support
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%

um i too was concerned initially when we
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
first heard the testimony about the
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
disturbing of lobster breeding grounds
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
and the sediment
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
and potentially
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
i guess almost cruel manner of taking
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
but we heard from one of the most
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
preeminent wildlife biologists and
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
conservationists in the state weldon
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
bosworth whose
 
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.990 align:start position:0%
bosworth whose
conservation

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
and knowledge i i absolutely it's
 
00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:15.670 align:start position:0%
and knowledge i i absolutely it's
unimpeachable

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
unimpeachable
 
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.790 align:start position:0%
unimpeachable
and

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
not only did he describe the actual
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
method of take which involves and other
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
divers did too which involves teasing
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
them out but further and i believe we
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
might have more information to this
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
divers are currently allowed to take
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
crab crab
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
occupy the same areas as the lobster and
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
the method of take is the same as well
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
given that and the knowledge that the
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
divers who are interested in this
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
actually are scheduling a meeting with
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee to go into detail
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think it is probably good that we
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
allow this to go through with the
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendment and allow the senate to
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
fine-tune anything that they might
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
discover in meeting
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative reid
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative spelaine is recognized
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um to representative
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
reed's point
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
i will point the committee to uh rsa 211
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
colon 18-c crabs
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any provisions of this
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
chapter to the contrary any person may
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
take 12 crabs a day by angling diving or
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
by hand
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
so fish and game already
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
checks divers when they come up to make
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
sure they've only got 12 crabs they've
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
already got the ability to count to 12
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
so they can count to any number that we
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
set for lobsters and i don't think
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's any problem where they can
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
already take crab it's already in our
 
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.630 align:start position:0%
already take crab it's already in our
statute

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
let him take some lobsters as well
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
bill better
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%

this bill mr chair
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
we already know have heard in many
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
testimonies of many bills in front of
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
fish and game the lack or reduction in
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
workforce and the number of conservation
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
officers that are needed to
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
supply the state with the safety and
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
there's a concern that we are going to
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
stretch them even more thin when they
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
have to walk the beaches to try and
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
check on making sure that
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
egg-filled mother lobsters aren't being
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
taken accidentally by novice
 
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.149 align:start position:0%
taken accidentally by novice
lobstermen

00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
lobstermen
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
i was glad to hear that the
 
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.990 align:start position:0%
i was glad to hear that the
lobstermen

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
lobstermen
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
in the professional sense are welcoming
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
conservation officers and marine um
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
resource officials to come on their
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
boats and check their catches and
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
educate them if they are making errors
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
is a good thing that happens and a good
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
use of their time and by allowing
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
individuals to then catch lobsters on
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
the beach it's going to stretch their
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
time even thin
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
time that we already know is stretched
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
in through the lack of conservation
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
officers that we fund in the state and i
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
have a grave concern on how that will
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
begin to affect the bigger picture of
 
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.470 align:start position:0%
begin to affect the bigger picture of
safety

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
the second one is actually a safety
 
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.870 align:start position:0%
the second one is actually a safety
issue

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
i have three close friends that are
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
scuba divers
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
no one is ever directly under their flag
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
where it's posted
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
that means there's a diver in the area
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
if folks want to
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
scuba dive to catch lobsters they're not
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to go out in the middle of the
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
ocean where nobody is they're going to
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
go where they think the lobsters are
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
that means they're going to go near
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
where the lobstermen's boats are
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
which means they could get tangled in
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
cages tangled in ropes and i think it's
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
a safety issue for me in terms of
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
allowing them to get access to areas
 
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.149 align:start position:0%
allowing them to get access to areas
that

00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:15.190 align:start position:0%
that
fishermen

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
fishermen
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
are working and
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
it it just bothers me i i know that
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
scuba divers are safe minded folks but
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're never directly under their flag
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
so fishermen will not know exactly where
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
they are and if they're looking for
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
lobsters they may not exactly know where
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
all the lobstermen's traps are so those
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
two concerns of the amount of staff that
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
would take to police this bill and the
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
safety concerns
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think you can understand that i would
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
not be able to support this bill thank
 
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.549 align:start position:0%
not be able to support this bill thank
you

00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representatives
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
matt can you turn your mic off
 
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.990 align:start position:0%
matt can you turn your mic off
um

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative reed
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair in terms of the
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
safety concerns what i understand from
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
the many states that already allow this
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
is this has almost never been an issue
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
and i certainly trust the department to
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
be able to regulate
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
how close a diver is allowed to get to a
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
boat or vice versa
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of the rest i again i when i
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
first heard the testimony
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
i was kind of surprised because my
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
natural instinct would be to think that
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
commercial operations would be far more
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
disruptive than um then single
 
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.590 align:start position:0%
disruptive than um then single
individual

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
diver taking in in a way very similar to
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
how they've done it for thousands of
 
00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:28.630 align:start position:0%
how they've done it for thousands of
years

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
again after i heard the testimony of the
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
divers and weldon bosworth again whose
 
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.390 align:start position:0%
divers and weldon bosworth again whose
conservation

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
understanding cannot be is just
 
00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:41.029 align:start position:0%
understanding cannot be is just
unquestionable

00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
unquestionable
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
it seems that my original suspicion that
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
in fact those individuals cause far less
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
disruption to the natural environment is
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
actually correct and i can understand
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
how the commercial
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
lobster industry might have a lot of
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
pull and
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
influence with the department but
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i will be supporting
 
00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:03.029 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i will be supporting
otpa

00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%

we're already

taking crab by diving and fish and game
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%

00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
there's no extra staff situation that i

there's no extra staff situation that i
see

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
necessary when they're already checking
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
divers for their take on crab
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
in response to the
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
diver safety situation i will point out
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
that no diver's going to dive and look
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
for crab in the wide open water where
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
the traps were likely going to be laid
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
they tend to dive closer to shore along
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
the cliff lines and such and then tickle
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
the lobsters out with a tickle stick so
 
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
that they can take them by hand
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
you won't find lobster boats fishing
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
right next to the rocks on the shore
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
because that's where they're going to
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
get damaged and they're not going to lay
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
a trap there because it's it's not a
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
good place to drop a trap where it can
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
get caught in the rocks
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
so that's my testimony and i will be
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
supporting otpa
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative explaining
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative khan
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have the equal
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
concern about about this bill
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
that other representative mentioned
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
about the safety
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
that uh we're gonna
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
we might
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
in the process we might
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
destroy the habitat
 
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.510 align:start position:0%
destroy the habitat
uh

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
see uh new hampshire sea coast is very
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
small sea coast like just say 17 mile
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
the lobster industry is working very
 
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
the lobster industry is working very
well

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.909 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's we should be happy the way things
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
are going we if we touch this
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
we might be
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
you know we might be
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
destroying the industry and you know
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh we'll be sorry and later so i i'm not
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
going to vote for this bill
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any further
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
discussion representative harvey
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
thank you and i do appreciate the
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
information concerning the crab industry
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
the idea that we hunt crabs so therefore
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
we should be able to
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
have lobsters as well but but none of
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
that um addresses the issue that was
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
brought up at fish and game concerning
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
the decline in juvenile lobsters and
 
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.149 align:start position:0%
the decline in juvenile lobsters and
um

00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
this this is a bill that would hasten
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
that decline thank you
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
any further comments or questions
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
singing on the chair is going to just
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
make a statement
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
again you know on this amendment on this
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
bill i have every faith and fish and
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
game and all the right regulations build
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
and manage species and manage what's
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
going on within their staffing concerns
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
and everything else
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
i believe that you know when you talking
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
about the taking of lobster
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
especially when you bring in the fact
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
that we take crab in a similar manner
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
with crab pots and and by taking that
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
the method isn't any different um
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
currently the same dive regulations
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
about where a boat can go if a man's
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
just out diving is the same whether
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
taking lobster or not right you have to
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
maintain a certain distance so that
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anything about the safety
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
evolving the interaction between
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
divers and lobstermen
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
the last thing i'll say it was clear
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that we heard that
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
the environmental police in
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts have had zero reported
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
cases of incidents between
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
lobstermen and scuba divers right they
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
haven't had this this isn't hasn't been
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
a problem um they were more likely to
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
have an incentive lobster and a
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
lobsterman than they were between a
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
lobster and a fisherman so
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
i think the the bill goes way to
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
supporting our citizens and their right
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
to not have to own a sixty thousand
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
dollar boat or more to be able to go out
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
and take lobster uh and and use that
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
natural resources we have here in new
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire um and i again lastly i i have
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
every firm confidence and belief that
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
fish and game will manage it through the
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory process and rules that'll go
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
before jalcar and have another
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislative look um
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
to support this this uh program so with
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
that being said we're gonna move to a
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
discussion and debate uh i'll just speak
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
to my amendment um so again this bill i
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
want to be careful we talk about
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
invasive species and and and and putting
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
the herd at risk and all of those
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
conversations we heard in the last in in
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
the public hearing but the reality is
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
this is a process bill this isn't about
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
the denial or the approval process this
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
is just about the fact that we want to
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
process in place we heard testimony from
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
the last gentleman
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
where he was denied a permit from
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
fish and game and then there was a dead
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
end there was no place to go he had he
 
00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:58.389 align:start position:0%
end there was no place to go he had he
had

00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
conflicting science he wanted to present
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
and basically was told no we don't care
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it and i felt that
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
was an inappropriate action
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
and that there should be some sort of
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
process for citizens who um again were
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
leaning on the executive driver director
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
heavily so he makes that ruling as a
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
singer and he's responsible for it as a
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
single individual and that there should
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
be an appeal process for that so this is
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
about an appeal process and about the
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
permitting process
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
and requiring fish and game to respond
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion six i expanded by
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment the amendment expands it
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
to 60 days which i think is reasonable
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
in my conversation with colonel jordan
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
this morning he felt that was a
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation to move it out
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
to 60 days
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
they already have their list of species
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
that are denied right just outright
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
because they know it's a problem
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
and they can still rely on that and
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
immediately deny a permit
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
but it allows the citizen the ability to
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
if they feel the denial is
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
not based in science and i'm going to
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
give you an example as to why this bill
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
came forward
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
is in that conversation that last
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
fish and game on their website has
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
cdw free states listed
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
which means that pryon disease doesn't
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
exist in those states by whatever means
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
they determine that prion disease
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist in those states
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
the gentleman that was trying to import
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
the reindeer was importing from one of
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
those states and yet the very reason
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
that fish and game gave was they were
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
afraid of prion disease from a state
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
that is listed on their website is not
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
having prion disease so there was
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
conflict there in the science and and
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
there was no place to turn it was once
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
the gnaw was given it was given and
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
there was no place to go
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
and so the idea behind this bill is to
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
give our citizens the right to have a
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
hearing a secondary hearing if they
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
disagree like in this case there was
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
conflict in the direct science efficient
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
game in one place on their website they
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
said there's no prion disease and
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
another and yet they were denying
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
a permit based on prion disease didn't
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's illogical on its face
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
and so this bill came out of that um and
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
again it's a process it's not about
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
prion disease it's about making sure
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
citizens have good processes in the
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
state and have the ability to be heard
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll open up to any other
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
comments or questions
 
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.669 align:start position:0%
comments or questions

representative khan
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i had concern
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
about this bill when we were hearing the
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
testimony last time we we met here but
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
because of this amendment and it
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
satisfied me i'm going to vote it vote
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
yes on this bill
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative khan any
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative reid i
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
have a genuine real question of the
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
chair um so i remember in the testimony
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
that this was changing the default
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
position to yes does the amendment
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
change that
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
so the amendment is is the same so again
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
that it requires fish and game respond
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the problems with the
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
current law was that they could hold the
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
permit for six months they could hold it
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
for a year there was no requirement for
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
them to actually act
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
and so we wanted to change i wanted to
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
change that i want to
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
if someone is looking to do something
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have to wait a year for
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
fish and game to respond yes or no
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill does is it
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
defaults it to yes if fish and game does
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
not respond within 60 days then the
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
default answer is yes they get their
 
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.150 align:start position:0%
default answer is yes they get their
permit

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
it puts an onus on fish and game to
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
actually act on the citizens request
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this bill
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
we're voting uh i'm sorry representative
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
sherliff go ahead
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
as before i'm going to vote for the
 
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
amendment because the amendment does
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
improve the bill
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
um but on the underlying bill the otpa
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
motion i'll vote against it uh what i
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
would like to see is this bill go to
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
interim study i think an appeals process
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
is necessary but i think it's something
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
needs a little bit more work and
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure if the 60 days is
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
adequate and i would like to hear from
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
fish and game in testimony about that
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
aspect so as i said i'll vote again for
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment vote against the bill and
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
i hope there'll be a motion for interim
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
study thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative harvey
 
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.470 align:start position:0%
representative harvey
i

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
i do believe the amendment makes it
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
better 60 days though to me that
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
actually sounds short um considering the
 
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.390 align:start position:0%
actually sounds short um considering the
staffing

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
issues at fish and game i'd probably
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
like to see 90 days um and i do question
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
that in the underlying bill if the fish
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
and game commission
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
i i do think there should be an appeals
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
process but i'm i question rather the
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
fish and game commission is the right
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
and so i also because of that we'll
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
plan to vote for the underlying bill
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
i would prefer interim study because
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
again i think 60 days is actually too
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
short and um i'd like to have more time
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
to think about this and have more input
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
on on that from
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh fish and game thank you
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you ever just to answer your
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
question about that so again i did have
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
a conversation efficient game and
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that in their 800 rules
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
that they have they have a pretty
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
exciting pretty substantial list of you
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
just can't bring these animals in which
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
they would use as their basis and every
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
time they review they're only going to
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
be reviewing the animals that aren't on
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
that list and every time they review an
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
animal that's not on their list guess
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
where it's going to be added to their
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
list if they deny it so that list will
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
grow and with time and make the process
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
easier and easier as fish and game goes
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
along and the only animals they need the
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
60 days for the ones that are not on the
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
list that are already in their rules so
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
just to make it understand that it's not
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
like they have to take every single
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
species and investigate it they've
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
already done a significant portion of
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
the work and it's already in rules and
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
they can still rely on that for their
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
denial process so it's only the
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
incremental new animals that aren't on
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
their list that they need time to
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
research and i think 60 days to research
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
an animal is pretty reasonable
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative reed
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i was going to
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
reserve my comments for discussion on
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
the bill but i guess we are we're
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
discussing both at once so i mean
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
obviously the amendment makes it better
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
i do think 60 days is probably
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable based on what we heard during
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
i understand the commission doesn't want
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be that body but there's really no
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
one else to put it before if the
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
executive director is the person saying
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
no the only entity to go to after that
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
is the commission really
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
my my concern and i understand why this
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
was placed in the bill because this is
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
kind of the stick right that it has to
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
be you have to respond or it's going to
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
default to yes but i i am still a little
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
bit uneasy about that default to yes
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
because if paperwork gets lost or
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
something could someone bring in a
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
species and as we all know it only takes
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
one species when one member of a species
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
even to bring in something that's
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
potentially devastating to our ecosystem
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
or even human health so i'm i'm
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
genuinely torn because i do think this
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
of the original bill and it's open for
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
anybody who covers anything the one
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
thing i'll remind members is that this
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't the end of the bill
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
it still goes over to the senate and
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
still has a conversation still open to
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
amendment over in the senate
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
so again if members feel that the bill
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
has merit um they can still go over to
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
the senate and help
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
and and amend the concerns out of the
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill that you have over there so
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative harvey
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and i understand that it does
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
bother me a little bit though that um
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
we do our work and then hope that the
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
senate will fix it i i would prefer that
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
we do the best work what we can and send
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
that over rather than um
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
saying well
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
there may or may not be problems so
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
maybe you guys can can do something
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
about it i still would like to see an
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
interim study for this because there
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
seems to be some concerns that were
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
brought forward and
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
i think those concerns
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
should be answered and could be answered
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
through an interim study thank you
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and i might be a little biased
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
representing the shirtless thank you mr
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
chairman mr chim and
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
just to echo the comments of the member
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
from new market i agree that the
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
idea that it's an automatic yes if fish
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
and game does not act within the timely
 
00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.230 align:start position:0%
and game does not act within the timely
manner

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
is concerning and i
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
know that our friend and colleague on
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
this committee from newport uh newberry
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
remembers decades ago when someone had
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
the bright idea of taking a pill full of
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
rock bass and dumping him into lake
 
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.150 align:start position:0%
rock bass and dumping him into lake
sunapee

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
sunapee
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that now it completely destroyed the
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
lake sunapee trout
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i hate to see someone get an
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
automatic pass to
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
import something that could be an
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
invasive species and cause damage to our
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire wildlife so i'll be voting
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
now and again my hope is that there'd be
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
a motion to come forward for interim
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
study thank you mr chairman
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
through rsas and through rulemaking
 
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.109 align:start position:0%
through rsas and through rulemaking
we

00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
we have given the executive director
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
certain powers to make
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
decisions and i really don't like the
 
00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:14.870 align:start position:0%
decisions and i really don't like the
idea

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the fish and game commission being

of it of an appeal process
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
um but i'm really
 
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.109 align:start position:0%
um but i'm really
uncomfortable

00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
with the fish and game commission
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%

that are granted to the executive
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%

that were dumped in sunapee uh i doubt
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
they looked for for any permits to do it
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
um you know people
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%

00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think they came to fish and
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
games asking if we can dump these in and
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
they'll continue to do those things um
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%

citizens that they have a right to be
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
responded to by our state agencies and
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
not be held up for undeterminable amount
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:10.230 align:start position:0%
of time
um

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
and you know i i think this is a good
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
process bill while i recognize
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative leflam's
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
comment about the the commission bottom
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
line is the commission is the policy arm
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
right they we every bill we see comes
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
with a commission recommendation on
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
setting policies so they set policy on a
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
regular basis or they established a
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
policy what efficiency what is going to
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
happen in fish and game so giving them a
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
policy decision or evaluating a decision
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
made by the agency head
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think is unreasonable i think
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
again it's it's not out of the
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse these are the policies
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
they're already discussing um on on what
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
when when rulemaking authority occurs
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
the commission weighs in on what animals
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
are added to that list um on the
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
adoption of rules so again i i think
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
this is a this is well within the
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
commission's policy uh wheelhouse of
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
looking at what's going on and how it's
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
responding to our citizens and whether
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
the science is accurate or not because
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
they're almost presuming they're already
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
looking at science to establish our
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
policies and making evaluations on that
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
so i think this is again a process bill
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's not about any individual species
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's about making sure our citizens are
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
heard and obviously i'll be voting yes
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
to the otpa motion
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%

00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
right no
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%

so uh with the vote being 13 to 6 the
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
otp motion will be the recommendation of
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
the committee to the whole house
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
report required on every vote
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
they can choose to waive it okay that i
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to do yep you can choose if
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to write one i need to know
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
that if you're not then i need to know
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
that just so i can plan i just want to
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
make that clear we've asked for the last
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
two bills or the last couple of bills
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
for minority reports and sometimes it
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
may not be a minority report
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely so know that minority can
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
wave off just unfortunately there has to
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
be a majority report but the minority
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
something um i have i guess it's
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
impossible to move it now because i was
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to kill this bill the
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
not only
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
gets rid of the seizure of hair
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
which solves the potential
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue but what it does is
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
it allows the existing clubs to continue
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
to train on their own
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh live hairs that they have they made
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of testimony about how they
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
had veterinarian checks that they were
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
taking care of these animals properly
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
that they were breeding
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
reasonably well and if that's the case
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
they should be able to propagate their
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
own now having said that i had heard
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
comments about
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
well what about the gene pool and what
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
about if there's kind of a mass
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
extinction event there are five
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
different clubs if they each have a
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
population of hair that they're
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
propagating they can trade keep that
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
gene bull fresh and act as they back up
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
for each other so i prefer to see the
 
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.910 align:start position:0%
for each other so i prefer to see the
amendment

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
adopted which allows the clubs to
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
continue doing everything they're
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
currently doing
 
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.069 align:start position:0%
currently doing
and

00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
yet takes away the ability to just go
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
and take an animal out of out of the
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
wild which really nobody else gets to do
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
like we we say you can't take an animal
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
out of the wild for pleasure but for
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
some reason one group is allowed to so
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to talk to my
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
amendment i don't suspect it will change
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
anything but i wanted to put it out
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
there for the record
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any further
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
discussion on the itl motion on house
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
bill 1308
 
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:11.910 align:start position:0%
bill 1308
so

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative harvey so i just want to
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
be clear we we are not voting on the
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
amendment we are voting on the 1308 bill
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct she just wanted
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
to make the members aware that there was
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment if they wanted to vote
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion and bring a
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
different motion forward she wanted to
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
know that there's an amendment and i'll
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
just speak a little bit representative
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
reid and i did have a discussion about
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
that amendment and it was about the
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional argument i had about the
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
fact that we are taking property from
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
citizens without any kind of due process
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
through the law and that's a significant
 
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.390 align:start position:0%
through the law and that's a significant
problem

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
she wrote an amendment that dealt with
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
that due process issue basically saying
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take the animals and
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
you don't have to set them free um and
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
but i still find that it's
 
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
the problem i have with the amendment or
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
going forward in otp motion is the fact
 
00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.510 align:start position:0%
going forward in otp motion is the fact
that

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's a dead-end road
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
um for the for the clubs right
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately they won't have any rabbits
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then it kills this kills eve it
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
kills the problem so um i i there's not
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
a solution that gives them light at the
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
end of the tunnel and i think it'll
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
that being said we'll go to

uh i'll take i'll take an opportunity
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
i the hike safe program is a phenomenal
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
program within our state it's working
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
extremely well
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do as long as we
 
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
had opened this chapter of law for
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
discussion i was looking to future-proof
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
the legislation to allow fish and game
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
to manage the program as they see fit
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
and not have fees set in statute that
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
are hard-coded and anytime they want to
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
change it they'd have to come back to us
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
and have a wait a year to two year
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
process to try to get something changed
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
so what we're just doing is we're
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
striking the language and the amendment
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
for the fees and we're just giving
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules authority for them
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
to set their fees in their own rules so
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
they can manage the program better on a
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
so anybody else have any questions
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none we're voting on amendment
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
number 2022-0151
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%

00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
so on a unanimous vote uh the amendment
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
is adopted the new motion is ought to
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
pass as adapted
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would just make
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
this comment that i think that the
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is a great thing it actually
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
fixes it to help the program be more
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
dynamic they can
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
now without coming back to the
 
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.270 align:start position:0%
now without coming back to the
legislature

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
to fix a rate or a fee that they need to
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease they can do that
 
00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.150 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease they can do that
themselves

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
and it also allows them flexibility
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
should they decide to set a fee for out
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
of state in the future that is a
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
different fee than we pay for residents
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
they can have a non-resident versus
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
resident fee structure it's completely
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
under the control of them now and they
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
can let this program grow as it
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
dynamically needs to grow
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%

of otp
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
looking to representative craig circuit
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's been moved by the chair of otp
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative craig has
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
opened a further amendment the chair
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
offers amendment number
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
zero one six six h um and looking for a
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
second second
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
so as we move to adopt amendment number
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
zero one six six h
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i'll speak to this amendment
 
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.470 align:start position:0%
and i'll speak to this amendment
so

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
the conference we had we had a
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
significant amount of conversation
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
around this bill
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
um one of our longer committee meetings
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
the thing that i took out of the bill
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
and what i've learned in doing this and
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
why i drafted this amendment is the
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
amount of damage
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
that gray squirrels do
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
to our to our agriculture community and
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
to our residents um as a whole the
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
damage to buildings and such
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
um the second thing i learned in this is
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
that with the exception of the beaver i
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
think this is the only rodent that we
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually have seasoned for
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
um that are all other red squirrels you
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
can hunt whatever you want
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh gophers you can hunt whenever you
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
want porcupines you can hunt whenever
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
you want but for some reason we've
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
pulled out gray squirrels and said no
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to set some sort of limited
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
season on grey squirrels
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
and and considering the damage i've done
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think we all remember
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh squirrel armageddon a couple years
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
ago where you couldn't go five five feet
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
down the road without seeing a flattened
 
01:03:14.799 --> 01:03:15.910 align:start position:0%
down the road without seeing a flattened
squirrel

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
squirrel
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that this is an
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
endangered species i don't think that
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
this is where we're in a problem that
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
we're gonna find we're short of grey
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
squirrels and on top of that we don't
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
live in tennessee i don't think there's
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
a there's a significant portion of our
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
hunting communities out there hunting
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
gray squirrels
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
so that being said i think it's
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate that we we not have a season
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
on this on this uh rodent
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
that people be allowed to take it uh
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
whenever they feel like it
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
that again it's not a it's not an
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
endangered species it's not a herd
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
population a deer population we're
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
trying to manage or a moose population
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to manage the size of the
 
01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
we're trying to manage the size of the
herd

01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
herd
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that um
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
they're not at risk of extinction by any
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
stretch of the imagination and i'm sure
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
our homeowners are having problems with
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
bird feeders and chicken coops and
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
everything else they'll also appreciate
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that they don't have to run the
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
risk of potentially being having to
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
prove that the reason they shot
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
a squirrel was because it was damaging
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
property and having to go through that
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
with fish and game now it's just going
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
to be if the squirrel's damaged you can
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
probably can shoot it you're not going
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
to run the risk of potentially being
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime
 
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.829 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime
so

01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
with that we'll open up a further
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative harvey
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i have two two problems
 
01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.670 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i have two two problems
um

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
we have heard numerous times this
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
morning and in the hearing which i did
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
attend via live stream by the way um
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
that it is up to fish and game to set
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
limits and seasons and so forth and that
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
we have um a great deal of confidence in
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
their ability and their wisdom in doing
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
so and yet this amendment takes that
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
away from them you are setting a season
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
of a non-season
 
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.990 align:start position:0%
of a non-season
um

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
and not letting them do exactly the job
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we've said all morning they're very
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
capable of doing so that that's an issue
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
i also um
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of a problem with
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes comparing animals
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
i think efficient game has done a great
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
job of setting seasons for each
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
individual animal whether it's a
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
squirrel or a porcupine or a fox or a
 
01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:29.510 align:start position:0%
squirrel or a porcupine or a fox or a
whatever

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
and not not trying to lump them together
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
because each one has its own
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
characteristics its own part in the food
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
chain and so forth so i i i don't
 
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
support this amendment at all thank you
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and i am going to answer the
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
question as to why i stepped aside from
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
this conversation of of
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
seasons and setting seasons for fish and
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
game and i i when i drafted this
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
amendment i had that exact argument in
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
mind i'm like i don't necessarily like
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.430 align:start position:0%
doing this
but

01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm doing is because the
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
legislature has broad shoulders and this
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
issue has obviously created a pretty
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
significant divide
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
um between
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
our our various i won't say parties but
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
just issues of you know the animal
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
rights conservationists and hunters so
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that putting fish and game in that
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
political squabble for lack of a better
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
phrase i think is inappropriate is that
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think that the legislature has the
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
broad shoulders to take this on if we've
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
choose to pass this vote then we take
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
the weight on it and we take the weight
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
from those organizations and not fish
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
and game um i'd rather not put the
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
weight on fish and game and have them in
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
the middle of a political argument i'd
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
rather them in or a partisan argument so
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
to speak i'd rather them
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
focus on conserving the animals that our
 
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.950 align:start position:0%
focus on conserving the animals that our
deer

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
deer
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
our fish are our moose our bear you know
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
all the other animals in the state that
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
aren't generally non-partisan
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
non-political right so they're not
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
nearly as as as as divided as we heard
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
the testimony on this bill
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
and so uh to answer your question the
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
reason i did is because i'm trying to
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
take weight off fishing game yes i
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
recognize that this is uh divergence
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
from the statement i usually make which
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
is they're doing a great job let them do
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
their job but in this case it's not
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
it's not as simple as science so to
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
speak um that there's passions that come
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
into play um honestly we heard it we had
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
two and a half hour argument or
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
discussion and and hear hearing on
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
lactating gray squirrels
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
i want to take the weight off fishing
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
game i want to make this i'm going to
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
take the weight on and it's my amendment
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm the one that i think is is it's
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to decide that this
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
is an inappropriate use of fission games
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
time and
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
have the bill pass representative reed
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
we have this argument every year over
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much every bill to what extent do
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
we let fish and game do their jobs and
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
to what extent do we take over
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
this is certainly not the first time we
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
can go through any number of species
 
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.950 align:start position:0%
can go through any number of species
coyotes

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
coyotes
 
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
bobcats you name it
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
however in the past the argument has
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
always been made
 
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.430 align:start position:0%
always been made
that

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
the commission did not decide in uh in
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
unison with their own biologists and
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
that's why we were putting forward bills
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
and had bills before us
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
this is something nobody's asked for in
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
fact for as far as damage done by
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
squirrels we already have rear round
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
open season on uh squirrels that do
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
damage we already can kill as many
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
squirrels that do damage as we want this
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
is specifically in regards to hunting
 
01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.470 align:start position:0%
is specifically in regards to hunting
and

01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
i have being from tennessee have tasted
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
squirrel meat myself
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
but in regards to hunting nobody has
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
asked for this now
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
i think good faith process usually
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
involves two sides attempting to move
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
towards each other understand each
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
other's arguments but instead what we
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
have is one side saying look this looks
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
like a typographical error everybody
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
around us is doing it at this time
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
why can't we move it two weeks one way
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
and then the other side going actually
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to make it the other extreme
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
from where it already was where it was
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
historically for the last 100 years
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
i just don't think that this is a good
 
01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.149 align:start position:0%
i just don't think that this is a good
process

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
and i will be voting against this
 
01:09:19.839 --> 01:09:23.269 align:start position:0%
and i will be voting against this
amendment

01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ballard
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative craig thank you mr
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
many of you won't know me because i am
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
very new to the committee and uh
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
actually i watched the testimony via
 
01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.189 align:start position:0%
actually i watched the testimony via
youtube

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
youtube
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
unable to be here
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i was concerned
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that we were receiving
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
regarding uh some number of orphaned
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
baby squirrels
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
being fortunate enough to to know a
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
small pool of retired wildlife
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
biologists both in new hampshire and
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
vermont i decided to consult my friends
 
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.910 align:start position:0%
vermont i decided to consult my friends
on

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
what this issue might be
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
and i received two very
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
rapid responses
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
the first of which was
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
have you ever seen a squirrel hunter in
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
alluding to the fact that it is a very
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
small percentage of our small game
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
hunters who who actually hunt grey
 
01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.950 align:start position:0%
hunters who who actually hunt grey
squirrels

01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
squirrels
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
but the second was the most telling and
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
said if there are
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
orphaned baby squirrels
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
we need to look first at the tragedy of
 
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
we need to look first at the tragedy of
roadkill

01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
roadkill
 
01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.390 align:start position:0%
roadkill
far

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
more of our squirrels are being taken
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
from the environment by our automobiles
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
than ever by a hunter and so
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
i i think this
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
this bill as originally proposed
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
would not solve that problem
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh because there just aren't the numbers
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
of of hunters that were going to change
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
the the numbers of orphans
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
versus automobiles so
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
i leave that
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
to your better judgment thank you
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative representative craig
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
i seem to recall that the motivation for
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
a complaint that the department was
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
a lack of satisfaction with the
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
department's response by not changing
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
the season
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
so i just find that an interesting
 
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
so i just find that an interesting
argument

01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
argument
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
that we should trust them
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
in now in opposition to the amendment
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%

just to refresh memories the original
bill

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.950 align:start position:0%
bill
was

01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
the hunting season for gray squirrels to
 
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.189 align:start position:0%
the hunting season for gray squirrels to
be

01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:12:13.199 --> 01:12:14.550 align:start position:0%
be
delayed

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
delayed
 
01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.669 align:start position:0%
delayed
um

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
while they were
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
weaning their young
 
01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:20.070 align:start position:0%
weaning their young
and

uh this amendment
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
takes the weight off of fish and game
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
for deciding when the hunting season
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
and basically have the legislature
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
declaring the grey squirrel as a gnosis
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
animal which should be hunted and killed
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
on site and i don't feel very good about
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%

01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment is adopted
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
the new motion is ought to pass as
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative howard
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
these are a nuisance animal uh we've
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony on this about
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
how much damage they do
 
01:14:47.679 --> 01:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
how much damage they do
um

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
for the most part hunters wouldn't hunt
 
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.270 align:start position:0%
for the most part hunters wouldn't hunt
them

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the summer anyways because you can't
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
see them up in the foliage
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't think hunting would have any
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
effect on their presence in the state
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
and i support the bill as a minute
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%

i'm going to vote no on the motion
 
01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.709 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote no on the motion
um

01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
otp as amended for the reasons i gave
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
earlier i think it's the purview and the
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility and the duty or whatever
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
you want to use the word for for fish
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
and game to declare
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
if gray squirrels should be hunted at
 
01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.510 align:start position:0%
if gray squirrels should be hunted at
will

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
and it should not be something that the
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i do have to concur
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
with my colleague
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we talk a lot about the rule-making
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
authority of fishing game and not
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
stepping into their world and giving
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
them the room to utilize the information
 
01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
that their
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
biologists their scientists
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
give to them
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
in managing wildlife and
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's important that we try to keep that
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
logic in mind as we vote on this bill so
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
i would not be in favor of this
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative i'm paul king right
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh harvey and
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative wolf can you turn off
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
so i i understand uh your point of view
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
that you want to
 
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
take the load off fish and game however
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
that is their job
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's why we appoint them
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
they serve it is their job
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
rather than it's a pleasant job or not
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
is is not um
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
it is their job to set limits and set
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
seasons despite what the general public
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
may or may not think it is also their
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
job to
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
follow through with the petition process
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
which did not happen in this particular
 
01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.669 align:start position:0%
which did not happen in this particular
case

01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:17:01.679 --> 01:17:02.870 align:start position:0%
case
so

01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard for me to say well
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
on one hand
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know they don't have to do their job
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
because it's unpleasant it's partisan
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
and on the other hand we have we say
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
they have to do their job because it is
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
their job i also do not believe that
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
wildlife in new hampshire should be a
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
partisan issue i think
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
good wildlife management benefits all of
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and the tourists that
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
comes in to our state and
 
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
so i would not like to see this bill or
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
any bill become a partisan issue thank

i'll i have a comment thank you mr
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
chairman so this bill was drafted on
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of a constituent who was disabled
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
you if you were here at the last
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing i read the testimony of
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
the person
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is paved with good intentions
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
but just because it's paid for good
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
intentions doesn't mean it's a good bill
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's got many flaws the biggest one is
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
financial impact two fishing game
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
um that's an estimate that's really hard
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
to come up with at this time so at this
 
01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.950 align:start position:0%
to come up with at this time so at this
point

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
the itl should stand
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make a comment on this bill
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see an amendment i'm passing
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
around on this bill
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
originally i looked at trying to figure
 
01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.950 align:start position:0%
originally i looked at trying to figure
out

01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned as we go forward in the
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
legislature every time we
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
force fish and game into giving a
 
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.550 align:start position:0%
force fish and game into giving a
discount

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
discount
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
that affects their revenue right they
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
can have an increased number of hunters
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
but less money to be able to support
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
those same number of hunters and they're
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
only they're they're
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
they're funded through
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
fees and so their only avenue would be
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
if they give a discount to one hunter
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
they got to raise the price for another
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
hunter for the program
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that's diminishing returns
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
where they can get to a point where they
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
can't do their job
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
and so my idea was to create a
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund that the legislature
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
would fund that they could draw
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
the difference between what the citizen
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
pays for a discounted and what the full
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
price is and draw out of that fund um
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
the money so that fishing game can meet
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
whole so to speak i still think that's a
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
great idea
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
the problem is we didn't have enough
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
time to execute it and and and to do it
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
right so i wanted to i gave out the
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that i started drafting and
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
worked on um the other problem with it
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
was when i finally got the number from
 
01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
fish and game on their expectation
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
because of this bill and the fact that
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at all disabled people not
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
just veterans not just
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
paraplegics the number was 1.3 million
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
dollars roughly they were estimating
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
because they were looking at how many
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
people are you know look at census data
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
for how many people are fully disabled
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and what
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
potential of only 10 percent of those
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
people apply for licenses what would
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
that look like and you know it was an
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
ugly number right and so i wasn't ready
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
to bring a dollar figure to fund the
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
fund uh go through i did have a
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with the speaker's office
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
and if we had come to a decent
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
resolution they were willing to send it
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
over to probably ways and means because
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's a going to be a a new permanent
 
01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:15.910 align:start position:0%
it's a going to be a a new permanent
fund

01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
that we'd be doing however it just isn't
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
quite ready for prime time but i want to
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
establish within the committee this
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
concept of every time we give a discount
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
fish and games the one that pays the
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
price and our hunters are the ones that
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
pay the price because
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
the fees come from the hunters and from
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
the trappers and from licenses and so
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
the only way fish and game can make up
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
that gap is to raise prices so the
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
legislature decides that we think
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
citizens should get a discount
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then we make every hunter and
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
fishermen pay for it right and if we're
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
going to do that if we the legislature
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
decide that we're going to give a
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
discount that we the legislature should
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
fund that and from that differential so
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
that agency can continue to do the
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement model that it needs
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
so i i not expecting any action on my
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
amendment i gave it to you so hopefully
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
maybe depending on what happens in the
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
next election depending on who's in
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
charge someone might bring forward an
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendment or a bill that might fill this
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
need and fix the problem
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
but we do have a diminishing returns
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
problem at fish and game and i am
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about it as the legislature
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
keeps doing this kind of work
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
and with that representative reid
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i agree with you
 
01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:22.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i agree with you
on

01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
making sure we fund that making sure
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the department has access to
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
general funds i also had spoken about an
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that i also after speaking
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
with ols and after speaking with the
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
licensing uh division
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
of the department realized it was far
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
too large of an of a
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislative change to to bring forth as
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
an amendment but i would like to see it
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
likewise as a future bill and that is
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
the idea that we are we have this kind
 
01:23:52.639 --> 01:23:53.750 align:start position:0%
the idea that we are we have this kind
of

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
quilt this patchwork
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
hodgepodge kind of
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
discounting and free license structure
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
but and we're giving away these licenses
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
to people who would otherwise certainly
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
buy those licenses but we're giving it
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
away based on things like previous
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
occupation in terms of veteran status
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
disability and age in every single one
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
of those populations there are people
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
who are perfectly capable of buying
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
those licenses and there are people who
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
if we stop giving the people who are
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
capable of buying the licenses free
 
01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.550 align:start position:0%
capable of buying the licenses free
licenses

01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
and instead change the discount to
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
simply an income base we in my in my
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with people we talked about
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
something like 2x the poverty line or
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
something like that then what we're
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
doing is we're getting rid of all of the
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
revenue loss the department is
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing and we are bringing more
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
people into hunting we're getting more
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
people out in the woods and i would add
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
those are the right people to get out in
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
the woods because those are the people
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
most likely to need to use the meat who
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
are literally it's not even necessarily
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
a sport it's they are have to feed their
 
01:24:54.239 --> 01:24:55.350 align:start position:0%
a sport it's they are have to feed their
families

01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
so um that's the thought that i've had
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
for the last several terms every time we
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
have one of these bills with a discount
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
um i think it's good for the department
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
to increase their revenue i think it's
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
good to get the right people out in the
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
woods and um having said that i
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
chose not to pursue an amendment because
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
it was too large for this particular
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
time thank goodness every
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
further comments representative wolff
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
um would it make sense to
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment and then interim
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
study the bill
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
again i thought about that but um again
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
i i did it this way for particular
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
reasons because i think it we can i tl
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
that people have seen the amendment they
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
can you know these commit committee
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
members are passionate about fish and
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
game and they can bring it forward a new
 
01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:41.650 align:start position:0%
bill next term
 
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:44.790 align:start position:0%
